4.8	Sail Date: Mar 24, 2019 /	Overall it was an amazing trip!  Went with 3 families, there was something for everyone.
5.0	Sail Date: Mar 24, 2019 /	This ship is mighty and has lots of activities. You will not get bored at all in the 7 nights.  Food and Service was great all through the ship. Lifetime experience!!
2.5	Sail Date: Mar 17, 2019 /	We are loyal Royal customers and I have to say this cruise was disappointing! We've been on the Allure as well and I am convinced the big boats don't care about their customers. The food and drinks were awful, cruise director and staff had minimal events going on around the boat. The Windjammer closed everyday at 8:45 pm! That left you with Sorrento's or the Promenade Café for the rest of the night. This trip did me in...no more cruises for a good while!
4.4	Sail Date: Mar 17, 2019 /	Enjoyed the ship - would do another Oasis class ship. Was pleased that there were enough deck chairs that could almost always find one available. Pools were small - especially in the Solarium. Was the smoothest ship I have ever sailed on!
2.8	Sail Date: Mar 17, 2019 /	NOT HAPPY WITH RC Customer guest relations!!!! They have taken no responsibility in ruing day 6 and 7 of my whole family’s cruise but being food safety negligent!!!!
4.1	Sail Date: Mar 10, 2019 /	Wonderful!  This is our 10th cruise I believe and seventh on Royal Caribbean. We really loved it!
4.5	Sail Date: Mar 10, 2019 /	By far, the best service we have received on any RC ship we have been on.  The dining room teach is the best!
4.5	Sail Date: Mar 10, 2019 /	wonderful trip, staffs are amazing. Room is smaller than I expected
4.0	Sail Date: Mar 10, 2019 /	We have enjoyed many cruises. Royal Caribbean at the top. This was a very large ship, largest we have crushed on. Probably go with a smaller vessel in the future. Food was great, not exceptional. Alcohol drinks too expensive, plus 18% gratuity every drink questionable.
4.0	Sail Date: Mar 03, 2019 /	"The buffet and the (no stress band )was disappointing  because they were not great at singing all genres of music rccl needed more variety of musicans that sing rock and Motown. 
But ev everything else was wonderful"
4.2	Sail Date: Mar 03, 2019 /	Great cruise.  Friendly staff.  Clean and very big.  Good entertainers .
4.0	Sail Date: Mar 03, 2019 /	Beautiful ship, excellent employees and lovely adult only pool area.
2.7	Sail Date: Mar 03, 2019 /	Very disappointed,. Not enough to do on ship.  Very little entertainment.
4.9	Sail Date: Mar 03, 2019 /	We had a great family vacation!  I can't complain about anything.  Thank you Oasis of the seas and every employee for making our vacation a memorable one!!  Fantastic.
4.8	Sail Date: Feb 24, 2019 /	Overall this was an excellent vacation. The only part that was not the best was too many ships porting in St. Marteen and St. Thomas was dirty.
5.0	Sail Date: Feb 24, 2019 /	That was the best ship by far that I have been on.
5.0	Sail Date: Feb 17, 2019 /	Excellent service all around ,,clean everywhere u look 5 stars for the food in the icon dinning room
4.5	Sail Date: Feb 17, 2019 /	Our family enjoyed both excellent Oasis of the Seas and all port of calls !
4.9	Sail Date: Feb 17, 2019 /	We have cruised as a family several times, but this was our first Royal Caribbean cruise.  Our 19 and 17 year old commented that this was the best one yet.  There are plenty of activities for kids there ages. We have already booked for next year!
4.5	Sail Date: Feb 17, 2019 /	We went on a cruise with two other families. Everyone enjoyed the ship. I would highly recommend this boat over Norwegian. The food was great the ship was clean and everyone enjoyed it.
4.9	Sail Date: Feb 17, 2019 /	If you took the time to read what I typed above, you have a good idea of what I think.  Sorry for any typos, but I am sure you get the idea.  We really enjoy Royal Caribbean.  Over the 17 years of sailing with the, (currently Diamond Plus) we have thoroughly enjoyed this cruise line.  They continue to improve their ships, the accommodations and venues and so many features and processes.  They work to provide first rate customer service.  Speaking of first rate customer service, I must mention our cruise agent, best of the best in the industry, a great communicator who knows so much about the cruise industry and has made so many great memories for my family and those I have referred to her.   cruise agent Danielle Smith.  For that next cruise, give her a call, see what she can do for you - - - .  I am sure that within the very first few minutes of your conversation that you will be impressed with her vast knowledge and experience of the cruise industry.  I hope yo will give her a call.  :  800-278-4737  extension 77182 (Monday to Friday).
4.3	Sail Date: Feb 17, 2019 /	Overall was a great cruise. Definilty had a great time and going again soon.
3.9	Sail Date: Feb 17, 2019 /	"Loved the Cruise Itinerary.  Enjoyed the every other day port calls as it left time to enjoy the beautiful ship.  Relaxed with the best roast beef sandwiches at the Central Park Cafe and released stress in the Jacuzzis.  On the disappointing side there were no happy employees.  Whomever hires and assigns staff did not have the right personalities in the right positions.  Not everyone has what it takes to work in hospitality services.  There was a noticeable absence of staff that was engaging and enthusiastic.  They even said so when asked: How was your day? Answer: ""All days are the same here"". An unhappy crew transforms into unhappy customers so in the end it dampens the otherwise great experience."
5.0	Sail Date: Feb 17, 2019 /	Great cruise.  We enjoyed all of it.  We had a very good room attendant, Head Waiter and Assistant Waiter.  All other attendants were courteous and very helpful.  Loved the Oasis of the Seas.  All shows were very good and enjoyable.  We did not care for the theater show of CATS.  The actors were good - not their fault we did not care for the theme or story of CATS.  We so enjoyed our cruise we booked another up coming cruise.  We have only booked on Royal Caribbean as we like the ships, the attendants have always been very good and great food.
4.8	Sail Date: Feb 10, 2019 /	Overall I enjoyed this cruise very much.  The size of the ship and crowd took a bit of time to get used to but caused very little trouble other than the reservations issue that I discussed before.  The staff was exceptional as expected and I can't wait to go again.
4.3	Sail Date: Feb 10, 2019 /	Overall a great time. Nice, clean ship. Good entertainment, good food, beautiful ports.
4.8	Sail Date: Feb 10, 2019 /	Loved every minute of it    We have 12 cruises booked in the next 12 months.  We always book back to back.  Save travel costs
4.4	Sail Date: Feb 10, 2019 /	Oasis is always nice.  This was our 4th cruise on this ship.
4.6	Sail Date: Feb 03, 2019 /	Please consider our service animal suggestions as we will certainly be cruising with you again.
2.9	Sail Date: Feb 03, 2019 /	"My husband bought our family, my son's friend, and my daughters family of four a cruise for Christmas. We were all very excited since this was our first time sailing with Royal Caribbean (our other cruises were all with Carnival) and we had heard that RC was better quality than Carnival. 

1)  The stateroom: We had four in our room and when we arrived there was only sleeping arrangements for 3. I had called twice before we cruised to ensure that we had a room for 4. We were supplied with a rollaway bed which blocked the balcony and took up much of our room space since it was positioned awkwardly. Very cramped the whole time and frustrating. We spoke with guest services and nothing else was available.

The state room also smelled very badly. The bed smelled like vomit (no exaggeration), the bathroom smelled like urine, and the room smelled like smelly shoes/feet. We knew that it would be outdated so I'm not rating it based on that. I could smell the lingering odor of vomit on my clothes after getting out of bed. The chair had stains all over it (including white/crusty stains).

2)  For Fee Dining Options: Many of the services on board were offered for a fee. For example, there are more dining options with a fee than there are without a fee. Many of the options without a fee were fast food/greasy food options (hotdogs, pizza, hamburger etc). One can only eat that kind of food so much. Many of these places had very long lines and closed early. We usually had to wait a long time in line and then it was hard to find seating. Carnival had many more options without a fee.

3)  Children's Program: We have grandchildren aged 3 and 5 years old that went into the children's program. Their parents signed them up initially. However, we (the grandparents) dropped them off and picked them up several times throughout the cruise. We were never asked (except once) for our identification, sea pass or child's sea pass. The only information we were asked was the room number. Additionally, ALL of counselors never seemed happy and appeared as though the children were an aggravation. Many of the activities that were supposedly scheduled did not happen (example: face painting) and the children were really disappointed. 

4) Shore Excursions: We chose a RC shore excursion in Haiti where we rode a boat to an area were the Haitians were supposed to explain their culture. Throughout the entire excursion, instead of focusing on the history, the locals were focused on soliciting the tourist. It was an obvious tourist trap as it was just a little walkway straight up a hill about 300 yards, where every corner you turned was locals asking for more money. Our son was wading in the water and even then the locals met him in a canoe asking for money. This was not our idea of learning their culture and was a very uncomfortable situation. Even the tour guide was pressuring everyone to donate/buy since the locals were poor. We ended up giving money at least 6 times during that excursion."
4.2	Sail Date: Feb 03, 2019 /	We will not cruise again. Not geared for people over 65. Maybe a river cruise on small boat. Too big, too loud, too much confusion.
4.4	Sail Date: Feb 03, 2019 /	"Once again, the ship is the thing!  Other than a little age, the Oasis class of ships is the standard.  Boardwalk end of ship seems to waste a lot of time with nothing occurring.  When there was entertainment, such as water show, Dixieland band, etc., the place fills up; conversely, when there is nothing special happening, the place is deserted (even the Dog Shack is closed a lot of the time)
 The parade on the Promenade deck was good and Central Park is a highlight."
4.9	Sail Date: Feb 03, 2019 /	Best cruise ship we have been on.  Best evening entertainment we experienced on a cruise ship.
3.9	Sail Date: Feb 03, 2019 /	We like the ship and the staff at the Central park bar were excellent. We don;t like the My Time seating and were disappointed that we had no option to change it.
5.0	Sail Date: Feb 03, 2019 /	Overall, we had a wonderful experience on the Oasis of the Seas !!
4.3	Sail Date: Jan 27, 2019 /	Considering the fact that the Oasis of the Seas is the largest ship afloat, with the most passengers, it was amazing that, at times, we found ourselves in areas of the ship with no one else in sight. The officers and crew did a fantastic job of organizing so many people and ensuring a fun cruise for everyone.

5.0	Sail Date: Jan 27, 2019 /	Our cruise was amazing as always. We definitely will be returning. Royal Caribbean's is the best!! Hands down.
5.0	Sail Date: Jan 27, 2019 /	Great ship, destinations, entertainment, food and service.
3.7	Sail Date: Jan 20, 2019 /	"Nice trip wonderful entertainment interesting boat.

Disappointing dining - but we are not foodies anyhow."
4.7	Sail Date: Jan 20, 2019 /	Think the diamond club needs to stretch their hours for our drinks, when early seating at 515 and then to a show, one doesn’t have any time to stop in.   I would love to see drinks available till 930.  No time to enjoy the lounge with a drink either.  Thank you.
4.5	Sail Date: Jan 20, 2019 /	The staff was awesome. Our server Kristtofer was the best as so was our cabin steward Dean Williams. Bartenders were right on queue they remembered our names and drinks. Sailed with husband and our two 24 and 25 granddaughters. They had a blast!
5.0	Sail Date: Jan 13, 2019 /	Excellent. I like everything on this cruise. Thank you
4.2	Sail Date: Jan 06, 2019 /	Royal Caribbean tried to make the best out of a bad situation.
2.3	Sail Date: Jan 06, 2019 /	If I cruise again, it will not be on such a large ship. Smaller ships are easier to get around and get into venues.
4.7	Sail Date: Jan 06, 2019 /	RCCL did a good job of making allowance for the virus and disruption that shortened our cruise.
4.8	Sail Date: Jan 06, 2019 /	Was fun, with virus outbreak spoiled the overall experience.
4.4	Sail Date: Jan 06, 2019 /	The weather was beautiful and the dinner cuisine was delectable. We had a relaxing, special time regardless of a virus outbreak and only visiting the first port. I appreciated being well informed regarding the situations with disembarking and the virus outbreak.
4.3	Sail Date: Dec 30, 2018 /	My son and i are now making a new year's cruise our tradition.
4.4	Sail Date: Dec 23, 2018 /	Pretty much enjoyed everything except the Jamaica port of call, the overly packed Windjammer and it's repetitive menu and the fact that there were too many kids on the ship, but it was Christmas week, so this is probably to be expected.   Oasis is a nice ship though and we loved Labadee and the other side of the island in Cozumel.
5.0	Sail Date: Dec 23, 2018 /	We love to cruise with RCCL. We are Diamond Plus.  We have not been disappointed by any of our voyages with them. Our next cruise is already booked to leave from Southampton to visit Madeira, Azores, Canary Islands and Lisbon (Portugal).
4.0	Sail Date: Dec 16, 2018 /	Royal Caribbean cruises are similar from one to another, familiar.  The staff is so helpful and cheerful!  There is a tendency to schedule several activities at the same time.  Wish there were more trivia games.  The cruising was calm.
4.5	Sail Date: Dec 16, 2018 /	This was my first on royal but I will be back I love the ships
3.3	Sail Date: Dec 09, 2018 /	"This is a copy and paste of what I provided RC with...
Embarking the ship took well over 3 hours of waiting standing up in a line (from 12h30 to 15h30...)
Outstanding Stateroom cleaning service by Ovidio. 5 stars
Outstanding Dining room service at table 951 (John and his assistant Sukhil) but his supervisor or Team Lead (not sure of her title) was quite annoying (unfortunately did not notice her name) as she often came (at least 3 meals out of 6) in the middle of the meal (or conversation) to see if everything was ok...she was quite insisting with all tables around us to give a 10 on the final evaluation. We felt we were treated like Grade one students and had to provide the RIGHT answer to give upon the evaluation. We were going to give a 10 for John and his assistant service anyways... We did not need anyone to tell us what the  scoring was. That kind of  is not needed on a classy ship like that. 
Our first night at the dinning room was not the best experience as we ended up at a table of 10 with 12 chairs...not pleasant to feel squished like sardines. Fortunately the Service Rep (Saskia or something like that ?...) that evening, once we complained, understood the situation and found a solution for our party of 4 for the next 6 evenings. Thanks. That gives us all a lesson to specify (upon buying the cruise) that we want to sit at a table of 4 for the 4 of us.
On day 6, we went to see the wave riders as I wanted my friend to perhaps experience that on her next cruise. (I have and know it is lots of fun). It was fantastic to see the 2 man instructors give all sorts of tips and demos to the riders to help them improve and enjoy their experience. After an hour or so: they were replaced by 2 younger girls . OMG: it was spectacular to see how those 2 blond girls could not care less about the riders. All they cared about was to make sure that everyone watching knew that they could dance, that they were cute. They NEVER paid any attention to what was going on in the surfing area. They never gave one tip to any of the riders. They did not even ask if this little girl was hurt after she went flying at the back. Long story short: they were there for everyone to see how good looking they are....I use to be a National Lifeguard and could not believe my eyes about the un-attending environment that those 2 were creating. I did not stay more than 15 minutes. I had seen enough. There is even a parent (a mother) that made a comment to me saying that this happened all week. I think it is important that you review this issue...Thanks.
Speaking of water experience. I also use to be a Customer Service Instructor (Service Plus)...I tell you that the attendant handing out towels needs training on that matter. Never saw him smile or thank customers during the week. Please verify what can be done for that service that happens to be THE FIRST point of contact at the pool.

An open smoking area near the pool is not really a good place to have one. There should be a CLOSED smoking area available on the ship.

It's hard to believe that in 2018 (almost 19)...there are still smoking on the ship. To go to the ice rink...most passengers (including children) have to walk through a very smoky area (the casino, on the 4th floor). To wait for diner on the 4th floor...is unpleasant for non-smokers as the casino is right there next to that nice dinning room. Terrible smell. Smoking should not be permitted at the casino. Smoking should be in enclosed area somewhere on the ship.

Card room on the 14th floor is unfortunately often used as a cafeteria or meeting room. There should be a sign on the door stating that this room is to be used for cards or board games; not for meetings. For example, on a rainy day, there were 12 people (not playing any games) that decided to take over a table for chatting, eating, discussing their next companies' decisions, etc. while a whole bunch of other passengers came in the door to see if they could play cards or something like that. This table left after 3 hours of not playing any game with food all over their table. We did not see any cruise ship attendant come during that period.

First night of our cruise, we went to see a show and were told that the 3 best rows were reserved. The show started and the seats remained empty for the whole show. We actually witnessed this issue at each show we attended during the week. We understand that the  had certain privileges but there should be a better system to allow for those seats to be used if not taken before 15 minutes of the showtime or something like that...

This was my second experience with RC and the first one for my friend that was not impressed with that kind of .
Thank you for your time.
Marie Tremblay"
3.6	Sail Date: Dec 09, 2018 /	The excursions were fun.  The ship has many fun things to do and see.  Being a large ship it still did not feel to crowded and did not have to wait long for things.  Dining was another disappointment for the second straight year.  Unfortunately you have to buy the upgraded dining package to have food worthy of an eloquent meal.
4.8	Sail Date: Dec 09, 2018 /	It is a fantastic journey for me and my family with RC cruise this time.
3.7	Sail Date: Dec 02, 2018 /	This cruise was just not for my husband and myself.  It was too large, which may be for some people.  We enjoy Celebrity cruises much more b/c we feel like we are treated like they want us to be there.
3.9	Sail Date: Nov 25, 2018 /	Shows were great and room was awesome. Not a lot of places to sit and look out on water (inside). Coke package was expensive and Coke had terrible taste. No FL vs GA football game, that was terrible.
2.8	Sail Date: Nov 25, 2018 /	Extremely packed, diamond plus members walk around with a chip on there shoulder, staff seemed disinterested except for in the main dining rooms, overall a mediocre trip. Won’t be returning to Royal carrbinean.
4.4	Sail Date: Nov 25, 2018 /	Lots to do, very clean ship, Room with balcony was very nice.  Enjoyed every moment of the cruise.
4.7	Sail Date: Nov 25, 2018 /	This was our 2nd time on the Oasis of the Seas... loved it as much as the first. It was great because we got to experience some things we missed the first time. We also got to see some shows for a 2nd time we loved.
4.5	Sail Date: Nov 18, 2018 /	Ship was clean and nice. Service and staff was great. We had a room right below the jacuzzi that kicked off and on. But didn’t bother me on the 14th floor. I’d pack less formal wear and more other next time.
4.8	Sail Date: Nov 18, 2018 /	Great relaxing cruise with 3 full days of cruising at sea.  Oasis is huge with lots to do, and still feels almost new.  Nassau is beautiful, but so many are trying to get their share of the tourists dollar that it is unpleasant to go ashore.
4.9	Sail Date: Nov 18, 2018 /	My Eastern Cruise experience was enjoyable, adventurous and relaxing. Thanks Royal Caribbean for a exceptional vacation.
4.8	Sail Date: Nov 18, 2018 /	Second time on Oasis class, still lives up to expectations
4.8	Sail Date: Nov 11, 2018 /	Great experience - next already booked look forward to January
3.8	Sail Date: Nov 11, 2018 /	Overall it was quite enjoyable. Certainly a good deal, monetarily. Blessed by those who helped us daily, primarily our room steward William and waiters, Kristopher and Eddie. And Romeo!! Love his attentiveness and sense of humor!
3.6	Sail Date: Nov 11, 2018 /	"My expectations for this ship were very high, unfortunately I just didn't feel ""wowed."" It wasn't a terrible trip being that it was still a vacation, I just don't think I'll be revisiting this ship. There were SO many people onboard that trying to maneuver around the ship took way too long."
4.8	Sail Date: Nov 11, 2018 /	Awesome ship, I will recommend to my friends and family.
4.9	Sail Date: Nov 04, 2018 /	We absolutly loved the cruise, all of the staff went above and beyond to be courteous and professional.... Our hats off to this fine group of folks.
4.2	Sail Date: Nov 04, 2018 /	Lots of fun! Great food (the pizza needs work though, fresh dough would be better) I didn’t find the indoor movie theatre but I may have just missed it. But over all a very clean and composed boat for someone looking to enjoy a vacation.
3.6	Sail Date: Nov 04, 2018 /	The mens bathrooms around the ship needed attention ,the solarium was missing tile and the grout had black mold , the solarium has no shade.
4.5	Sail Date: Nov 04, 2018 /	Hard to find an omelet station: none at windjammer or solarium, and Johnny rockets refused to allow me to get them to go, despite being out of tables.  Rockets cost jumped up from $6.95 to $11.50 making it overpriced.
5.0	Sail Date: Oct 28, 2018 /	Very much enjoyed the entire cruise, fine dining onboard and adventures at Ports...highly recommend Oasis of the Seas as your next cruise to the Islands.
4.5	Sail Date: Oct 28, 2018 /	We enjoyed the ship very much.  We did not get off in any of the ports (we've seen them all many times) but instead stayed onboard and enjoyed the quiet by the pool with our choice of chairs!
4.9	Sail Date: Oct 28, 2018 /	We loved everything about the cruise & the islands we visited. The only negative I have is that time on each island was very limited. We only got to do excursions - not really see any of the island outside of that. The food and the crew are outstanding on this ship in this cruise line. They went over and above on so many occasions.
4.9	Sail Date: Oct 28, 2018 /	the ship and crew were wonderful-  you are treated like royalty.  the ship was clean-  food was amazing-  cant say enough about our trip
5.0	Sail Date: Oct 28, 2018 /	I was a bit nervous going on a cruise ship of this size The ship never felt  Overly crowded. I was happy with the attitude of the entire staff The customer service of this ship rivaled Disney. Every single staff member was wonderful and Helpful. The customer service level of this ship may make us Royal Caribbean loyalists.
4.5	Sail Date: Oct 28, 2018 /	Well worth it, my husband a I decided that we will be cruising every year because of our experience on this cruise!
4.8	Sail Date: Oct 21, 2018 /	"Excellent customer service! Daycare was wonderful my daughter didn't want to leave Mr
CHICKEN NUGGET(he was awesome).
Stateroom was always clean and he anticipated our every need. Excellent!"
2.5	Sail Date: Oct 21, 2018 /	"Very boring.... preferably for older folks.
The staffin charge of kidswould rather be dead than take care of the little ones."
3.8	Sail Date: Oct 21, 2018 /	Great cruise!  We were told the ship was full, but I never felt it was overly crowded.  The pools were great and we never had to look endlessly for lounge chairs.  The food was ok, but typical for what I expect on a cruise ship.  Service staff was excellent all around!  The staterooms are small but adequate.  Storage is the staterooms is pathetic.  The shows were average (most notably Cats....which is simply too long of a show (2 hours) to use on a cruise ship.
4.5	Sail Date: Oct 21, 2018 /	Everything on the ship was amazing. We also did shore excursions through  but felt they could have been a little better other that  We had a good time.  We would definitely book again.
4.5	Sail Date: Oct 21, 2018 /	Surprisingly good service, specially when you consider the size of the ship and the number of passengers. Food in the main dinning room was disappointing (though, flavorless prime rib and dry, chewy fish-of-the-day). The specialty dinner at the Chops restaurant was great, except for the surly hostess; the food was very good and the service was outstanding.
4.0	Sail Date: Oct 21, 2018 /	I would recommend this to everyone.  Great children areas.need more access to ice cream after wipeout restaurant closes.
4.9	Sail Date: Oct 21, 2018 /	Great staff and activities, wish there were coffee stations available throughout the ship
5.0	Sail Date: Oct 21, 2018 /	Loved it!  Would do it again.   My mom rented her first scooter for the travelling throughout the ship.  That was a lifesaver at times.  Jeffrey did a great job as Cruise Director (we saw him last year too!).   We participated with other Facebook people and Cruise Critic people in a Meet and Mingle and also a Cabin Crawl.   It was lots of fun to see how other cabins really look, especially the suites.
4.3	Sail Date: Oct 21, 2018 /	We ate at table 602  at 5:30 pm . Our dinner staff was wonderful . Fang , She was from china .  Himinsheu, he was  from India  . I would come back if we could have them take care of us again  . Please give them a big reward . They realy out did themselfs the whole cruise .
4.9	Sail Date: Oct 21, 2018 /	the weather was fine the port were nice and clean the staff was realy friendly
4.4	Sail Date: Oct 21, 2018 /	Typical RC professional staff....always making the guest feel welcome...
4.4	Sail Date: Oct 14, 2018 /	Cruise was great, entertain can be better and should not require reservation. The casino has a so called smoking and non-smoking session which is opened and right next to each other. I could not enjoy the casino due to the smoke even though I was on the non-smoking side.
4.7	Sail Date: Oct 14, 2018 /	This is first cruise in Caribbean Sea, tropical weather is wonderful, I enjoyed it.
3.1	Sail Date: Oct 14, 2018 /	The Oasis Is Beautiful And Crowd Management Is Great.   The Dining Service Was Excellent.   The Room Attendant Was Great.
2.6	Sail Date: Oct 14, 2018 /	Let down by the whole experience.  Nothing special about this ship or the destination.  The best part of the experience was leaving the ship.
4.9	Sail Date: Oct 14, 2018 /	Just Exceptional!! Great  entertainment they accommodate your children and the food is just great. We stopped at a lot of ports and had so much fun at the beach thank you for making another great vacation .
3.8	Sail Date: Oct 07, 2018 /	Overall, this cruise was not worth the amount of money I spent on it. While the service at dinner was great I felt as if I was just a pig being lead to the slaughter wherever I went due to the large number of people on the boat. I also felt as if bevause I wasn't a platinum or diamond member I was considered second class on the boat at areas like the show or on the private island. I will not be returning to this boat again and I am honestly very frustrated with Royal Caribbean so it will be a long time before I cruise with this line again.
3.7	Sail Date: Oct 07, 2018 /	The cruise overall was good, food was okay but not great, the ship had lots of activities, but the kids club and buffet left a lot to be desired.
4.1	Sail Date: Oct 07, 2018 /	It was the best of times, it was the not so best of times....
4.2	Sail Date: Oct 07, 2018 /	The one BIG negative is the new emergency drill video. It is painful to watch, reminds me of a cartoon and NO-BODY paid attention after about 2 min. Because of this terrible video it takes twice as long to do get the drill info. Almost 40 min. from the time you arrive until you are released. They need to stop the video and return to personal instruction and demonstration.
5.0	Sail Date: Oct 07, 2018 /	cruise was great and so was the staff and the Becca Reaves who booked the cruise for us.
4.3	Sail Date: Oct 07, 2018 /	Great cruise, but this is a big ship which means lots of people and elevators get really busy at times. Be prepared for continually being asked to buy drink packages and upgraded dining...all at a high cost.  Shore excursions organized by the ship are the best, but once again be prepared to pay more than you might off the ship. Overall a good week and on our cruise the three days at sea were welcome.
5.0	Sail Date: Oct 07, 2018 /	Big ship lots of fun stuff to do, kids program is wonderful.
5.0	Sail Date: Oct 07, 2018 /	Had a great time celebrating our 40th wedding anniversary.
5.0	Sail Date: Oct 07, 2018 /	special thanks to Gulia from Turkey, she did remarkable job with reservation sitting table for dinner, our waiter Hitesh and  assistant waiter Jen Ross they were super nice and friendly to us all the time and Windjummers cafe manager( outstanding job has been done), also waitress Jonabel Acula from same cafe, she helped us a lot.
3.9	Sail Date: Oct 07, 2018 /	My husband & I are Diamond Members. This is our 12th Cruise with Royal Caribbean. We had to go on one of the Oasis Class ships to see if we like them.  Seven days isn't enough to do everything on the ship or see everything.  We usually choose 12 night cruises.  We have one booked for December 2019.
3.2	Sail Date: Oct 07, 2018 /	As I shared in my posts the cruise was good. This was our 8th cruise but not our favorite. It started with the steamer getting taken with nobody being able to tell us why and it continued with the lack of entertainment. The ports were all good with st Martin being the best. Labedee had changed with a lot lore people trying to get you to buy stuff but the beach is still wonderful. Will cruise with royal again but I will base it off of entertainment that is being offered.
4.8	Sail Date: Sep 30, 2018 /	Dining room staff attentive and wanted to make your time with them excellent.  Cabin attendant made our trip perfect.
4.8	Sail Date: Sep 30, 2018 /	Was very happy with our first Cruise on Royal Caribbean. I was handicapped and could not do a lot. Beautiful Ship.
3.9	Sail Date: Sep 30, 2018 /	Love RCCL but won't go on the Oasis anymore.  Not enough to do without standing in long lines.
4.8	Sail Date: Sep 30, 2018 /	My family me and my husband had amazing time !!! Thank you !!!
3.7	Sail Date: Sep 30, 2018 /	Our cruise experience was a lot of fun. The ship was clean and the staff was friendly. The room tenants are very helpful in answering any questions you have. The best experience for us on the ship was going to Vitality Spa. The staff there was very professional and nice. The spa felt like a resort. I would highly recommend this cruise!
5.0	Sail Date: Sep 30, 2018 /	Had the best time on this cruise. Booked another one already!
4.9	Sail Date: Sep 30, 2018 /	Great cruise vacation! Food, service and all around experience was amazing!! I would definitely cruise with Royal Caribbean again!
4.4	Sail Date: Sep 30, 2018 /	Had a wonderful time on this ship.  Our waiters, Alfredo and Sanjay were just great and the food was good.  The entertainment was very good, but we didn't like Cats.  Could somebody next time pick a musical with more of a story to it?  This ship is very pretty.  We loved Central Park and the Vintages wine bar.  That was our favorite area.  More movies would be nice.
4.5	Sail Date: Sep 30, 2018 /	"First couple days on the ship were pretty rocky, coat hangers clanging and bathroom door slamming shut. I have a stronger stomach than my Girl Friend and i was still ready to try sea bands and patches. first day didn't eat much but got STUFFED at dinner it was consistently amazing and surprisingly so every time!! second day dove into the food and activities, the boat was rocking still and we had the DLX drink package but had to cancel because my Girlfriend doesn't drink really and i didn't wanna force myself to down 1000 dollars in booze if we were gonna keep rocking so much... Day 3 in Haiti was fun but be careful because the souvenir shops can be aggressive in there hustle especially with each other. good lunch and had a blast on the jet skis definitely gonna try the zip line if we go back. Ohhh and another amazing dinner with Manuel and Iputu we literally requested them every night we could most delightful part of the cruise. Day 4 Jamaica was a blast, different from my previous trip as a child but still so fun, would of enjoyed Bob Marley's tour but it had left so we did Dunns for my second time my GF's first. still awesome! Day 5 don't remember much but Dinner... Day 6 the Xplor Package is the only way to go..... by far the most amazing excursion ever, i wish they had a theme park like it near us!! the buffet for lunch was 5 star all day. Day 7 at sea was cool Paul O. the comedian is hilarious saw his 
 kid friendly, adult, and new stuff thru out the 7 days and it really made me wanna go to comedy shows around here more often because it was hilarious and made a great date every time watching him. Also won the Pool volleyball tournament enjoyed that."
4.4	Sail Date: Sep 30, 2018 /	our waiter Frankie main dining 3rd. floor and room service was Germaine,  both were fantastic
4.8	Sail Date: Sep 30, 2018 /	So much fun!  Staff was so friendly and service was outstanding.  I felt like Royalty on this trip.  The food was great, and the ports of call where very nice.  Only thing i was not expecting was the crowds.  At times you have to wait in line for food and on elevators.  But even with that said it was not at all a damper on our trip.  The boat was clean, but you can tell it is an older ship for the oasis class, there is some rust on places and a few stains on the carpet in my stateroom.  But not at all enough to make us uncomfortable.  The ship was beautiful.  We will definitely go on the Oasis again.
4.6	Sail Date: Sep 23, 2018 /	We have been on several cruises. This boat was by far the best!
4.7	Sail Date: Sep 23, 2018 /	"Amazing week. great bang for the buck! 
I really want to acknowledge our dinner server, Ronnie. He was the best server we've ever had on a cruise. He was funny, timely, attentive, thorough, extremely present, and made the time with my kids that more special. He truly went above and beyond. We were only able to dine with him a few times bc his section was full the others, but he really made our over all experience that much better!!! Thank you Ronnie!!!!!"
4.5	Sail Date: Sep 23, 2018 /	Excellent services. Beautiful boat. Good food and drinks
4.8	Sail Date: Sep 23, 2018 /	We thoroughly enjoyed our first Oasis class experience. Customer service second to none. Entertainment on Royal Caribbean's large ships is second to none. We are excited to experience Harmony when it arrives in Port Canaveral.
4.5	Sail Date: Sep 23, 2018 /	"I spent several days back and forth with Guest Services regarding my on-board credit from .  I was finally patched through to  and we resolved my on-board credit issue.  I was assured while on that call that my specialty dining and pre-paid gratuities. were on my account.  When I made my reservations with Chops Grill the next day I was told there were no specialty dining credits on my account.  I had to go to Guest Services again.  The girl wasn't very helpful.  She finally told me to take the invoice that I had brought from  to the restaurant to prove my promotion.  I thought that was odd.  The night we were dining, I called GS again just to verify the information I had been given.  Again I was told just to take the invoice with me.  The night after we dined at Chops, when we returned to the cabin, I had a note on the door to call 3333 regarding ""My Concern"".  I wasn't sure what this was for.  I called and was being questioned about the specialty dining promotion and was told I did not receive that.  I kept explaining everything I had been through and that I had gone to the front desk and called multiple times trying to resolve this issue prior to dining in Chops and showed my invoice proving I had this promotion from .  The lady said well we need to verify this.  She said she would call Chop Grill to discuss it and to get a copy of my invoice.  I said they don't have a copy.  I hate to admit it, but by this point I was upset.  I said, I am tired of dealing with this and I don't want to hear anything else about it.  My husband called back and also let them know that I had spent several days back and forth with the front desk and we didn't want to be bothered with it again.  She said consider the issue resolved!  The next day, I checked my account and I had 2 excursions on my account that I had not booked.  I called back and went Off!  They removed them.  I spent almost every day of the trip dealing with Guest Services for something.  It was beyond frustrating!"
2.5	Sail Date: Sep 23, 2018 /	Was definitely not the best cruise weve been on. Seems like price went up and quality went down.
3.3	Sail Date: Sep 23, 2018 /	This was our 6th Royal Caribbean Cruise & this cruise was disappointing.  We ate @ the buffet for breakfast & lunch & the dining room for dinner.  The food choices were limited on this cruise. What was upsetting was the staff was not courteous @ the buffets.  If a passenger was walking with a plate full of food the staff member would continuously walk right in front of the passenger rather than allow the passenger to pass first. Our wait staff, Barry & Alex @ 8:15pm seating, in the dinning room were wonderful & made our dinning experience that much better!  My husband fell on our 2nd day of cruising, we went to the doctor on board almost every day to have his leg bandaged & checked.  He was provided with crutches & a wheel chair that he unfortanly needed to get a round.  The medical staff were all wonderful & were greatly appreciated.
4.6	Sail Date: Sep 23, 2018 /	Great ship with lots to do, excellent entertainment and good value.  Watch the Captain and Cruise Director's show every morning on Channel 14 for helpful information and a jovial presentation.
4.5	Sail Date: Sep 23, 2018 /	I would think twice about going on another RC cruise,
4.0	Sail Date: Sep 23, 2018 /	"The ship is a thing of wonder.  Who thought something that big could float.  I cannot imagine the logistics it takes to feed and move that many people.  It was one of those bucket list items.  There were almost too many things to do.  There were plenty of deck chairs.  But there were some drawbacks.  The Adult only area (Solarium) is at the front of the ship and almost enclosed in glass which made it feel like a sauna.  When I sat out on deck, I had to move over to the side of the ship.  I purchased the soda package with the cup which can be used at the Coca-Cola Freestyle machines of which there are 6 on the boat. (4 in the Windjammer and 2 on the Royal Promenade)  It is a great concept, if the machines worked consistently, which wasn't the case on this cruise.  Hence, the lines for soda.  I complained to Guess Services, but it didn't seem to help.  You could get soda at the bar, but not the same selection as the machines.  
I'm enjoyed the cruise and can check it off my list. I may try one of the other larger ships, but I can honestly say I had as much fun on the Liberty and Navigator as I did on the Oasis.  They had most of the same amenities (minus Central Park and Boardwalk) but less of the crowds."
3.7	Sail Date: Sep 16, 2018 /	It's a very large ship. At times felt that it was understaffed for the amount of people on board. It's beautiful and has a lot of activities all the time.
3.7	Sail Date: Sep 16, 2018 /	Overall I definitely do not recommend the Oasis.. Too outdated and broken down, coke machines, hot tubs, bathrooms... Choose Harmony or a newer ship!
4.9	Sail Date: Sep 16, 2018 /	Great ship and a wonderful time!  Third time on the Oasis of the Sea
5.0	Sail Date: Sep 16, 2018 /	This was our 4th cruise and we had an amazing time.  My only concern and improvement I would recommend is changing the age group for access to the Solarium.  Sometimes adults just need a break from noisy teenagers amd the Aolariumis the place that we can get the relaxation we need.  Change the entry age from 16 to 21 or even 25.
2.9	Sail Date: Sep 09, 2018 /	The level of service we have had on past cruises (38) all with under 3000 passengers was far from good.  Most of the crew was distant, unfriendly, with some being rude.  Trying to get the simplest thing cause running all over the ship because crew members themselves don't know where to find things.  We wanted to see what it was about, and left never wanting to do large ships again.
4.4	Sail Date: Sep 09, 2018 /	Vacation with my dad who is 93. Easy to get around the ship and get on and off the ship.
4.9	Sail Date: Sep 09, 2018 /	Tons of fun and lots of sun. The staff and cruisers were Pleasant and fun
4.4	Sail Date: Sep 09, 2018 /	We’ve been on over 25 cruises, most with Royal Caribbean but none on an Oasis class ship. This was our favorite. Many things to do onboard. Service right up there with the best and wonderful shows.  Could get a bit crowded in certain venues and the beds were hard but otherwise a real treat. We’d love to sail on this class of ship again!
4.7	Sail Date: Sep 09, 2018 /	The ship is clean and the crew is very friendly (mostly). Alcoholic drinks are very expensive, so the Deluxe Drink package is recommended.
4.3	Sail Date: Sep 09, 2018 /	"We had a lovely time despite me getting terrible sea sickness my first day which lingered through the rest of the trip even with medication. This was my first cruise so I wasn’t sure what to expect, but the ship was so beautiful with so much to do and so much to eat! Dom and Nick from the activity staff are so much fun. I work with seniors and despise bingo but they made me want to play like 4 times lol so that says a lot. The comedians were amazing as well, we saw them 3 times. The ice skating show was incredibly impressive. The stunts they were able to do on such a small rink was unimaginable. It was awesome that we could skate on it too even though the ice was pretty rough by the time we got on it. We caught the Come fly with me show which was great as well even though I didn’t quite understand the storyline. My husband enjoyed the outdoor movies, I felt seasick when I was on that part of the ship so I didn’t partake. I wish there were more tv channels or at least an all dreamworks movie channel! After seeing the characters all around the ship, I was dying to watch Trolls or Madagascar! Meeting Branch and Poppy was a big highlight of our trip though!! The food was great. We ate most of our meals in the windjammer cafe. You can’t beat the selection and how fresh and hot everything was for a buffet. The staff was so attentive and friendly in there even when it was a mad house. We ate at American Icon once but felt our service was kinda subpar and I felt seasick in that room so we didn’t do another meal there. The food was good there though. I loved the beach salt water pool so much. I spent a lot of time in there especially at night when it was quiet. I liked that that pool stayed open until 11pm especially since floating in the pool helped me adjust to being on a ship and eased my sea sickness. I enjoyed that there was drink service right at the pool as well... makes up for there not being a swim up bar (I imagine that would be difficult to have on rougher waters). I was disappointed about a few things though. I was so excited to have towel animals done in our room but every day we didn’t get one so I figured Royal Caribbean didn’t do that but then on night 6 we overheard people in the elevator talking about what animals they got each night. It seems like a small thing but I was really sad and felt left out about it. So I said something and got swans for our last night at least lol. I didn’t think that was something you had to request.... Also, this was our honeymoon and the cruise line was aware of this when we booked but we didn’t get any special decorations or acknowledgments like we saw on other rooms who had signs from royal Caribbean for their birthday or anniversary. We wished they made us feel a little more special. And lastly we decided since it was our honeymoon that we were going to splurge at the spa. We got 3 premium treatments each and the treatments were fantastic however the relaxation ended immediately after each treatment because the staff there are so pushy to sell the expensive products they used and made me feel very uncomfortable. Every single session this happened all with different staff members. My husband said it happened to him too, and he can’t say no so he bought some of it. It’s a very vulnerable spot to be in after someone spent over an hour working on your body and make you feel like you have to buy their overpriced products after you just spent a lot on their overpriced spa packages. 
Overall though I really enjoyed the cruise. I probably will not come back due to the sea sickness but will definitely recommend this ship to my friends and family. I’ll just tell them to avoid the spa and call ahead of time to make sure you get a towel monkey hanging in your state room."
5.0	Sail Date: Sep 09, 2018 /	WE WERE WORRIED ABOUT IT BEING SO MANY PEOPLE ON THE SHIP...BUT IT WAS AWESOME DID NOT FEEL CROWDED AT ALL.. WE COULD OF STAYED ANOTHER 7 DAYS EASILY... THIS IS DEFINITELY THE CRUISE TO GO ON
5.0	Sail Date: Sep 09, 2018 /	I would like to thank Yolanda for all the cool towel animals she made. Very polite and liked to joke.  To the awesome bartender (Iputu) we had he knew how to mix our drinks right and played some games. We all had a great time on the ship.
3.7	Sail Date: Sep 09, 2018 /	We booked our excursion at the same time as the ship. Mexico was awesome. Jamaica was awesone on the excursion. Our transportation was horrible. It was through the excursions group. The drive took us out of the way to go shopping g and recieved kick backs from the store owners for bringing us there. On the way he drove us through horrible parts of town that had my wife. Whom works in law enforcement a kit to nervous.  But the drive getting kick back for taking us places we disnt want to go was pathetic and should not be allowed. I would nevwr book that again and not recommend it to anyone
5.0	Sail Date: Sep 09, 2018 /	"We decided to treat ourselves to a coffee and soda beverage package. Cost was $290. For both.(worth it as we love coffee specialties). When we boarded we found that because we booked an inside boardwalk balcony room (excellant room!) We were given another 2 packages and we couldn't get reimbursed for our first purchase. Would have been nice to know. Wonderful cruise anyway. Staff on board was incredibly great!
  Now, the ship staff was incredibly great!! Clean clean ship!!"
4.2	Sail Date: Sep 09, 2018 /	Not sure why they insist you write a 50 word overview of your cruise when you already stated with the questions that they ask how your cruise was. SMH
3.2	Sail Date: Sep 09, 2018 /	The ship is too large and too crowded. I prefersmaller ships
4.3	Sail Date: Sep 09, 2018 /	Staff was very pleasant never a bad  attitude. Ship was clean and lots to do.
5.0	Sail Date: Sep 09, 2018 /	"Our room steward, Jean,  was very friendly and did his best to accommodate our needs. Our room was always clean, the ice bucket was always full. He asked daily if there was any thing we needed.
Alston in the Windjammer was great. He would see us looking for a seat and always helped find one quickly. He learned that my wife and I drank Ice tea with lemon and it was on our table when we returned from getting our food. he would stop by our table and ask if we needed anything. My wife is Lactose Intolerant. He told the restaurant manager Awan who addressed this with my wife by bringing the chef to help her pick food choices  that would not upset her stomach.
Great service above and beyond what was expected."
5.0	Sail Date: Sep 02, 2018 /	This was my first cruise and it was the best experience that I’ve ever had vacationing. Honestly if I could give every writing a six out of five I would, the oasis being the oldest of the megaships was still up to par in every way that I can imagine there was never a time that I was bored the crew and staff were both amazing and friendly. I wish everyone could have a chance to experience the oasis of the seas!
4.6	Sail Date: Sep 02, 2018 /	"We did not get off at Nassau and St Thomas since we had been there many times. We had not been to Phillipsburg since the hurricane of 2017.  Some reconstruction on the waterfront buildings was still in progress.  Water taxi took us to far drop off point instead of close to center of town.
Dinner and cabin service was above and beyond.  Could have used more movies offered during all days as we had been on the ship before and had seen all of the entertainment before."
4.7	Sail Date: Sep 02, 2018 /	We had an amazing time.  We enjoyed so many events & met so many great fellow cruisers & staff.  Our cabin steward Fernando was very friendly. Always had a smile on his face & a warm greeting. Kept our cabin spotless. Our dining room staff Noellyn & Oka were exceptional. Their food & wine recommendations were spot on. Service was amazing. They accommodated our every wish.  Made for a very pleasant dining experience. Loved the ship can’t wait to return.
3.9	Sail Date: Sep 02, 2018 /	"Overall, service was great compared to another cruise line (name starts with N) we took for our last cruise. We were a little disappointed in the amount of time it took for housekeeping to shampoo our cabin's carpet after I reported the room smelling like ""Pee"" on the very first day. They did not shampoo the carpet until the third day. It was disgusting to live and walk on the carpet that smelt like urine. Staff was great. Everyone greeted us with a smile and eye contact as we passed by various sections of the ship. Also, we would have appreciated the entertainment staff to be more engaging and fluent in English language while hosting their respective activities/game shows. For example, we had the ""Perfect Couple"" game show in Dazzles on the last night of our cruise and the Brazilian native host did not speak good English, could not explain the game rules, could not engage the audience and did not understand the responses she received from American speaking audience. For example, she did not know what ""Teal"" color was. Also, she seemed to be unfair towards the black couple throughout the game by giving them less chances and giving white couples more chances and tries to play the game."
4.9	Sail Date: Aug 26, 2018 /	"Beautiful cruise but activities should be planned out that the shows arenjot all the same time scatter around so everyone can get a chance to see all
Shows some nights was really nothing to do"
3.9	Sail Date: Aug 26, 2018 /	Nice ports.  Love Labadee and St Maarten, could do without San Juan.  Choice of food is lacking overall in buffet and main but quality makes up for it.  Lack of late night option (other than pizza and room service) is a bummer as we loved doing late night snacks and ice cream with thr kids at Carnival and don't like to do room service. Awesome entertainment with the different shows.  I dont really understand the draw for cats but love the other shows.  Also worth mentioning that i didn't feel the waves like i do with smaller ships.  Highly recommended.
4.6	Sail Date: Aug 26, 2018 /	I truly only have one negative comment-the first night we visited the Spa and while our massages and services were good we were told one price and charged another.  My husband went to discuss with them and could not make them understand why we were frustrated.  We received a couple massage and they charged us individually.
4.9	Sail Date: Aug 26, 2018 /	From the time you check in, it's an adventure. Everyday was something new to find or do. Take your time and see the ship a little in sections.
4.7	Sail Date: Aug 26, 2018 /	We had an overall great vacation with the exception of missing more music around the pool areas and the decks being slippery near the pools. Our friend traveling with us fell twice due to slipping on water. I would like to encourage the cruise line to have interpreters for their staff members that aren't fluent in English. We had a minor medical emergency with one of our other friends that traveled with us. She was very sick in her room and her cabin attendant did not speak English, which held up the process of her receiving medical attention timely.
4.5	Sail Date: Aug 19, 2018 /	I had amazing wonderful time, the spa can be price high, you will have an amazing experience.
4.6	Sail Date: Aug 19, 2018 /	We really enjoyed our cruise, and found the amenities, crew and overall experience to be very positive.  This is a great cruise for large groups, families and anyone looking for extensive onboard amenities.  Despite the number of people, it seldom felt crowded.  The few exceptions required only brief waiting times, or making reservations to insure your space.  Everything was well coordinated and clearly well organized.  We would highly recommend this cruise.
5.0	Sail Date: Aug 19, 2018 /	This cruise is a must. Great food, great ports of call, and wonderful shows. You will not regret booking.
3.2	Sail Date: Aug 19, 2018 /	We actually cancelled another cruise on the allure in the grand suite because the service and the food was not good. It seems that the emphasis is on entertainment, but the food was mediocre.
4.5	Sail Date: Aug 12, 2018 /	Had a terrific time because we were spending time with family and you don't let the small things ruin any vacation. We had fabulous waiter/busboy and Cabin Attendant.  Guest Services were helpful and friendly as was most of the staff onboard.  But just too big of a ship. Prefer the smaller ones and this is our 30th cruise so we have past experience.
4.5	Sail Date: Aug 12, 2018 /	St. Maarten has not recovered at all from the hurricane in 2017.  There were a few shops open at the port, but the rest of the island is just decimated.  We rented a Jeep to tour the island and even the Jeep had issues!  Seatbelts weren't working - doors didn't open.  It had been tossed around in the hurricane and was in bad shape.  I thought we would be able to help with the recovery by spending some money - but most places were closed still.  San Juan was gorgeous - went to the rainforest and while much of it is still closed, what we saw was beautiful and lush.  Labadee was fun.  Very secluded but Barefoot Beach was pristine and relaxing.  Watch out for the little jellyfish, but other than that lots of fun!
3.3	Sail Date: Aug 12, 2018 /	Little things wrong add up to biggest $3,500 ripoff. First day choked on rubber band in chicken in Solarium, head waiter Wrote my cabin # down, nothing else. All food in Windjammer nursing home food. Every thing was pork or steamed chic, sauced too much,bacon burnt or raw. Don't get an alcoholic nev in Windjammer, takes 20 mins, your foods ice cold by then, we c/o'd to the Head waiter their about horrible food, nothing happened. Spent 1100 on 7 day drinks, nickel n dined to total of$400 for
4.6	Sail Date: Aug 12, 2018 /	Overall Oasis is a great ship. We took a cruise on Harmony (sister ship) when is was brand new and this compares. I would love to try this ship again once they change shows and update the ship!
4.4	Sail Date: Aug 12, 2018 /	Great overall experience. We have been in Radiance, Jewel, Liberty (twice) and the Oasis class is by far the best ever. We booked a cruise in the Allure for next year already. Try to be smart when is time to eat because there are plenty of great options and some not that good. The only place that you can feel the people is on the pool decks, everywhere else things flows very well. Do not waist your time going to Cats Show. Book and  enjoy your cruise!
5.0	Sail Date: Aug 05, 2018 /	we sat at table 148 at the American Icon the wait staff was the best I have ever seen!!!
4.4	Sail Date: Aug 05, 2018 /	was horrible from the start, never got the onboard credit that was promised, while everyone else in my party got $150. I will never I repeat, NEVER book another cruise with  ever!!
5.0	Sail Date: Jul 29, 2018 /	I love this cruise and it never give us a boring time.  There is always something going on, Zipline, wall climbing, ping pong, mini-golf, court-game, bingo, shows, dinner, ice-cream. it was a fun week.
5.0	Sail Date: Jul 29, 2018 /	Went on the cruise for R&R purposes only. Didn't bring formal attire, ate in Windjammer or other casual dining facilities only. Love the entertainment!  Our cabin steward was one of the best we've ever had - Dean.  Love the Solarium pool, especially on port days when everyone is off the ship!
4.8	Sail Date: Jul 29, 2018 /	Great time great staff.  Cruise director not the best we've had on board.  Ship was amazing though.
4.4	Sail Date: Jul 29, 2018 /	This was a very nice cruise. For a large ship, the lines were not that long. Very easy to get on and off the ship. Deck 5 was only used as a track for runners and walkers. BEST running on any ship I have ever been on.
4.3	Sail Date: Jul 29, 2018 /	It was a great trip.  Everyone in the family had a great time.  Looking forward to next cruise.
4.8	Sail Date: Jul 29, 2018 /	We love this ship.  It is our third time going on it and we plan to do it again!
3.8	Sail Date: Jul 29, 2018 /	We had some very bad experiences onboard.  The majority of the RC employees are very nice and helpful.  Unfortunately this was ruined by a few experiences that should have never happened.
5.0	Sail Date: Jul 29, 2018 /	We will definitely travel with Royal Caribbean International again!  We are already looking at a cruise of the Hawaiian Islands for 2019!!  I would recommend, if you have never cruised before or if you have never cruised with Royal Caribbean International, give it a try.  My bet is this, you will be spoiled by RCI, if you choose to travel with them first and then follow up with another cruise line.  You will definitely return to Royal Caribbean International.  I know we will!!
3.3	Sail Date: Jul 22, 2018 /	"The ship is so big that you spend a lot of time walking from one end to the other.  It is also not like you are really on a ship because you can't feel the ocean sway when you are in port or on the sea.  It is more like a floating island.  

There were many entertainment snafus that caused cancellation of shows.  Then it was hard to figure out what the replacement shows were going to be until much later.  You had to be continuing re-planning entertainment activities.  The Royal Carribean app was subpar and not updated with the latest information and did not support links to find where things were happening."
4.7	Sail Date: Jul 22, 2018 /	Very nice, fun, memorable cruise! My wife and I had so much fun and so many things to do! I hope all my future cruises are like this one!
4.7	Sail Date: Jul 15, 2018 /	Wow!!Where do I start.. My family cruise was so amazing and the ship was breath taking away. The staff was so awesome, hardworking. I want to give a special thank to my Dinning server (Yian table# 422) he was so helpful in all ways. I would like to Thank Karen who kept our room clean every day. Overall everyone was kind and willing to help to make our seven days cruise comfortable as possible. Two Thumbs up, if I had 10 thumbs I would give all to the staff on the OASIS OF THE SEA.. Looking forward to my next trip in March.
4.8	Sail Date: Jul 15, 2018 /	This was an amazing ship and everyone was really great that worked on it.  Our steward was fabulous greg on the 8th floor
3.9	Sail Date: Jul 08, 2018 /	Dont expect entertainment all day. Miss the midnight buffet, chocolate buffet, ice carvings on ships. Spa and fitness staff looking to only sell. Spa staff at free seminars abrasive/loud. Stores on ship either VERY high end or junk. If you dont like changing waiter staff in dining, dont do mytime dining. Around 8 pm busiest time to eat. Recommend Chops. Ship very clean.
4.5	Sail Date: Jul 08, 2018 /	Only one complaint, The bed was entirely to firm for my liking it was close to sleeping on the floor for me and my preference is a firm mattress.
4.6	Sail Date: Jul 08, 2018 /	The Cruise Ship should not allow very young children or babies to go to the specialty dining when others have paid a lot of money to have a great dining experience.  We had to sit throughout our dinner while a 4 to 5 month old screamed their head off.  This was the only night we spent extra money for a nice meal and experience and it was not pleasant at all.  The waiter kept apologizing.  We did not let it affect how we tipped him, but we couldn't get out of there fast enough.  The Cruise Ship should have rules in place for situations like these.
4.3	Sail Date: Jul 08, 2018 /	"We had a wonderful family vacation on Oasis of the Seas.  There are so many great activities.  Our favorites were rock climbing, flow rider, zip lining, and mini-golf, and ice skating.  I also enjoyed using the track and the gym.  My Time Dining was perfect for our family as we don’t like be set to the same schedule each night.  Do NOT go on the Royal Caribbean Falmouth, Jamaica shore excursion called
 “A Place in the Sun”.  It was a horrible experience.  Other than that, the ship is awesome and the service is great.  I would definitely sail on any one RC’s Oasis class ships."
4.4	Sail Date: Jun 24, 2018 /	There was always something to do. excursions were awesome. The Bahamas at port were a little disorganized. For early excursion the buffet was the only thing opened and not really much gluten free options at breakfast. Main dining room didn't open early enough. Went thru guest services and main dining room and they worked with us to bring something to buffet. They were awesome. The floor rider staff were very awesome and helpful with my grandson with autism. He couldn't ride it enough. Loved it.
4.3	Sail Date: Jun 24, 2018 /	Ship is in excellent condition. Only saw one maintenance issue that was being handled immediately. Solarium Spa pool could be in nicer condition. Room in great condition. Staff were all very friendly and attentive.
4.2	Sail Date: Jun 24, 2018 /	Main dining and room service was terrible.  No attention to detail, and bad food.  Service was poor and disappointing.  Specialty resturants were very good as was the service.  Ship was full but designed well and good staff that never really felt crowded except near the pools.  Room was great as was the stateroom attendant.
4.1	Sail Date: Jun 24, 2018 /	We really had a great time aboard the Oasis of the Seas!  From entertainment we enjoyed most the art auction.  The specialty restaurants were our favorite.  Great service by there staff memebers.
4.5	Sail Date: Jun 17, 2018 /	Had a fab time, very fun 4 my 5yr old granddaughter, there were characters from DreamWorks, very beautiful ship.
3.8	Sail Date: Jun 17, 2018 /	Overall I wasn't impressed with the Oasis of the Seas. It is one of the largest ships in the world but it lacks the wow factor when it comes to the entertainment and onboard activities. The ship itself is beautiful. When we walked on, we were amazed and super excited. Once we realized that they didn't have many options of onboard activities the excitement went away. The port calls were okay. Haiti was a beach trip. Once you made it through the annoying locals, it was nice and relaxing. I signed up for the dune buggy excursion in Jamaica. That was a lot of fun. Must do! Cozumel is a shoppers haven. Loved it!! That is where I spent a lot of money. I will return to Jamaica and Cozumel. Not on the Oasis of the Seas though.
4.3	Sail Date: Jun 17, 2018 /	Excellent, except for the street vendors in Cozumel.
5.0	Sail Date: Jun 17, 2018 /	I think I was looking for something negative to say about the ship but honestly cannot.  Although she is the oldest in her fleet it was the greatest cruise that I have taken!!  (Over 20).  Thank you Royal my loyalty now belongs to you!!
3.7	Sail Date: Jun 17, 2018 /	Been on a number of cruises with Royal and this was my first on the Oasis size ship's.  I was really looking forward to the trip but after being on the ship I am really not a fan of these mega ships
4.6	Sail Date: Jun 17, 2018 /	Everything was great. The photo people need to get more organized. They need more staff at the end of the week.
4.8	Sail Date: Jun 17, 2018 /	We had a great time,. The staff was friendly and courteous. My wife refers to it as the best vacation ever.
4.8	Sail Date: Jun 17, 2018 /	we've been on several Royal Caribbean cruises and this was by far our favorite. The ship and the amenities are really top notch.
4.7	Sail Date: Jun 17, 2018 /	I had a wonderful time everything and everyone was great. So much to do, too much to do not enough time. Can’t wait to go again next year on another Oasis Class ship.
3.6	Sail Date: Jun 10, 2018 /	I was a first timer. The hype from my sister traveling with me did not meet expectations. She said this wasn’t her normal dream vacation either.
3.6	Sail Date: Jun 10, 2018 /	I had a blast with the group I went with. The lady who cleaned our room twice a day was awesome. She took such pride in her work and was so kind to us. The ship is grand and it is beautiful and was exciting to see it. Just need to realize when you are on a ship that big lines will be long. That was hard for me cause I felt like I was wasting time.
4.9	Sail Date: Jun 10, 2018 /	This was a great cruise, there were a lot of people on this ship but everything was spaced out so it didn't seem crowed at all.
4.3	Sail Date: Jun 03, 2018 /	We had a wonderful time.  Wish there were more activities on deck by the pools. It was a lit th level low key for me and my friends.
4.8	Sail Date: Jun 03, 2018 /	Really big ship which caused some crowding during the evening parties but really good music and fun.  Pools were also very crowded but we ended up going to the Solarium and it was less crowded.  If you don't care about going ashore, that is the time to really enjoy all the boat has to offer without the huge crowds.  We had a fantastic time and would recommend this cruise to anyone.
4.0	Sail Date: Jun 03, 2018 /	Overall the cruise was good. A cruise is what you make it.
3.8	Sail Date: Jun 03, 2018 /	Very relaxing week. You are waited on by some wonderful people. One thing I'd change is not going to three ports in a row.
4.5	Sail Date: Jun 03, 2018 /	The itinerary was great.  This is a big ship, and you have to wait for pretty much everything since there are 6000 people. The shows fill up, the dinner reservations fill up, and the excursions were mostly full by day 1.  But it was a nice ship and we still had a great time.
5.0	Sail Date: Jun 03, 2018 /	Our dining experience was the best memory of the whole cruise. Our Server Erin Anne and Assistant Server Imade were the best. Polite, courteous, humorous, and informative. They exceeded our every expectation. They are awesome.
4.9	Sail Date: May 27, 2018 /	A vacation that you did not have to worry about the safety of your family while on the cruise. Plenty of things to do for the whole family. Family friendly and even though there were smoking and drinking areas you did not feel like it took over the non drinking areas and entertainment
3.7	Sail Date: May 27, 2018 /	I have been waiting all year to take this cruise.  We didn't schedule excursions because the weather was very iffy.  Overall, it was a disappointment.  The ship is beautiful, but there are not enough activities for 6500 people.  My daughter had several less than satisfactory interactions with customer service.  Our wait staff was excellent, but the food was just ok.  Our cabin steward was excellent.
4.8	Sail Date: May 27, 2018 /	It was truly an amazing cruise experience. You will love this ship! It was so big that we never experienced crowds. Entertainment was excellent as was the food and all the service staff! Wonderful vacation! You will not be disappointed!
5.0	Sail Date: May 27, 2018 /	Todo estuvo excelente.  El servicio y el personal son excepcionales.  La comida muy buena.  Siempre he viajado con Royal Caribbean y no me quejo de nada.
3.5	Sail Date: May 27, 2018 /	There was a lot of good things about the cruise but also some negative things as well.  Our Room steward, Pio was AMAZING!  He was probably the nicest guy on the ship.  Some of the other staff acted like they really hated their job which made it very disappointing to deal with.  The food was okay but to get better options you have to pay extra and I think I paid enough for the trip that I'm not paying a ton extra for food when there are free options.  The ship had some neat things that most other ships do not have but there was just way too many people on there at some points.   I'm not really sure I will ever go with Royal Caribbean again.  I believe i would actually prefer Carnival for now on!
5.0	Sail Date: May 27, 2018 /	Amazing getaway for me and my wife. This has definitely set the standard for cruising for us!
4.5	Sail Date: May 20, 2018 /	Luggage was soaking wet in terminal as we disembarked.
4.2	Sail Date: May 20, 2018 /	I wish that the ship would have stayed in San Juan longer than they did. Also the food in the windjammer could have had more Mexican and the breakfast could have been hot.  I’m also glad the ship is going into dry dock because it is a nice ship just need more of the modern things, like slides, imax theatre and more entertainment.
4.7	Sail Date: May 20, 2018 /	Went with 11'members out our family.  We basically went for the company.  Spent time with all of them, singly and all together.   Like I said before - PEOPLE make the cruise!!!!!!!
5.0	Sail Date: May 06, 2018 /	This was my 2nd cruise both were with Royal Carribian and i promise you i Love every moment of them the ships are A1, service was Great, Food was Great  and Entertaiment was Great. My Vacations from the first cruise on out will be with Royal Carribian on the Sea.
5.0	Sail Date: May 06, 2018 /	"The ship is fun to be on and we appreciated the savings we received by booking our next cruise on the ship. 
I would like to see more clocks available in the Solarium and around the ship- it is often hard to keep track of the time when you don't wear a watch for sunning and swimming."
4.9	Sail Date: May 06, 2018 /	Swimming with the dolphins was awesome and Loved Salsa, Salsa, Margarita.
4.8	Sail Date: May 06, 2018 /	Trip was fantastic.  The port of calls were easily accessible and enjoyable.
4.0	Sail Date: May 06, 2018 /	The overall experience was really good; rained a couple of days but there were still things to do.
3.9	Sail Date: Apr 29, 2018 /	"This was our first time on an Oasis class and we went with hesitation hearing about long lines and it being overcrowded. We actually found only the buffet to be overcrowded, and sometimes the promenade; otherwise it was amazing and you had more space than on most ships. This ship is truly amazing and is worth going on. 
AVOID: the buffet
DO: Get internet prior to boarding; Get the three upscale restaurant package - $20/pp per dinner- a great deal! 
RECOMMEND: If you are getting a balcony; consider a Jr. Suite; Balcony rooms are on the small side."
3.6	Sail Date: Apr 29, 2018 /	Did not enjoy cruise as much as we enjoyed inaugural cruise. This time we never got off the ship.  While on the ship we never did anything.  My husband was always too cold and didn't want to participate in anything.  It was probably because of his age, 94.  He had an electric scooter so it was a little challenging for him to get around especially since there were quite a few children on board.
3.0	Sail Date: Apr 29, 2018 /	Workers where very rude at Port Canaveral , Very disappointed with design of the ship . Cabin was too small and ac wasn't cold enough , drink prices where too high . Food was terrible in the Grande dining room and manager was very rude . A piece of my luggage was damaged by baggage claim in Port Canaveral and delivered to the wrong room and delivered to the wrong area upon disembarking in Port Canaveral
5.0	Sail Date: Apr 29, 2018 /	We rented a clamshell in Labadee and it was well worth it.  The bay area has calmer seas and is better for families with children.  Food options were more limited than those options on the ship as expected.  Food is catered from the ship and is included.
3.7	Sail Date: Apr 22, 2018 /	There were a lot of children and activities for them. Specialty restaurants were great. The regular dining restaurant was a little chaotic. But with that many people, it was expected. Book your shows ahead of time or you won't get in. Casino was the same as it is on all cruise ships. After the first day, don't play slots. You will not win. Be careful of the card dealers. They deal so fast that sometimes they take your winning hand away. This was my 76th cruise.
4.8	Sail Date: Apr 15, 2018 /	Just a wonderful experience.  This was our second cruise, and it's simply a true vacation - no worries, just relaxation and fun.  My husband and I do like dressing up a bit more for dinner, so that is a plus for us.
4.6	Sail Date: Apr 15, 2018 /	we loved it it was our first and enjoy it we are already wanting to take another cruise and take our daughter and granddaughter.the staff there was friendly and it was good places.the only thing i would say is need to have the soft drink machines in more places it wasnt that many.other then that my cruise was amazing.
3.7	Sail Date: Apr 08, 2018 /	"Service in several of the bars was terrible.... only one bartender and one (if any) server -- horrible service!!

Ship is beautiful -- shopping is great -- service in stores is fantastic!  Great just to walk around.  Many times it's hard to believe that you're actually on a ship."
3.3	Sail Date: Apr 08, 2018 /	Please see above.  My travel agent was amazing and I would not hesitate to use her again!
5.0	Sail Date: Apr 08, 2018 /	We want to do this all over again!   Thank you Oasis!
4.2	Sail Date: Mar 25, 2018 /	It is annoying how RCCI saves seats for the top cruisers in the theater, studio B and the aqua show and has a special kitchen and dining room for the suites.  There's a feeling that we who chose not to cruise so often on Royal Caribbean are second class cruisers.  Other cruise lines gives suites special dining, but it’s not so overt.  I prefer free internet and free laundry to having seats saved for entertainment events.  It appears that making more money is more of a priority than giving cruisers a great vacation.  I am still annoyed that you don't give shipboard credit for RCCI stockholders.  RCCI always says I booked it under a certain code and it's not eligible for stockholders' shipboard credit.   Princess and Holland America have never refused us stockholders' shipboard credit and Princess gives us military shipboard credit also.  Would it really hurt your bottom line that much to give $100 shipboard credit to a stockholder?  The ill will it causes is far more damaging that the $100.
5.0	Sail Date: Mar 25, 2018 /	This trip was awesome.  Oasis of the Seas is unbelievable.  There is so much to do and so many choices of places to eat.
4.5	Sail Date: Mar 25, 2018 /	The cruse was just what I needed. Very relaxing. The staff was great and knowledgeable. Looking forward to another cruse in the future. Royal Caribian is great.
4.8	Sail Date: Mar 18, 2018 /	Wonderful cruise.   Great food.   Great shoes.   Great hulottubs.
4.5	Sail Date: Mar 18, 2018 /	It was a great cruise for the whole family. The kids had so much to do and gave the adults some nice relaxing time.
4.8	Sail Date: Mar 18, 2018 /	We had a great time.  Crew and staff went out of their way for us. Specialty restaurants were excellent. Can't wait to go again.
4.6	Sail Date: Mar 18, 2018 /	This was only our fifth cruise and first on Royal Caribbean, but the best so far.  The skepticism of going on such a large ship with over 8,000 passengers and crew was unfounded.  The Oasis is very well laid out with several distinct neighborhoods to spread the passengers out.  The service everywhere was also not compromised.  Labadee is the best private beach facility of the three that I have experienced.  Highly recommend this ship and cruise.
4.9	Sail Date: Mar 18, 2018 /	We have done this itinerary several times on the different cruises and enjoy going to Jamaica and learn more about Haiti every time we go. We do not go into Cozumel any more due to the travel warning we have stateside for Mexico but the ship does offer many excursions. It is just our preference. There are places to shop and eat close to the dock that we feel safe going to. Just be aware of what is going on. You are in foreign countries. Each one does it's best I believe to protect tourists as this is a big deal financially for them. Have fun and be safe.
4.3	Sail Date: Mar 11, 2018 /	You Won't be seeing us anytime soon.  It's back to Norwegian and their smaller, less crowded, ships.
4.5	Sail Date: Mar 11, 2018 /	Overall this is one of the best cruises we have been on and definitely the best ship. We usually chose our cruise based on destination as we enjoy exploring the different cultures but this time we chose by ship.  We were not disappointed.  The Oasis is all it is cracked up to be! Cant wait to try another one of the new ships!
4.8	Sail Date: Feb 25, 2018 /	I would definitely go again, might try a different ship next time to see different features.  Last time on this ship, I never felt any movement and at the same time of year.  This cruise,  there was a lot of rocking and wind, guess we went thru more weather systems this time.
4.4	Sail Date: Feb 18, 2018 /	This was one of the better cruises we have experienced recently.  We enjoyed the Central Park, the different venues for having breakfast and lunch.  I thought the drinks were quite expensive (even the daily special was $8) but the bartenders and waiters were very friendly.  We loved the shows but wish there had been more music in the bars and lounges.  We enjoyed it enough that we are cruising on Oasis again in October!
4.5	Sail Date: Feb 18, 2018 /	Fantastic ship! Revamp the food at Sabor and get professional musicians.
3.5	Sail Date: Feb 11, 2018 /	For years I had been looking forward to sailing on the Oasis of the Seas, but I think I'll stick with the Voyager-class and Freedom-class ships going forward based on employee:guest ratio and overall value provided.
3.6	Sail Date: Feb 11, 2018 /	The Oasis is a beautiful ship but did not have enough space for the amount of people on board. All the theaters, bars, restaurant, pools, shops we're too small for the amount of people on the ship. I will not go back on an Oasis class ships. In the words of my 11 year old the Oasis of the seas is a bigger but smaller ship when compared to Liberty of the Seas. We learned our lesson bigger isn't always better. Next time we will stay with the freedom class ships!
4.9	Sail Date: Feb 11, 2018 /	"Come prepared to eat, drink and be merry on this Oasis in the sea.  Tip: run or walk the track around deck 5 for some nice quiet time, exercise and at night great views of the Stars off the back of the ship.
Just enjoy all this ship has to offer."
4.1	Sail Date: Feb 04, 2018 /	Great ship, plenty to do. When you were in certain areas such as the shops, central park etc you forgot you were on a ship. It was as if you were on a shopping trip with family.
4.2	Sail Date: Jan 28, 2018 /	Overall a good experience but would have been greater with some better planning by RC.
3.7	Sail Date: Jan 21, 2018 /	"Was nice to experience a ship of this size but the comments we have make are very real
So we have decided to stay with Carnival Cruiselines ."
4.7	Sail Date: Jan 21, 2018 /	Loved this cruise, would definitely return to Rayol Caribbean cruise line. Oasis was fantastic.
5.0	Sail Date: Jan 21, 2018 /	Great experience. Will recommend. Bring money. Have fun. Go in a big group!
3.9	Sail Date: Jan 21, 2018 /	would have been nice to know there was a jewish ordeal going on it was awful they way they treat everyone and i felt like RC gave them fist service
4.2	Sail Date: Jan 14, 2018 /	In summary I loved the cruise.  The ship is awesome, the food is great if you are good at planning where you eat.  The drink and internet package is a must.  If you are cost conscience stay out of the casino (duh).  The stops at St. Maarten, San Juan, and Labadee are weak at best, but the ship itself more than makes up for it.  Next time I would love to cruise on the Oasis or any of her sister ships but I will be doing it to on a different itinerary.
4.7	Sail Date: Jan 14, 2018 /	Nice relaxing week. Lots to do. Lots of walking, the ship is huge!
5.0	Sail Date: Jan 07, 2018 /	The cruise was very good when  is setting up excursions for the cruise they need to be linked to Royal Caribbean some way that was the only issue we had
3.9	Sail Date: Jan 07, 2018 /	ship in need of minor repairs and upkeep...felt nickled and dimed ie charge for popcorn at movies and charge for floating mat on private island and for slide and roller coaster ride..charges alittle on the high side

4.3	Sail Date: Jan 07, 2018 /	Great time!  With drink, net and dinning packages.  All were with it except maybe the dinning package
4.7	Sail Date: Jan 07, 2018 /	Enjoyed the crusie. Met lots of people. Lots of activities to do.
4.7	Sail Date: Jan 07, 2018 /	Even though the ship is very large we were able to find a great place to hang out from morning until night in the Central Park area.  There is a little cafe (included) and a lot of the specialty dining/bars.  Frankly Central Park was the most pleasant addition to a cruise ship that I've seen.  And even though there were 5000 passengers it never felt crowded!  Overall a very good ship, great staff and service.  Highly recommend trying it at least once.

4.2	Sail Date: Jan 07, 2018 /	Cruise was great met all my expectations and then some.
4.1	Sail Date: Dec 24, 2017 /	"Our experience on the Oasis of the Seas was mixed.  There were many things we enjoyed a great deal, and some things that were not up to par.  To set the background for our review, we want to note that this was our 5th cruise on Royal Caribbean, and our 16th cruise overall.  We have cruised over the Christmas/New Years holidays for the past 13 years.  We have a good deal of experience with cruising at this time of the year and with multiple cruise lines.  

We booked a two device Internet package for the Oasis, because we anticipated having to do a little work over the holiday break.  This is the first time we purchased Internet access on a cruise ship.  We really enjoyed it.  The Voom service on the Oasis was much better than we expected.  We would definitely purchase this again.

Please read the details posted in the specific categories to get our perspectives on our overall experience on the Oasis."
4.7	Sail Date: Dec 17, 2017 /	If you would like to try a large ship Oasis of the Seas is a GREAT time!

3.6	Sail Date: Dec 17, 2017 /	Dislike all the advanced eservations, else I get treated like 3rd class Citizen.  Too many classes on the ship with privileges.  Going back to Carnival from now on.
4.8	Sail Date: Dec 17, 2017 /	We had a great time.  Service was fantastic as a whole.
2.9	Sail Date: Dec 17, 2017 /	Poor service and cleanliness in comparison to smaller Royal Caribbean ships. Done with Royal Caribbean.
4.3	Sail Date: Dec 10, 2017 /	Great time, looking forward to next cruise.  We will most likely select another cruise line due to our vacation location.  We would like to go to Hawaii.  Royal Carribean has limited cruises to that location.
3.9	Sail Date: Dec 10, 2017 /	This was the first time on the Oasis. We will be back.
4.3	Sail Date: Dec 10, 2017 /	Was surprised and how delightful the big ship was!
4.5	Sail Date: Dec 10, 2017 /	We loved the ship and had a great time ..would go on Oasis again..  We wish they had a venue where they played 50s and 60s music for us old timers. There were a lot of us on the cruise...
4.4	Sail Date: Dec 10, 2017 /	This was our second trip on the Oasis - first with our kids (8&10.)  Royal Caribbean does not disappoint.   There is so much to do on the ship we were never bored.  We got a bit unlucky with choppy seas the first few days and a little colder weather than normal -- but in the end it is all what you make of it!  Kids still had a blast and hubby and I are already planning our next family cruise on RC!
4.9	Sail Date: Dec 03, 2017 /	It was an unforgettable vacation on the ship.The entire staff is trained perfectly to take guests.Beautiful interiors throughout the ship.I recommend everyone to rela[ on this fabulous ship Oasis.
3.7	Sail Date: Dec 03, 2017 /	"Royal Caribbean has to please as many people as they can and this is a delicate subject for the fact that many people do not control their children and expect to go about their annoying ways. There should be a ""family"" section for the formal dinning area. Nobody wants to hear a screaming kid and put up with food being thrown at them. Try to imagine at a great meal with some fine wine and then a family with small uncontrolled children sets down at the table next to you and makes your dream become a nightmare. Not happy with this and I paid good money to relax and enjoy myself. Many others had the same problem. Discussed this with many people while waiting in line. Rethinking cruise line to one that caters to adults. Royal Caribbean should consider this as most of the higher paying passengers are older repeat cruisers that opt for many premium services. Not once every 5 year families on a budget. On the other hand, ship is very large and is well built for comfort and imperceptible movement at high speeds."
3.1	Sail Date: Dec 03, 2017 /	Just wish the cruise ship didn't rush to get to the islands that were hit with the hurricane because they are definitely not ready for tourist the only reason i cruise is for the islands unfortunate this trip was not worth it and I spent a lot of money and was not happy.  This boat was also to big more me.  A lot of waiting in lines.  I think I will stick with Carnival!!
4.8	Sail Date: Nov 26, 2017 /	Great vacation overall! I would not necessarily go to Falmouth, Jamaica again. It was not a favorite of mine or our traveling friends. Cozumel was wonderful and Labadee was a nice beach break.
4.5	Sail Date: Nov 26, 2017 /	Despite the massive size of this ship (over 6000 passengers) I never felt overly crowed and there were plenty of activities.  Wen enjoyed the shows and entertainment options in various bars/venues throughout the ship.  Overall I thought the ship was wonderful
3.9	Sail Date: Nov 26, 2017 /	Royal Caribbean has always been one of my two favorite cruise lines.  I was disappointed this time.  So many things have changed since my last Royal cruise.  Prices had gone up so much.  Dining room service was great, but food was only fair.  Choices were not good - for example, not much choice in salads and soups.  At the end of the week, we said the best meal we had all week was at Johnny Rockets.  Going through the book on off ship tours, there was only one for a handicapper person.  Crew was amazing
4.9	Sail Date: Nov 26, 2017 /	We've been on RCL half a dozen times and it has become our favorite cruise line.  Beautiful ships and great people. And a great way to spend a week unwinding and relaxing.
3.1	Sail Date: Nov 26, 2017 /	I am not sure that the added cost for Royal over other cruise line is really worth it with the service levels not being at a higher standard as it used to be.  Cutting cost may have lost them the edge.  We did not book our next cruise on board as we usually do, because we want to compare with other options.  Maybe the bigger the ship is not always the better ship...
3.4	Sail Date: Nov 26, 2017 /	Captain and all crew were Fabulous and the service from the crew was awesome but there is way to much smoke in the casino and to many drunk people out of control, Also MOLD in and around our cabin
3.6	Sail Date: Nov 26, 2017 /	very stressful, besides the waiters and room Stuart we did not have a very good experience.  We will not go the  Oasis of the Seas ever again.  I found something in my cake, dirty coffee cups, hair in my towels,  Rude guest services, rude Royal Caribbean staff outside a show, horrible start to our cruise getting a wheel chair, same food over and over again.
4.5	Sail Date: Nov 19, 2017 /	Overall this was a fantastic experience for our first cruise and definitely one we would recommend and do ourselves again.  Only negatives or areas for improvement:   the main dining room food taste could be improved (especially desserts) and our specific NEXT cruise representative was not helpful at all when we wanted to book our next cruise - possible training issue?  he was not knowledgeable at all about the cruise options nor explaining any discounts available.  We left not booking one due to our frustration with this.
4.7	Sail Date: Nov 19, 2017 /	"I 😍 loved it, SILK WAS THE BEST, Anton and Omar went over and beyond for us.
But I hated Falmouth the people are rude they don’t care about the customers"
3.8	Sail Date: Nov 19, 2017 /	It was ok. Would not recommend Oasis of the Seas. Ship catered to children. They were aloud in bars, sitting at the bars. They were aloud in dance areas screaming and yelling at 11pm. Solarium allows 16 year olds in adult section. Not a good experience.
4.7	Sail Date: Nov 12, 2017 /	"We were treated like Royalty from start to finish, We got to meet so many fun and interesting people, as the tee shirt says ... Tans fade but memories last forever!  Thanks for the Memories Royal Caribbean ! 
Hope to see you again soon !"
4.2	Sail Date: Nov 12, 2017 /	Love cruising!! Royal is one of my favorite cruise lines. we have been on 18....14 being royal. The ports were not my first choice but due to the Hurricane  they were ok. The oasis is a beautiful ship..one of our favorites!!
4.8	Sail Date: Nov 05, 2017 /	The Oasis of the Seas is a fabulous ship that will exceed your expectations!  The ship has tons of activities.  There are children's activities for all ages.  The ship has a variety of shows to enjoy as well as food.  There is so much to do you should not get bored.
4.4	Sail Date: Nov 05, 2017 /	The Oasis offers plenty of activities and restaurants both included and not included in the price. There's something for everyone. The entertainment is top notch too. I highly recommend this ship and cruise line.
2.9	Sail Date: Nov 05, 2017 /	I was very unhappy with them sending us to Mexico .   Mexico was nothing to look at.  Unless you wanted to shop you might as well stay on ship    I would not recommend this at all.
5.0	Sail Date: Oct 29, 2017 /	"THIS WAS A CRUISE OF A LIFETIME!! IT WAS THE LARGEST OF ALL THE SHIP I HAVE BEEN ON. IT HAS SOMETHING FOR ALL AGES TO SEE AND DO!! THERE WAS SO MANY DIFFERENT SHOWS AND WE ENJOYED THEM ALL!! WELL DONE ROYAL CARIBBEAN!! 

THANK YOU FOR A GREAT CRUISE!!"
3.9	Sail Date: Oct 22, 2017 /	The Oasis is a beautiful ship and excellent for retirees etc. We were not overly impressed with the available entertainment or activities for our age group. You should also advertise weight limits and necessary attire for on board activities ON YOUR WEBSITE so that we don't find out AFTER we spend all of the money and get on the ship, only to realize we can't use half of the things you offer.
3.2	Sail Date: Oct 22, 2017 /	Would not sail on this ship again people didn't seem to like there jobs. Not good entertainment. Very crowded. The cruise director was no fun at all you barely seen him! I have cruised RC many of times on other ships liked the people on them better. Better shows and things to do. People seemed to go out of there way for you, not on the Oasis!! Never again!!
4.5	Sail Date: Oct 22, 2017 /	"Great criuise for our 40th Anniversary.  The ship was great with the meals, service staff were awesome and shows were really good with the exception of CATS being to long to hold our attention.  I am sure some enjoyed it.  The group of six from CATS and Wilds and James filling in for Come Fly with me were great.  The six singing with the orchestra could be a act on their own.

Did not like the smell my clothes, seemed to be he cotton, got in the room of sour milk.  Being disabled and using my scooter was great but getting locked out of our room and waiting in the hall with all the luggage was not good."
4.7	Sail Date: Oct 22, 2017 /	Great experience. Food, service and shows were all amazing. Loved the Oasis of the Seas.  Would definitely sail on her again. Easy to learn your way around the ship and really never felt crowded.
4.7	Sail Date: Oct 22, 2017 /	"Items/times on daily schedule not alwsys accurate. Indicated Jonny Rockets not open for breakfast- it was.
Some small venues were standing room only. Not sure why a larger facility was not used.
Boat was the nicest I've ever been on (Over 30 cruises).
Shows had AMAZING singers and dancers"
3.8	Sail Date: Oct 15, 2017 /	We thoroughly enjoyed our cruise.  There were things that needed attention, but nothing that over shadowed our enjoyment.  The Cruise Director's Morning Rant was great.  He provided secret tips and ideas needed for the Day.  I liked the Captain's Morning review as well.  Made us feel part of the crew!
4.7	Sail Date: Oct 15, 2017 /	Great Experiences on ship and ports of call. Oasis of the Seas wonderful ship, great staff and customer service. Will definitely sail with Royal Caribbean again in the future.
4.6	Sail Date: Oct 15, 2017 /	The Oasis of the Seas ship was absolutely wonderful.  From the experience dropping our bags off for room delivery, to leaving the ship with a small tear on disembarkation, it was an experience to remember and we both said we would love to visit this beautiful vessel again soon!
4.7	Sail Date: Oct 15, 2017 /	"Pleasant and friendly,  Only complaint was that the bacon was no drained and unhealthy.  
we cruise every 3-4 months on the Oasis and the entertainment does not change. I enjoyed the Freedom with their entertainers and different shows."
4.8	Sail Date: Oct 15, 2017 /	We selected this cruise for the ship.  It was well worth the wait and excitement.  So much to do and all done very nicely.  We have already booked a cruise on a sister-ship since we enjoyed it so much.
5.0	Sail Date: Oct 15, 2017 /	the cruise was very relaxing and the ship was a pleasure to go through and explore.  Everything on the ship was so enjoyable to see.  Central Park is beautiful and very relaxing, then you step onto the Boardwalk and become a kid again then comes the shows and you feel like you're on Broadway.
3.1	Sail Date: Oct 08, 2017 /	Overwhelming and tiring due to the many policies, reservations, liberal children's policy. Make sure that you are aware of the many requirements, stipulations and policies that the ship has prior to booking a vacation to minimize disappointment. We did not see where they were posted prior to our booking on this ship and we certainly did not imagine that they would have such a liberal policy regarding children. Lack of communication
4.4	Sail Date: Oct 08, 2017 /	Can't wait to go back on another one!  We were disappointed that Labadee was taken off our route, we understood obviously on the other ports but Costa Maya was a disappointment.
4.2	Sail Date: Oct 08, 2017 /	Had a wonderful week. The seas were very smooth. Our artist Henry got change due to the hurricanes so the ports we went to were not our first choice but we were blessed to be able to be on a cruise and not suffering like those in Puerto Rico and Saint Maarten. The ship was huge and very clean. Our boardwalk balcony was very nice and I would recommend it. The ship did not seem crowded at all with as many people on it. We never had a problem finding a lounge chair . The food in the main dining room was good not outstanding. We did eat at chops one night and I wouldn’t say it was the best steak I’ve ever had. A room attendant was amazing as well as our waiter an assistant leader. I would definitely go on the ship again !
4.6	Sail Date: Oct 08, 2017 /	This was 2nd cruise but 1st time w/Royal Caribbean.  We are def booking another cruise and big ship next time.  Oasis of the Seas was a true beauty. Royal Caribbean is def doing it big with these new big ships.  Not sure how they do it, and how they manage to get everything so organized. We traveled with our kids and they loved the ship too. We also purchased the drink pkg w/Voom internet! Def a plus!! We booked our excursions on our own, and had a great time!
4.0	Sail Date: Oct 01, 2017 /	Reroute was awful. 6200 people should not lose a day because of one person. We should have been given compensation.  We also didn't go to Cozumel because of weather. We should have stopped elsewhere.
2.6	Sail Date: Oct 01, 2017 /	Ship  is amazing but way too crowded especially in the pool areas. Food at complimentary venues was not very good. Specialty restaurants were over priced and with the exception of the Italian place, were not impressive.
3.7	Sail Date: Oct 01, 2017 /	Disappointed that one port was cancelled.  5 days at sea was a little much.  Royal Caribbean attempted to schedule another port but was unsuccessful.  With all the days at sea, the itinerary seemed to be very confusion for everyone including the staff.
2.8	Sail Date: Oct 01, 2017 /	80% disaster, would never do it again even if I was paid.  We were looking for a fun family vacation to bond together with shared family memories through fun activities and there was very little that my entire family could do together within the sleep schedule kids naturally require.  The needs of the young children were more than difficult to fulfill with the many restrictions and lack of proper accomodations.  The trip was exhausting because of how complicated the ships many different schedules, rules, hidden rules, regulations, physical restrictions, waivers, lines, lines, and more lines.  There were blockages for a wheel chair or stroller everywhere we went which slowed us down horribly.  With how many lawn chairs and cleaning carts we had to move, we should have worked for the boat.  Everything I paid for in advance was either broken or poorly managed with hidden problems like food, drinks, soda, Jamaica excursion timeline and the endless lines and last minute restrictions on 80% of everything we tried.  However if I made a mistake like: want to swim with my toddlers from 7-9pm or in the same place as my other children, do an activity or show with all 6 of us without waiting 60+ minutes, turn my towel into housekeeping instead of on the pool deck at two specific places, keep alcoholic beverages away from my kids at the pool and hot tub, get help at guest services before waiting 40 min in line, find a place outside our room all four kids could play together for 30 minutes that didnt require 100% of my attention to keep them from violating ANOTHER silly rule or running into alcohol or tobacco use, find 2 diapers the last evening of the trip (I actually had to beg random parents to get 2 diapers, done at the request of guest services, and shop keepers), get my stroller with two sleeping babies through the hall to my room, get help learning how the ship works and where to go for what my family needs, let my 3 year old who is professionally trained at rock climbing, climb with her brothers, checking babies and toddlers in and out of child care in under 40 minutes, Then I was treated strictly and unforgivingly and turned away.  It was more than frustrating, and overwhelming trying to care for the basic needs of my family which made it very difficult to have fun.  The ship is not for families because it is unforgiving, and unaccomodating to the basic nerds of little ones. 7 different families complained to me about there concerns as well when they struggled with the same concerns I did.  The ship is Unacceptable for families 80% of the time and I was extreemly disappointed is how I would describe this experience.  While on the ship, I felt more like I was cattle being herded and pushed in the direction they wanted rather than a family on a trip to build lasting memories together.  Of our entire 3 week family vacation in Orlando, including the cruise, the 6 days on the ship were by far the least memory building/ bonding, or fun experience for my family.  Sad because I had wanted to try a cruise since I was young and my hubby and I worked overtime many many weekends to try this cruise but after this experience I have absolutely no desire to go on another cruise ever again.  The kids liked the endless pizza and ice cream they could have had if I had let them have more than 3 ice cream cones or pizza slices a day.  We paid for surf lessons which were really fun and went as described and expected, the zip line, pool, and minigolf were great for my hubby and older kids.  The toddlers enjoyed the ever after on ice, glass elevators, and the carousel.  The rest had potential to be fun but was thwarted by rules, restrictions, and lines.  Wish I would have known in advance this cruise is not for families with young children they want to spend time with, not drop at child care or split apart 80% of the time.
4.3	Sail Date: Sep 24, 2017 /	Cruise itinerary was changed from Eastern to Western Caribbean due to hurricanes without any compensation, would never have booked the cruise with these ports of call.  There were more guests out on the ship at 6am for coffee than at 10pm for the nightlife.  Some of the staff was great but more were generally neutral on their attitude.  Plan on spending money for lunch and dinner if you want options for food.
4.7	Sail Date: Sep 24, 2017 /	Ship was great but ports were no where near what we wanted. We paid for better islands and disappointed we didn’t get some sort of refund or any furture booking discount.
4.4	Sail Date: Sep 24, 2017 /	We had a very good time. Always enjoy Royal Caribbean as they treat you well and it is a good mix for older and younger cruisers. Stay up late if you want or get up early and enjoy. One or both and you make it a great time.
4.8	Sail Date: Sep 17, 2017 /	This was my first time cruising and we loved it. The ship was amazing, the service as well, I loved the islands , the tours. The restaurant American Icon was 5 stars for us, we sat in the table 279 where Jose and Jasuli treat us so good every day, they are amazing. The food was so delicious as well....👍👍👍👍
4.8	Sail Date: Sep 17, 2017 /	This is my sixth overall, first with Royal Caribbean and it won't be my last with them.  This is the best one I've been on, and they were outstanding.
4.3	Sail Date: Sep 17, 2017 /	Typical RCL cruise experience... These folks know how to treat their cruise customers. I just wish the designers would have kept the Freedom ship fitness center design. To be able to look forward during your exercising is missed.
4.5	Sail Date: Sep 17, 2017 /	Nice so.  Was annoyed with people coming to my tables and breakfast and dinner asking is to upgrade dinner to a better restaurant, of to go to a wine testing.   Almost felt harassed.
4.4	Sail Date: Sep 17, 2017 /	great smooth sailing,we love that cruise experience and will highly recommend to book that oasis of the sea cruise to other people.Excellent services were provided
2.7	Sail Date: Sep 17, 2017 /	This was my 7th cruise.  My third on Royal Caribbean and I was somewhat disappointed.   The food was horrible.  The activities were few and far between.  When you got to an activity the venue was too small and could not accommodate all those that wanted to participate.  I did not enjoy the activities director at all.  He did not seem to have his heart in his job.  A bit cocky for my liking.
4.7	Sail Date: Sep 17, 2017 /	The trip was great!  Captain did a wonderful job avoid all bad weather to ensure every day at sea was sunny and clear. Best cruise I have ever taken.  I will cruise on this ship again in the future.
3.5	Sail Date: Sep 03, 2017 /	"We are experienced cruisers and have been to most of the Caribbean Islands multiple times. These days we cruise based on particular lines and specific ships. With this in mind I would say we enjoyed our voyage on this beautiful ship. My wife lives by the pool and I find a comfortable quiet place to read and watch videos. This ship made us both happy. The fact that were ""stuck"" at sea f04 3 extra days because of the hurricane made it a unique experience. It was amazing to watch the crew handle this difficult situation and make us comfortable and entertained."
4.5	Sail Date: Sep 03, 2017 /	The captain, the cruise director, the entertainment, the staff...  all wonderful!  Would go on Oasis again and again!  The ports were all great, beside the people begging for you to come in their shops!
3.7	Sail Date: Sep 03, 2017 /	not my class of ship due to being to big and the simple things not included in price that i am use to getting on the Freedom class. this is filler to meet the minimum charactres
5.0	Sail Date: Sep 03, 2017 /	Royal Caribbean did a great job even during hurricane Irma to make sure that we were comfortable and having a great time. Our cruise was extended by 3 nights at no fault of the cruise line. They cut drink prices and provided additional entertainment at no cost. I'll be Loyal to Royal due to this excellent service!!!
4.6	Sail Date: Sep 03, 2017 /	Would go again in a heartbeat. Love royal Caribbean, Oasis is amazing. There's lots to do and it doesn't feel crowded even with more than 6000 passengers.
5.0	Sail Date: Sep 03, 2017 /	The captain and crew went above and beyond.  We were delayed 3 days because of the hurricane.  The captain updated us and kept us very informed about the situation.  We were never afraid because we were in such good hands.  The cruise line did not charge us for the three days or for the gratuities.  They brought in more performers for shows, stayed and extra day in Cozumel, and went to an extra port Costa Maya.  I can not say enough good things about Royal Caribbean Cruise lines.  They will be my only cruise line.  Plus what I saw on the news when I was home about them going and giving aid to the islands that were affected by the hurricane.  What a GREAT company!!!!
4.8	Sail Date: Sep 03, 2017 /	This cruise took place when hurricane Irma came through. Out cruise was extended 3 additional days. The captain and staff kept everyone well informed (as we were not only concerned with our trip, but our family and home back in Florida).  Royal Caribbean provided discounts on services and waived all fees for any of the additional days at sea. They arranged additional talent to be flown to Cozumel so we didnt have to watch the sames shows. The were just incredible. This was our first trip with Royal... we will be Royal to Loyal from here on out.  .. Did I mention how impressed we were with their humanitarian efforts. This was the icing on the cake. You can tell the company and their staff really care about people.
4.3	Sail Date: Aug 27, 2017 /	was a great cruise - would do it again.  really enjoyed the ship and all its ameneties.  Did not care for the constant bombardment of upcharge services from the staff (specialty dining, drink packages  etc.)
4.1	Sail Date: Aug 27, 2017 /	I always recommend Royal Caribbean. There are lines with better food or better entertainment but RCCL does everything to a particular level of competence so we have never been disappointed.
3.5	Sail Date: Aug 27, 2017 /	You ask if we were celebrating anything and we told you birthday and anniversary but there isn't any communications because it wasn't recognized again (2nd year in a row)
4.5	Sail Date: Aug 27, 2017 /	This trip was definitely worth the money.  The ship was excellent, well-maintained, and spacious; the food was excellent.  I'd do it again in a heartbeat!
4.9	Sail Date: Aug 27, 2017 /	Very, very happy with my experience on the cruise. I would like to do it again in the future. Oasis of the Seas has set my cruise expectations to a new high.
4.9	Sail Date: Aug 27, 2017 /	Out of all cruises this one would be most remembered because of all the wonderful activities, sights  and beautiful things on and of the ship. Your hostility, the staff flare and warm smiles and helping hands made this experience more special.
4.8	Sail Date: Aug 27, 2017 /	It exceeded my expectations.  Will travel on Royal Caribbean again.  Best vacation I have had in a very long time.  People,  food, entertainment were all top notch. No complaints I  wish I  could have stayed another week.
4.9	Sail Date: Aug 27, 2017 /	It was great!  Specialty restaurant staff at chops was rude!  The main dining room was excellent!  Ryan was the best waiter from every cruise i have ever taken.
4.9	Sail Date: Aug 20, 2017 /	Recommend the Oasis to all our family and friends. A definite experience to be enjoy for all ages. The Cruise Director and Activities Director know how to entertain their guests!
4.0	Sail Date: Aug 20, 2017 /	Overall, the cruise was good and I would recommend it.  The ship is very large and most times it was hard to get an elevator in a timely manner.  The best part of the ship is the fabulous gym!
4.3	Sail Date: Aug 20, 2017 /	I had a great time.  This was my second cruise.  The first was with another cruise line, and I was very disappointed.  This cruise was what I expected.  Very relaxing, which was my goal.
4.9	Sail Date: Aug 20, 2017 /	Will cruise with royal Caribbean again they are way better then carnival. Everything is better, food,entertainment, cabin, staff all around better trip. And Bonnie Tyler was the best singing during the Eclipse, I will never forget this trip.
4.5	Sail Date: Aug 20, 2017 /	Enjoyed it very much.  Very friendly and accommodating staff.  The food was good.  I just loved the 150 restaurant.  The meal was a pure delight and the ambience was consummate.  I will definitely visit this restaurant next time.
4.7	Sail Date: Aug 20, 2017 /	The cruise was relaxing & enjoyable & kid friendly.  We enjoyed ourselves. Activities for all to enjoy.  The food was amazing from the buffet to the room service.  The one outstanding highlight was we saw the dollar eclipse from beginning to end on 8/21/17. My children would probably never experience that again.
4.8	Sail Date: Aug 13, 2017 /	Had a wonderful, memorable experience!  Everything was first class.  Only disappointment was how very many amenities are offered for extra charge and not included in the prepaid cruise fees. Seems like they charge for much more than they used to.
3.6	Sail Date: Aug 13, 2017 /	This ship and itenery were ok. Even with the lack of activities I had a good time. As a regular cruiser, RCL will not be my first choice. They seemed to nickel and dime passengers for everything.
4.4	Sail Date: Aug 13, 2017 /	We had an awesome honeymoon. Next time we will bring some friends with us. I don't know  why i have to write so much in order to submit this review. This is the worst part lol.
4.8	Sail Date: Aug 13, 2017 /	This was one of the best vacations we have taken and can't wait to go back! The food, service and locations were perfect fit for our family.  I would highly recommend it to others.
4.7	Sail Date: Aug 13, 2017 /	Only complaint was the muster arrangement.  Grouped us in the blazing hot sun and tormented us with a silly, too long, safety movie.  Everything else was superior.
5.0	Sail Date: Aug 13, 2017 /	Would do it again! The cruise experience from start to finish was the best we ever had. Easy boarding to easy departure. Loved it! The only thing I would change was the weather, it rained at the first 2 ports.
4.8	Sail Date: Aug 13, 2017 /	Overall, my family and I had a wonderful time. The cruise director is full of energy and really gets the crowds going. The ship is absolutely breathtaking. We enjoyed the 70s dance party and the dreamworks parade. The entertainment was great and something for everyone. The sports zone had a lot of activities and we were never bored. Even though, the ship is huge, it's easy to navigate. The staff and crew were friendly.  The food was a hit or miss, but overall we were satisfied with the food options. The Adventure Ocean kids program is wonderful and my youngest never wanted to leave.  I would definitely recommend this ship.
2.7	Sail Date: Aug 13, 2017 /	I will Cruise Carnival again, before I ever dare waste money on Royal Caribbean.  I also never got my free dinner at Johnny Rockets as promised by CruiseOnly.com.
4.8	Sail Date: Aug 06, 2017 /	A great family vacation with our adult children that allowed for pampering and relaxation the whole week! We enjoyed the all inclusive aspect of cruising!
4.6	Sail Date: Aug 06, 2017 /	This was our first cruise experience and it was great. The ship offered many things to do which was great especially during cruising days.  The ship was clean and the staff was very friendly.  We will definitely be using Royal Caribbean for our next cruise.
4.9	Sail Date: Aug 06, 2017 /	This was a great experience. We enjoyed every minute of it. Looking forward to cruising on this ship again soon. The staff was super helpful and hard working. There was always lots to do and after 7 days we still have not seen all of the ship.
4.8	Sail Date: Aug 06, 2017 /	Very impressed with Oasis!!!  Loved everything on the ship....balcony, food/drinks, entertainment, and activities!  All staff was very friendly and the ship was very clean.  Def would do again!!
4.2	Sail Date: Jul 30, 2017 /	"decent cruise - ship is so large ,you really don't feel the water --  the 5th deck -promenade - just like a city street - shops - drinks - food - 6th deck the Board walk - carousel - hot dogs ice cream - aqua  theater -- a ship where it's  a bit difficult to sit and watch the ocean- the 16th deck- Skywalk - plenty of seats  available  - even for sea days - but completely  outside in the sun - so one has to be careful of that
without question best entertainment  - full Broadway production of Cats- had ice show- high wire act - just amazing
Food was  average to good --  But  still a remarkable  vessel"
5.0	Sail Date: Jul 30, 2017 /	From embarkation to disembarkation, this cruise was everything we'd hoped for and more.  The activities, entertainment, and ports of call were excellent.  And the crew members were absolutely magnificent.  Royal Caribbean cruisers are treated like royalty.
4.8	Sail Date: Jul 30, 2017 /	Oasis was an amazing ship! Very clean and not crowded at all for it's size. Lots to do and the shows food were amazing! Pools are a bit small, but no trouble finding chairs
3.9	Sail Date: Jul 23, 2017 /	Overall a very enjoyable cruise. Really enjoyed the ship itself. Could have been better if we were not trying to be sold something every 5 minutes. Night club was a too small for a ship this size. Windjammer cafe was also too small and could get massive lines during breakfast hours.
3.6	Sail Date: Jul 23, 2017 /	Overall a pleasant vacation.  The service was not up to standards of our previous cruises, however.  Very nice ship.  Except for wait times (for elevators, the flow rider, and tables in the buffet), the ship seemed to be able to handle the 6700 passengers.
4.5	Sail Date: Jul 23, 2017 /	We will only cruise with Royal Caribbean.  We've been on one cruise with Carnival and now three with Royal and you can't compare the two.  Even though our experience the first day wasn't the best, with the mix-up with our room, the overall trip experience was great.  The food, service and activities are amazing.  We really enjoyed the Oasis of the Seas ship!  We felt very little motion even in a storm (on the last night).
4.9	Sail Date: Jul 23, 2017 /	I would not hesitate to book another cruise on the Oasis! It was a wonderful experience altogether.  Wish we could get good deals and better/affordable prices.
3.6	Sail Date: Jul 23, 2017 /	I really felt like quantity took priority over quality when it came to food.  Lunch buffets basically the same every day.  Dinner food was nothing like other RCCL cruises I've been on.  Felt it was not gourmet (as you would expect), wasn't even good food - sad to say.  I never looked forward to dinner and that's a shame for a RCCL cruise.  Large ship is you like the feeling of NOT being on a ship!  Plenty of pool space was great!  Wish there would have been some eating space allotted near pools.
4.2	Sail Date: Jul 23, 2017 /	"The ship is huge. Activities galore. I feel like I was in another town and enjoying its downtown amenities. 
Having a deluxe drink package made my cruising a lot ""funner""."
4.8	Sail Date: Jul 16, 2017 /	Loved this cruise and can't wait for me next one. (Not sure why this is requiring a minimum of 150 characters - that's just annoying) xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
4.3	Sail Date: Jul 09, 2017 /	We will cruise with RC again, enjoyed the experience.  Despite a poor rating for the Bahamas, the trip was overall terrific!  Excursion choices were good, the crew was exceptional and the activity options were very good.  We'll be back!
4.9	Sail Date: Jul 09, 2017 /	This was a fabulous cruise, the ship and it's staff were simply amazing. The islands were so beautiful and the water is addicting. We had such a good time.
4.0	Sail Date: Jul 09, 2017 /	Great cruise ,Took my daughter and her husband and 2 grand kids ALL had a great time. 6 year old cried when we left the boat. The character breakfast was a big hit.
5.0	Sail Date: Jul 02, 2017 /	We celebrated our 10th Anniversary during the week of this cruise and it was as wonderful and special as our Honeymoon 10 years prior.  We visited Labadee and the updates were astonishing!
4.8	Sail Date: Jul 02, 2017 /	RC did a phenomenal job.  The Oasis of the Seas is more than a ship.  The trip was more than a vacation.  It truly was a wonderful time.  I highly, highly recommend this boat to anyone.  Take time to plan and do a little extra.  It is worth it...
4.5	Sail Date: Jul 02, 2017 /	Best vacation we have ever had.  We were always treated so well.  Pampered to the max!  The Oasis is an amazing ship, and even though there were 6,350 guests on board, the only time we felt crowded was during certain events on the Promenade.  Cannot wait to go again!
3.3	Sail Date: Jul 02, 2017 /	This is a very large and crowded ship. Many venues are too small to accommodate the volume of passengers (e.g., comedy club, jazz club, etc.). This ship is designed mainly for a few unique outdoor activities (surfing, zip line, rock climbing, aqua theater). Size is not better in this case. The cruise is crowded all the time and the entertainment is completely unremarkable.
5.0	Sail Date: Jun 25, 2017 /	"I would definitely recommend this cruise for families with kids of all ages and for those without kids.   The ship has a lot of people of on it but you really won't notice except for a couple of occasions  1) lots of people in the Promenade for 70's night) 2) waiting on the surfing simulator and 3) breakfast at WIndjammer the first morning.

 

The ship is very well laid out with lots of activities and a very friendly crew.   The internet is pretty fast and we used it primarily to communicate and the kids for surfing on their devices (by us and out in the sun).  The food is pretty good, at least as good as you are going to get when cooking for that many people, and we heard someone talking about the Specialty dining but that was not for us.  Expect at least 1.5 hours for dinner in the main dining areas but we found out we could get food pretty fast if we were late for a show.

 

The back of the boat on the 5th floor is very relaxing as well as the Solarium (much hotter)."
5.0	Sail Date: Jun 25, 2017 /	Great time with family and friends!   Boat was beautiful.  Didn't have enough time to do everything.  Lots of things for all ages to do.  Not a lot for toddlers to do.  Pools were small and split up so kids didn't really like those.  Would be nice if the  boat had a large water slide like some of the other boats.
3.5	Sail Date: Jun 25, 2017 /	I would go again to experience the ships, but the itinerary was terrible.  Would rather save money and go on Carnival if not going on an Oasis Class ship.
4.6	Sail Date: Jun 25, 2017 /	"The port is really nice.  Easy in/Easy out. 
The ship is beautifully maintained.  Very big.  Too much to do and too many things that cost extra even with the drink package (coconut/pineapple drinks), etc.
Too many restaurants for a 7 day cruise.  Expensive, when the main dining room is just fine.
Service was great.
Labbadee is very over priced.
Dunns River Falls - amazing - but crowded
Cozumel - Playa Mia - our favorite!"
5.0	Sail Date: Jun 18, 2017 /	My husband and I took our 11 year old granddaughter and her 11 year old friend on the 7 day cruise. We all had a great time. Our room steward, Victor, the staff in the dining room (Juliet), Chops (Darwin) and the Coastal Kitchen/Lounge were very attentive and paid extra attention to the girls. Would definitely cruise with Royal Caribbean again!!
5.0	Sail Date: Jun 18, 2017 /	The Oasis of the Seas is the 2nd largest ship in the world. It is filled with so many fun activities. The food is outstanding!!! The service and staff are exceptional. It was the best family vacation. We highly recommend it.
1.0	Sail Date: Jun 18, 2017 /	This was a really great cruise. Everything was great from the room attendant to the servers. The only port I really did not like was St. Maarten but other than that everything was good.
5.0	Sail Date: Jun 18, 2017 /	I would definitely recommend this cruise. It was fantastic! The ship was beautiful and very clean, the service was terrific, the food delicious, plenty of activities for everyone and the shows were awesome!!
5.0	Sail Date: Jun 11, 2017 /	Third time was the charm. Loved every time on the Oasis or Allure, but this was the best!  Everything was perfect from start to finish-ship condition, service, food, ports, and entertainment. Looking forward to a future cruise.
5.0	Sail Date: Jun 11, 2017 /	The team on this cruise was fabulous! The ship was beautiful as well! We enjoyed the pianist, Andrew, in the Schooner Lounge as well as the the wait staff there. The entertainment was great. There were a couple of nights that the entertainment seemed lacking, but that may be because we weren't interested in the main events (such as dance parties). We would definitely sail on the Oasis again!
5.0	Sail Date: Jun 11, 2017 /	I've had many vacations but this is my first cruise. Oasis of the Seas is a great ship. I enjoyed every single moment on board. There is so much to do you almost have to stay up day and night to see it and do it all. I had a ball.
5.0	Sail Date: Jun 11, 2017 /	This ship is GORGEOUS!  There is so much to do, you can never get bored.  I was on this cruise with my family of six and my sister and her family, celebrating three graduations.  The ports were beautiful and we always have a good time in St. Maarten.  My only complaint would be people making reservations for My Time DIning, online!  The point of My Time Dining is to make reservations when you get on the ship and make them according to the shows you will be going to see.  That brings me to the shows...We were not able to get into any shows (except Cats, and we left that early) as they were all booked!!!  I know this is a larger ship than Freedom of the Seas, but we never miss a show on Freedom.  It was a little disappointing, but we found other things to do, so it all worked out.
5.0	Sail Date: Jun 11, 2017 /	This was my second time on this ship. Food in the Dining Room and Buffet were above average.  Wait staff (Sam Thomas and Wayan) went out of their way to make sure we had everything we wanted and more.  The only disappointment I had was on Labadee.  I rented an over the water cabana for $495 for the day.  It was supposed to be private, but my cabana attendant did a poor job from keeping other guests from coming up our private walkway and entering our cabana to ask questions or call down to their children in the water.  I had to sternly tell him to block the steps with a lounge chair.  HIs excuse was his fellow workers were on vacation.  Well, so am I!  I wouldn't rent one of these cabanas in the future.  It was on Nellis beach, cabana NW3.  Other that this, the cruise was perfect.
5.0	Sail Date: Jun 11, 2017 /	"The cruise was fantastic...Everyone needs to go on this ship at least once. It had everything you could think of. The variety of food, entertainment, shops were excellent. All the workers in all areas, make you feel like something special.

It was the best cruise my husband & I have ever taken. We are recommending this cruise to everyone."
4.0	Sail Date: Jun 11, 2017 /	"comedy shows sell out fast so schedule asap

should have more places to get cofee early in the morning, only one place to go and not really advertised.

crew was friendly and professional.

highly recommend the ATV tour in st. marten."
1.0	Sail Date: Jun 11, 2017 /	This was not our first trip on an Oasis class ship, our kids really enjoy all the activities offered on this class (16,14 and 6).  We were pleased with the stops, least of which was PR.
4.9	Sail Date: Jun 11, 2017 /	I love Royal Caribbean!  This was our first time on RC. We've been on Carnival and Norwegian.  I will cruise with them again!  The staff was friendly.  I was very impressed overall.
5.0	Sail Date: Jun 04, 2017 /	fantastic experience! Amazing ship with an even more amazing crew. Constant activities on board of all types. The destinations we traveled to left a remarkable impression. We will deffinatley be cruising again.
3.0	Sail Date: Jun 04, 2017 /	My Dad wanted us to sail on this ship b/c he was impresses by the size; he lived to regret it a bit.  It was truly a lot more walking for him that he hadn't considered.  Pros for this ship: The food and staff were 5 stars from service, to taste to presentation.  My room was always tidy--kinda creepy how he knew when to show up??.  There was always a Jacuzzi open.  Central Park was unreal--in a good way, esp when a violinist is playing!  Cons:  activities for adults and teens shut down earlier than other cruises, I always felt like I was running from one end of the ship to the other, the teen activities that my teens really wanted to go to always seemed to be in the middle of dinner time and my teens said the music was really lacking.  I was told that there would be a daily gathering for 18-21 yo folks, but there never was.  My 18 yo daughter went to the night clubs but found kids her age so she had fun.
5.0	Sail Date: Jun 04, 2017 /	Everything about this ship was over the top. We loved the beautiful venues from a actual live park complete with nightly classical music to the Boardwalk with a real Merry go round.  The street partys on the Promenade were so much fun. Our favorite restaurant was the American Icon Grille which was complimentary and so delicious. The service was excellent. The staff were friendly and accommodating. Our room attendant Andrea was a hardworking and kind man who worked nonstop to keep the rooms clean and with fresh towels. I can't say enough about how wonderful this ship and its staff were. Just a relaxing and awesome cruise.
4.0	Sail Date: Jun 04, 2017 /	Enjoyed the cruise and it would have received a 5 Star rating if it wasn't for paying extra for soda packages and having to run around the ship to find a soda machine that was not out of soda, ice, or carbonation or completely out of order.
4.0	Sail Date: Jun 04, 2017 /	This was my third cruise and my first with Royal.  Overall it went beyond my expectation as long as you as plan all the activities right.  The only suggestion would be if the customer bought the digital copy  package of the photo, you may as well give them the printed as well. I don't believe the cruise line will reuse the paper to reprint. Food and services are extraordinary.
5.0	Sail Date: Jun 04, 2017 /	"We were more than thankful with the service and quality of our first cruise.

Throughout our entire time on the cruise we were treated like royalty.

We will definitly be cruising with the Oasis of the Seas again.."
4.0	Sail Date: Jun 04, 2017 /	"Favorite part was the evening meals in the dining room except for the guests ignoring the dress code, of which there were many.  Service and food in the dining room was excellent except for the deserts.  Best overall desert was the ice cream.

Stateroom was excellent and our steward was above par.

Hadn't considered the weather when we booked.  Wrong time of year for this cruise due to the outside temperatures.  Made having an outside balcony mostly useless.  Would have been better off with a less expensive ocean view.

Also there were an excessive number of children on board due to schools having ended for the year.

Food at the buffet was mostly mediocre with no variety from day to day. Best desert at the buffet were the cookies.  The gallery just does not know how to do cakes and pastries especially the cheesecake was awful.

The seas were mostly calm the ports, we barely got off the ship.

We did not appreciate the constant almost badgering to buy drinks, excursions or have our pictures taken.  Also didn't appreciate the mandatory tipping charges with no ability to opt out.

The ship was great and mostly relaxing.  The entertainment was first class. 

,"
5.0	Sail Date: May 28, 2017 /	Ship, service, food, activities all fabulous.  You can't help having a SUPER time even the children were in awe.Port Canaveral crew had everything set up and you were on the ship before you could believe it.  Very little waiting-highly qualified staff.
5.0	Sail Date: May 28, 2017 /	It was our first cruise. We were surprised how well 5000 passengers fit onto such a big ship. Not crowded at all.  It felt like being in a little town. Lots of stuff to do or you can also take it easy and stay in your nice cabin. We choose a cabin with balcony what was worth every penny. The air condition was perfect, you can set the temperature yourself and it's running silent. Also is the cabin extremely well insulated against noise. There is nothikng you hear from neighbors next to you or above. Very well organized going on or off the ship. Fast and easy. Unbelievable how fast the suitcases were handled. We are now hooked to do cruises!
2.0	Sail Date: May 28, 2017 /	"The Food- 
The food in the main dining areas has sunk below Carnival and Norwegian.  It's like RCCL is forcing us to go to a specialty restaurant to get a quality meal.  The steaks in the main dining halls are so over processed they do not bleed when they are cut even when ordered at medium rare.  I had a steak that was the color of a pale pork chop.  It was red on the inside but didn't have any juice in it at all.  We hated the menu.  HATED IT.  Even with the processed steaks that I hated were better than the other selections and I was forced to order it even after complaining about it.  The at sea breakfasts in the main dining hall was really disappointing compared to the last visit on the Oasis 2 years ago.  Cost savings is killing the quality and choices.  The Windjammer is the worst buffet on the seas.  US Navy food is better.  The employees at the Windjammer stand over the children in an intimidating way and I watched an employee shame a kid for accidentally dropping a piece of beef on the floor.  If he did that to my child it would have went to the Captain of the ship. It was that disturbing watching a grown man humiliate a kid for an accident. The Solarium which claims to be the ""Healthy"" option had the same breakfast  buffet crap as the rest of the ship.  They had a few health food items but the majority of the items were the same. The bacon is so salty it felt like I swallowed a mouthful of salt water. Healthy choice??   Park Café,  the hot dog stand on the Boardwalk, and Sorrento’s were the only complimentary bright spots.  Towards the end of the cruise, however, the breakfast sandwiches at Park Café were getting served cold because of over preparing but the roast beef sandwich at lunch was excellent.  The hot dogs and sausage were 100% better than last cruise and this time the buns were fresh.  The free pizza improved a lot over the previous cruise.  The best food items on the ship are the fast food places.  The food quality destroyed the vacation.

   

The hostesses (male and female) in the main dining halls are condescending and act like you're getting a thousand dollar meal.  It's laughable and disappointing at the same time.  It’s laughable because the food is horrible and sad because RCCL used to be so much better.

   Many guests don't want to dress up for formal night.  From what I can see is when you get served ""Golden Coral"" quality food you want to wear shorts and a t-shirt to dinner.  Years ago we selected Royal over other cruise lines because of the food.  This trip the vacation was almost destroyed by the disgusting food.

   

We did the ""First Night Done Right"" and went to Chops Grille.  The service, appetizers and desserts were incredible. Get the sea scallops appetizer and you won't be disappointed.  However, I make a better NY Strip at home.  Still the steak was 100% better than the steak in the main dining hall.

   

After spending all this money for a vacation, all my 3 kids said every day was ""we have such better food at home"".  Maybe a new meat supplier?  Maybe they should just get some Trader Joe's frozen meals to up the quality a bit too.

 

 

The Cabin-  We had a superior family ocean view w balcony room on the 6th floor aft which was described to us as big enough for 5 people.  We lived out of our suit cases under the bed because there isn't enough shelf room for 5 people's socks and underpants.  We lived like sardines but the ocean view was great.  The 6th floor aft is close to all the food and activities which is very important on a ship that holds over 6,000 people.  It was also very quite because the Boardwalk closes early.  The room was cleaned twice a day and we always had clean towels.  

 

 

Entertainment-  
""Cats"" was on the ship 2 years ago and is still the main attraction.  I had seen it on Broadway many years ago and wasn't in the mood to see it for a 3rd time.  I wish they would change the entertainment a little more for frequent (or kind of frequent) cruisers.  The water show  I had seen last time on the Oasis 2 years ago.  If it was changed at all it wasn't as good as it was last time.  The show with the guy with an umbrella was also the same show as 2 years ago.  Entertainment basically was a rerun of 2 years ago.  RCCL is in a rut.  

Also, last cruise we did not see the show at the skating rink but we did this trip.  The show was very entertaining but it’s nothing I would rush out to see again. I would highly recommend seeing it, once. 

The entertainment highlight- We learned how to make sushi at Izumi.  That was the best entertainment we had on the ship.  After making the sushi you get to eat it.  It’s available on 2 days during the cruise

 

 

Service-  
We had some of the best waiters and waitresses that we ever had on a ship.  Unfortunately, we received the excellent service after complaining about the poor quality food.  Great service does not conquer garbage on a plate.  One of the waiters was so tired of hearing about the bad steaks he asked me to explain it to several supervisors.  He said he was frustrated by the upset guests.

 

A few of the employees on the Flow-Rider are on power trips with the kids.  They help some and give others a single turn.  A very tall and thin employee told a kid he could only have one 60 second or so run because he was trying to move the long line only to spend 5 minutes teaching another kid how to do a trick a few minutes later.   It wasn’t a race issue because they were all Caucasian but it wasn’t right for what ever reason.

 


Ports- 
-Nassau, Bahamas-  We did the Sting Ray Encounter.  It's located on the Sandals Resort and the employees are very nice.  They calmed the kids and encouraged them to handle the rays.  You cannot bring a camera so you are almost forced to pay close to $100.- for the pictures of the excursion.  Beautiful  water to enjoy for an hour after the rays.  Bring your own snorkel or rent it on the beach.

 

St. Thomas-  Did the BOSS underwater scooter for the kids.   On the boat we were given a brief that said that the guys working there would be happy to help the women shower off after they got out of the salt water.  The also stated if the boat sank that if they woman wanted to be saved not having clothing may help them get saved faster.  They also stated smoking was permitted on the boat.  As we were heading to the site several people started getting sea sick but that did not stop the crew from smoking.  I felt like I was back in a 1970’s blue collar New Jersey locker room.  The best part of the excursion was the snorkeling.   However, they do not warn you about the “Fire Coral” on the rocks where they tell you to snorkel.  My wife had a wave push her into some and her stomach and thighs were completely raw from the venom.  She was in so much pain I had to swim her back to the boat.  I’ve never seen her in so much pain.  If you’re unaware of it please Google it to see how serious this stuff is and can be.   The guys working on the boat laughed and sprayed her with Windex.  Their idea of customer service was telling her to “Get on her big girl underpants and get back in the water” when it was her time to go on the scooter.  That is what they said to her word for word.  The BOSS scooter riding time was a joke.  It was about 20 minutes of riding around an all sand area.  It was an underwater desert so you couldn’t run a scooter into any rocks.  The area was also completely void of any sea life except when the opened a bag of food and a few schools of common fish swarmed around you.  That only happens when the scooter is stopped and makes you feel like you’re surrounded by fish.  The scooter was slow and boring but at least I tried something new.  As far as my wife’s Fire Coral burns they basically told her there was nothing other than the Windex or ammonia to put on it.  9 days later she still has pain and discomfort from the coral.  Upon arriving back to the Oasis I went to medical and was told they didn’t have anything to treat fire coral because it was against International  Law to have ammonia on board.  A few days later we talked to the Padi Dive Store and they told us we should have used vinegar.   Vinegar the 1st or 2nd day would have helped her.  A day later we went to the shore excursion desk and she told us that she would give us 20% off the excursion because of the horrible experience.  She mistakenly only refunded my wife and I’s trip and forgot to discount our 3 kids.  I guess I was wrong to expect anything else.  Horrible excursion and clueless Oasis medical staff.  

 

The shopping around the port is a joke.  It’s dirty and low class.

 

 

St Maarten-  We did the Snuba trip and enjoyed it.  You take a 10 minute boat ride to an area with a few man made reefs to snuba and snorkel on in shallow water.   The area was very crowded because it seemed like all the snorkeling, snuba and diving tours went to the same location.  We have a group of 5 and the snuba groups are broken into groups of 4.  The first 2 groups going out  had 2 groups of 4 going out.  We were told they would tr to have us go at the same time at least because we couldn’t go together.  Apparently it was too difficult or confusing  for them to allow our family to go out at the same time so we couldn’t all snorkel together which is the point of a family vacation.  They said they would try to send ou out at the same time but it didn’t happen.  My wife was still suffering the severe effects of the Fire Coral and had trouble breathing at the end of the snuba dive.  It was good but could have been much more enjoyable if we had been able to at least snorkel together at the same time.

 

Overall if you’ve been on the Oasis within the last 2 years expect it to be a rerun entertainment wise.  The food quality has fallen off a cliff and the employees are even tired about hearing it.  We had already scheduled a cruise for next summer before taking this one and we are now looking at other options."
5.0	Sail Date: May 28, 2017 /	We loved the large ship with so many activities, shows, and restaurants.  Our cabin steward, Margaret, was always available and seemed to never sleep!  Our waiters Ankur an Albert were outstanding, as they always are.  If Ankur is your waiter, be sure to ask about his magic and physics - best I've seen!  Cruise Director, Tim, and Activities Director Magic Marvin were a lot of fun.  Royal Caribbean is our favorite cruise line.
5.0	Sail Date: May 28, 2017 /	"Everything was perfect!  The crew was always helpful as you would expect on a RC cruise.  BUT.... here's something special:

 

During the cruise, we took a tour below decks, visiting the Galley.  During the tour we met one of the head chefs..he was from the Philippines.  My wife and I mentioned a Philippine (Pancit) dish we really enjoy but never have because it is not available in our local restaurants. The Chef made sure that for my wife's birthday she had a special meal.  The chef prepared a HUGE and I mean HUGE platter of Pancit and had it delivered to our table.  Fresh/hot and absolutely delicious!  There was enough to pass the dish to others seated near us so they may share in the experience.  Later, the chef had a special birthday cake delivered as well and the entire wait staff sang ""Happy Birthday"" to my wife.

Royal Caribbean also had a bottle of champagne delivered to our room in celebration of her birthday.  Our room attendant also decorated the room with streamers and a ""cake"" made from specially folded towels.

 

I could go on and on about the ports of call... but for me it is about the cruise ship experience, not so much the places we visited.  For me, the ship is my vacation destination and everyplace else we visited is a bonus.

 

If you are thinking about taking a cruise... you have to go Royal Caribbean!  They are the best in the business."
1.0	Sail Date: May 21, 2017 /	Would not rexcomend this ship. Out cabin guy was great!  He tried to help us many times with the air in our room.  Food was decent.  Breakfast was same old same old in every restaurant. You need a variety.  My hubs, my son and I could have went to Hawaii for a week or more on what money I spent on this cruise, including flight and rooms, but I wanted the cruise.  Wish I had a do-over.  That was my 1st and last cruise with RC.
4.0	Sail Date: May 21, 2017 /	Beautiful ship. Felt like we were on a floating city.  Didn't even feel like you were on a ship.  For the most part, it was a great cruise.  Beautiful weather!!!.  We had a Jr. Suite which allowed us use of the Coastal Kitchen for dinner only.  Food was excellent but you needed a key to get in and only regular suites or Pinnacle members had those.  Kind of humiliating to have to knock on the door.  They need to change that.  Very happy with the size of the suite though.  Excellent dinners at Chops, Giovanni's and 150 Central Park.  Windjammer was too crowded and hard to find seats.  Food okay there.  Loved the coffee ship in Central Park.  Our favorite coffee.   Well worth purchasing the drink package, since it included coffee and water also, which we drank a lot of as well as alcohol.  Comedy show was hysterical!!!  Looking forward to our next cruise.
5.0	Sail Date: May 21, 2017 /	Had the best time. Will definitely do it again. Food was great and really loved ports and excursions. Staff very friendly. Plenty to do each day. Family friendly, too.
5.0	Sail Date: May 21, 2017 /	The Oasis of the Seas is an incredible ship with so much to do.  There were 6,000 people onboard, but it was never crowded anywhere!  The excursions were great.  Everything was fantastic!
4.0	Sail Date: May 21, 2017 /	This was our second trip on Oasis. Still love it and the Oasis class. We loved having three days at sea. Perfect for relaxing. Like the ports.  We chose not to do any excursions.  Some of the entertainment needs to be updated. Same Aqua show and Come Fly with Me show that we saw four years ago. Good shows but... The musical Cats was only shown once as it was cancelled the other times. Not sure why.  Food and service was good? Overall a fun relaxing trip.
4.0	Sail Date: May 21, 2017 /	I enjoyed myself and it was so relaxing but at times I found myself bored it wasn't as exciting and fun than Carnival. But Royal Caribbean is way more scenic and beautiful hands down. However, the crowd was a little too old for me.
4.0	Sail Date: May 21, 2017 /	"We had a really nice time on the Oasis. The ship was clean, well kept and there was so much to see and do while on the ship. The staff is simply AMAZING. Can't say enough good things about the casino staff and the bartenders in the champagne bar and of course our room attendant and mytime dinner staff. 

 

Excursions were well organized and communication was clear on what to do and how to get on and off the boat. 

 

We loved it and will be back!"
2.0	Sail Date: May 14, 2017 /	My favorite part of the cruise was the day we got off in Cozumel, the Beach break was absolutley fabulous!This was NOT done by Royal Caribbean it was a private that we found online.  I can tell you that bigger is NOT better. We were so disappointed with dining room service, we never saw the cruise director except for on their TV Chanel, the food in the dining room was mediocre to say the least, but on a positive note the specialty restaurants we wonderful.  This cruise was so crowded, so many kids that I thought we had gotten on the wrong cruise ship and boarded a carnival ship or Disney.  This was my 5th cruise with Royal Caribbean and I can assure you it will be my last.  I really feel that since they began adding gratuities on a daily basis per person in each cabin that service as really gone down hill.  What in the world happened to Robes being placed in your cabin, or just the little added touch of shampoo, conditioner and soap in the showers, and a chocolate on your pillow at night.  Am I asking for too much?  Do I expect too much?  For the price of this cruise I do not think so, they used to do it, not anymore folks, its all about the money and how many people they can cram on this ship.  Don';t waste your time or money on Royal Caribbean anymore.
4.0	Sail Date: May 14, 2017 /	there was a lot to do on the cruise, very satisfy with the crew and very friendly couldn't ask for more. will def. do it again with my family the only thing is that i wish that the ship had a bit more options to dine in for free instead of paying for some of the restaurants.
3.0	Sail Date: May 14, 2017 /	My husband and I were on a ship that got attacked with a virus and we still are not well! Because of this ship either not being cleaned and disinfected well enough or people not washing their hands, we are now suffering and spending doctors bills we shouldn't have to as well as being absolutely miserable while on the ship. We were never offered any sort of compensation either after all we went through and are still going through with this dreaded sickness.
4.0	Sail Date: May 14, 2017 /	The service, dinners, facilities were amazing.   I would use caution when taking your excursions.  If your excursion does not go as described, make formal complaints to the manager of the excursion/or guide,  immediately report this to RCL management aboard the ship.  If you call after the cruise has ended, they will refund your money!
5.0	Sail Date: May 14, 2017 /	Had a wonderful time.  All the ports were nice and had plenty to do, shopping and excursions.  We would absolutely travel Royal Caribbean again.  The food on the ship was excellent except for one evening, other than that we had no complaints.  Entertainment on board was wonderful and we enjoyed all of the shows.  Service, both cabin and restaurant  was excellent, no complaints, very attentive to every need.
5.0	Sail Date: May 14, 2017 /	I cruise with my mother once a year and always have a great time.  This ship was amazing.  The food was outstanding, the shows were amazing, the entertainment throughout the ship was incredible.  We had the BEST time ever.  I will definitely will cruise again on the Oasis. I loved the ship!!!
5.0	Sail Date: May 14, 2017 /	there was so much to do. Food was fabulous. The crew was outstanding. I didn't want to come home. Thank you for a memorable vacation. Loved it.I am ready to go back.
5.0	Sail Date: May 14, 2017 /	Very beautiful ship staff was very friendly. Entertainment was very good. The spa facilities were very clean and also the staff was very friendly. Loading and unloading at Port Canerval went very smooth my family and I were very pleased.
5.0	Sail Date: May 14, 2017 /	It doesn't feel like you are on a ship ... Especially in the Central Park area and the Bosrwalk area was a fun place to be.  There are so many oils and hot tubs to choose from and everyone was so friendly.  We were afraid that with so many people there would be long lines for everything but we never had to wait very long for anything... Except maybe elevators which is odd because there are so many.  My husband would like to request that the bars carry an IPA in their beer selections but otherwise we were more than pleased with all of the drinks and we both found some new favorites.  We really loved the Ice show, the acrobat show and the aqua show!
3.0	Sail Date: May 14, 2017 /	Dinner time was one of the best excellent service good quality food and the personal always with a smiley face asking you how they can help, shows are unique the best of the best, night time at the disco unforgettable moments
3.0	Sail Date: May 14, 2017 /	The shows were fantastic. I did not like that they close the pools and hot tubs about 830. I like to sit it the hot tub in the evenings and that was  not an option. I also did not like that ice and drinks were poorly accessible. Mostly only water available but no ice. The main dinning room seemed rushed and crowded.
5.0	Sail Date: May 07, 2017 /	"My favorite part of the cruise is ALWAYS the food! I love going on vacation and not having to worry about cooking or picking a place to eat. There are so many different options on the Oasis of the Seas which is nice. Also, the ships through Royal Caribbean are always clean and the staff is always friendly! Definitely our favorite cruise line. 

 

One suggestion I have as far as the Adventure Ocean goes for the kids. I thought some type of pager would be nice for the younger kids just in case they were to get upset and not calm down while the parents are away."
5.0	Sail Date: May 07, 2017 /	I loved the cruise only improvements need to be the smell in casino I'm usually a big gambler but the smell was so bad and only gambled about 30 minutes till I got sick other improvements would be to have more accessible ice and more of the coke machines
5.0	Sail Date: May 07, 2017 /	EVERYTHING was truly fantastic on this cruise! I was happily surprised that everything exceeded my expectations: The room, the service, the food, the shows, everything. I have been raving about my trip since I've been back, and can't wait to book my next trip!
3.0	Sail Date: May 07, 2017 /	"Anytime dining was our favorite. We had some issues with staff (Wipe Out Bar),

not servicing all nationalities. The same issue happened in the Wind Jammer, with the woman serving ice cream. She deliberately skipped my daughter whom had been standing there well before the other cruisers walked up (While People) and she preceded to skip my daughter and asked the other two how she could help.

 

Same issues at the bar, just flat out ignored my husband whom had been standing there before a white guy, and the bartender, deliberately skipped him. The white guy had to say, ""hey he was here before me""

 

The staff on the ship (not all) definitely have some issues with helping everyone.

 

We all paid money to get on the ship, we all want/demand to receive the service we paid for, regardless of the color of our skin!"
5.0	Sail Date: May 07, 2017 /	First I want to say this ship cannot be accurately described in words, it is amazing in every way imaginable, from the moment you step on your blown away by its beauty, cleanliness, and soooo many things to see and do there is no way to do even half of them in 7 days! The chops grill is great, givonies itailian is very good, sabor very great and our waiter made it that much better! Johnny rockets has a great cheese burger and awesome shake, breakfast is free there so skip the windjammer with the large crowds and eat there instead! even though we sailed with a full ship we never felt crowded, its just that BIG! Be sure to check out the art gallery they have some really nice stuff and even if you dont buy anything is worth checking out and looking at the fine art and enjoying some free champange. The casino is very nice we won a jackpot on a slot for $984.02! THe solarioum is the way to go, we stayed on ship during one stop and enjoyed it, very very nice. now for the negatives, you will feel some what nickel and dimed at times, because while breakfast is free at johnny rockets they charge for lunch, and dinner, the arcades and nice as the are see very little use and there is rarly anyone in them bc they cahrge for each and every game machine in there! As far as shopping you may well be just like us and find that alot of the shops you want to check out are closed more often than not, perhaps they just where when we went but seems they would keep them open all the time with that many people, dont know on that one. the windjammer seems to close to early at night in my opinion, there are alot of people like us who prefer to go to show, bars, casino, ect. before they eat but it would be closed when we got there, and as far as quality of food in there its fair at best. Now for our room it was small but adacuate, however the air seemed to never cool, we where told to lock balcony door and it would cool but this never happend, when I spoke to customer service the claimed it was at approx. 71-72 degrees but should be running about 68 degrees, they said the would fix it but that never happened and I wasnt going to waste more time dealing with it. these issues are minor and did not affect our enjoyment of this great ship! We will be back again!
5.0	Sail Date: May 07, 2017 /	"I was cautious. I'd never cruised a large ship before and was worried about crowds and finding my way around the ship. but I needn't have. 

 

When this ship was built, they must have taken special care to make it look big but feel small. With 24 elevators, there was never a problem with stuffing. There were no lines getting into the dining room and the roominess of the prominade prevented problems getting around with sales. There really were no lines to any of the venues. 

 

Entertainment? Broadway shows, comedy shows, ice shows, diving shows... 2 climbing walls, vollyball, basketball, ping pong, zip line, ice skating, 2 flowriders, putt-putt... There's no way you couldn't find something to do. 

 

There are only a couple of negatives... and they're not that bad... and they're just my opinion. First, the windjammer is the windjammer. I think it's named because people blow around the place, jamming even more into a tight space. It was tough finding tables... Another issue was the hike. Getting from the front to back took awhile. While it didn't seem so bad taking the hike through the promenade.. looking down the hall on the stateroom levels reminded you the ship is over 3 football fields long and 200 ft wide!  Lastly, reservations for the shows were a bit of a challenge. They were full, then they weren't... then they were. Still, we were able to take in almost all the shows we wanted. 

 

Food was what we've come to expect.  The Windjammer fare seems the same as on any ship. The same goes for the MDR... same same... and very good. Our supervisor, waiter, and asst. waiter were attentive almost to the point of diestration. All were super accomodating. We hesitated to eat elsewhere and miss their service. What's nice is there are several venues that offer food. There's Sorentos, Park Cafe, and my fav, the Hot Dog shack. All in all, I think I gained 5 pounds. 

 

Lastly, getting on and off the ship was a breeze. The rebuilt terminal made the process quick. We checked in and walked on board immediately. Our number was called early and the time between walking off the ship to being at the curb was less than 15 minutes. 

 

Bottom line, Oasis was a surprise. While big in size, it was small in attentiveness. I would definately sail her again!"
5.0	Sail Date: May 07, 2017 /	"Love the Oasis.   This was our third trip and decided to upgrade to a Grand Suite and we were not disappointed at all.   The suite is quite awesome and roomy and the Conceirge lounge and restaurant are perfect.   We ended up eating almost all our dinners there... well worth it

We did decide to visit Chops again which we have done on every other of our previous cruises.   To our disappointment, we found that they really have reduced the steak choices and now even charge extra for the higher cuts.   That would have been fine (although not happy about the price addition) but the Porterhouse that was suppose to be aged tasted more like shoe leather... Very very disappointed in that experience and will probably not visit Chops again 

The Broadway Show Cats was superior as well with extremely talented dancers and singers..   Don't miss that."
3.0	Sail Date: Apr 30, 2017 /	"The embarking experience was excellent as well as the delivery of some of our baggage.  My husband's baggage came as we were going to dinner--much too late of arrival.  Food was very good as well as the service and attitude of our waiters.  The background music which was played throughout the ship didn't interest us as we were not familiar with any of it.  Just once a day it would have been nice to hear music from the 50's, 60's, even 70's. The entertainment was above average, but the production of CATS was really pretty bad.  About 1/3 of the audience left at intermission.  The loud speaker announcements were mostly not understood because of the accent of the person making them.  We could tell that those of us over 70 were not catered to in any way; in fact, the noise of their continual loud music was annoying.

We did appreciate the room credits ($$) we received from  as well as the specialty dinner at Chops.  Royal Caribbean was used by me for at least five or more cruises, but I have to really think if it will be used again.

We would like a ship that sometimes have entertainment for the ""over 60"" crowd.  We also always enjoyed dressing for formal nights.  On this cruise the ""formal dress"" was merely a suggestion and not many guests paid any attention to it.  We thank you for arranging this for us and realize that your organization had nothing to do with the ship's daily activities."
4.0	Sail Date: Apr 30, 2017 /	My family and I had a great time! This ship is huge! So many things to do. For me I think I prefer a smaller ship. The food in the main dining room was not that good. I was never disappointed with the food in the Windjammer. The service on the ship was great! Everyone goes out of their way to help. I didn't like having to make reservations for some of the shows but that definitely didn't ruin our fun. This was also our first time having a balcony and I highly recommend it!!! We will definitely be cruising Royal Caribbean again. 😊
2.0	Sail Date: Apr 30, 2017 /	"The ship itself is clean and beautiful.  Everyone was happy and helpful.  What I did not enjoy was additional and high costs for internet, the drinks.  Constantly trying to sell you additional dining options, shore excursions, etc.  The casino was terrible.  Old, boring machines which paid you literally pennies.  Anyone who goes to casino can see the difference in updated machines and old ones.  The odds of winning are extremely low.  Lost interest after an hour.  BORING and a waste.

 

Port Shopping.  I am so angry about this part that I'm having difficulty containing myself.  After attending 2 seminars on board giving us advice on which stores they stand behind, I trusted RC.  We went to Diamonds International where we spent almost $30,000 in one store.  When I returned home I had my diamond ring appraised and what I paid $23,000 was appraised at $8,000.  The other 2 items list for half of what I paid for them.  This is deliberate fraud by the stores, the cruise line, and their port shopping advisers.  They lead us to believe they were educating us as to what were the best stores to shop that they stood behind.  When in reality it was the best stores in which they would realize a very generous kickback by overcharging and stealing from the consumer.  I will be sure to share my experience with many others so that they don't become a victim like I and so many others have.  You can rest assured that this will not be the end of my experience.  It's too bad, because this aspect of my Cruise ruined what otherwise would have been a good vacation.  One that my husband and I deserved after overcoming medical and personal issues."
5.0	Sail Date: Apr 30, 2017 /	My first royal carribean cruise. I will definately go one again. Planning one already. My waiter sasa and Xue. were top notch ( i work in th eservice industry). nothing bad to say only great things
4.0	Sail Date: Apr 30, 2017 /	This was our 2nd time on Oasis and it was again truly wonderful and amazing. The food in the MDR was good to very good and we ate at Chops, Giovanni's table and 150 CP- all were incredible and fabulous. We especially enjoyed the solarium and spent alot of time there. It is so peaceful and beautiful and the solarium bistro is a great place to go for breakfast. The only true negative which kept me from giving 5 stars was that there was a large corporate group on board and they closed venues at times for their gatherings and I did not like that. As a paying customer I paid for full use of all the venues and this did not happen at all times. It became very irritating having to put up with all their goings on. None the less, we made the best of it and had a great time just the same.
5.0	Sail Date: Apr 30, 2017 /	The entire cruise was great. Fast service and easy to get on and off the boat. Staff were all friendly and helpful. Food was good and ship was clean. Lots of fun things to see and do on the ship. It can be difficult to refill your pop with the drink package  only a few self service place on the entire ship
3.0	Sail Date: Apr 30, 2017 /	I wood give the cruise line a 5. This is the 1st time I have been on a ship that had a huge group on it, and for me it kind of rained my cruise. Let me mention that this was the 1st time my teen children have been on a cruise. When I went to book excursions on line everything my children had choose was booked. I finally talked to a cruise agent who told me to try once we were on board, it was at this point I found out we had a group of over 2500 on board, they had booked the excursions we had wanted, ( Several of the people from that group during that week said that they had about 3000 on board). The people at the excursions desk showed me other options but they didn't really compare to what we had chosen, then they told me that they were working on getting more excursions to where we wanted to go, if we wanted to be put on a waiting lisr.( a little stressful as it was uncertain and we had an excursions that we wanted to go on the next day.They were pretty confident that they would be able to get us booked, so we wait listed. After dinner we found out we had gotten our 1st choice, Yeah! The next day we had a 8am excursions time, it was very chaotic, and way to many people., Once we got into Paradise Island (lucky for us the place is huge and the group dispersed) the rest of the excursion went well, except for the fact we lost about 45 mins. To an hour because of boarding to get to Paradise  Island,  and we were had already lost an hour due to the ship getting to port late. They weren't able to get us our 1st choice for the 2nd excursion, but we were happy with the recommendation. On the 3rd excursion we were suppose to be on a wait list bit still hadnt heard anything by mis day the day before so we checked on it and were told theu didn't see us on the lisr, the excursion desk apologised and wirhin 15 minutes got us in. Thebig group seemed to have all the reservation for the comedy club, which we couldn't get into until the last night, when they finally put the acts in the main theatre. I will definitely ask next time. The grouo was EVERYWHERE and I think it took away from one of the reasons I like cruises,  and that is to meet a diverse group of people. The group was clickie and had a lot of team activities to do. I think that there might have been more families on board if the space wasn't taken up by this big group.I has looked forward to my children meeting other children and making lasting friendships. I will definitely ask of there is going to be a big group next time I book a cruise, as I will change my ship if there is. The staff and FOOD was amazing, as usual.
2.0	Sail Date: Apr 30, 2017 /	This was my first time traveling on oasis of the sea's. I have to admit I wasn't too impressed and I'm sure I will not be doing this one again.  We have always wanted to sail on the oasis of the sea's. So me along with 10 other couples book this cruise. (Ages 29-38) Our friends and I usually do a cruise every year. This is my 13th Cruise I have been on. The oasis of the seas is absolutely amazing! This ship is like nothing I've ever seen.  However it's way too big and way too many people. You literally have to plan your whole entire week with shows, comedians, reservations for dinner at restaurants etc in advance. if you don't you will not be allowed to attend.  I love other cruise lines and just  being able to get out of dinner and say OK, what should we do tonight? There is a show at this time, a comedian at this time and just being able to go do whatever you want for that night. Not here! The food on the oasis is absolutely horrible. We skipped the main dining the last three nights and went to the Windjammer. Again, due to the vast majority of people they have to make the food in large quantities. Everything is pre-made in large pans. No omelette station, No Asian cooking stations. Absolutely no fresh cooking. The ice cream machines have set hours and closes at 5 PM every night. Seriously!? That's one of the main reasons I go on a cruise! In closing staff were great, ship was amazing but we will definitely stick with Carnival or smaller ships to have more of the personal experience.
5.0	Sail Date: Apr 23, 2017 /	"The cruise was wonderful!  It's a huge ship!  It offers so many things to do.  I encourage future guest to do their homework before arrival.  Try to learn the ship early, and all it has to offer. Really put time into planning the excursions.  We had a balcony, which was a great place to get away from the crowds and relax. The food, the shows, the crew, the room - all of it was wonderful!   

 

The one thing Royal Caribbean should try to improve is offering instruction/directions to guest concerning dinning options, reserved seating in the shows, gym options, etc.  I heard many guest complain about the activity brochure lacking clear directions to the site of the activity.  Many guest had difficulty finding their way around the ship. 

 

But over all, it was wonderful.  I would love to do it all again!"
5.0	Sail Date: Apr 23, 2017 /	Service, food and room were great!  All crew members encountered were friendly and usually spoke first. Sandra our cabin steward was above and beyond helpful and friendly.  Edwin Maya, waiter was excellent as was his assistant.
5.0	Sail Date: Apr 23, 2017 /	"very big ship took a long time to lurn it. the shows were great. rooms were great our room steward  was a great help my wife has AL timers and is in dippers. the food was good but not as good as it used to be before you started the side restaurants. the dining room staff was great. one thing I would like to see is stir-fry

 served on one of the all day food places. it was on one of the cruise ships I was on and it was great. over all it was a great cruise the staff was great

2.0	Sail Date: Apr 23, 2017 /	The ATV with Caverns shore excursion was excellent. Disappointed that, as Platinum level members of the Crown and Anchor Society, we received no special consideration either at embarkation or disembarkation, as has been the case on previous cruises. Our room attendant neglected to give us towel service in our state room on three separate days, bar service personnel were very inattentive, and we had to request a new table in the main dining oom due to an overbearing head waiter who was justbobnoxious rude. The Ship? Beautiful. But the crew on the Oasis was such a disappointment to us after being treated so we'll on six previous Royal Caribbean cruises, that Oasis won't be on any of our itineraries in the future.
1.0	Sail Date: Apr 23, 2017 /	room was falling apart , Refrig. didn't work , dresser drawer broken , toilet didn't work had to fix it 4 times, room very dirty , room steward said Royal now only changes sheets every other day not everyday any more. Crowd control is tatally our of control all over ship. Staff cut so short they are not friendly at all , only doing there job and as little as poooible
5.0	Sail Date: Apr 23, 2017 /	the cruise was relaxing.  lots to do.  the shows were magnificent.  I would do it again if I had the money today. The staff was very friendly and helpful.
4.0	Sail Date: Apr 23, 2017 /	The ship was beautiful and well planned as there were only a few times that one noticed all the folks on board.  We hadn't cruised in 2 yrs so were surprised by the fee for room service( $7.95) for all but a continental breakfast, also the TV movies were limited unless you paid for one ($11.95).  Both of these were free on previous RCCL Cruises.  We are Emerald Class so have done many RCCL Cruises.  We also missed the chocolates on the pillow and we only had 2 towel animals on our beds......a big change from 2 yrs ago.
5.0	Sail Date: Apr 23, 2017 /	My favorite part of the cruise was everything the ports, the sinning experience , the staff and the activities. We love Royal Caribbean and Delta Sky Cruises! one
4.0	Sail Date: Apr 16, 2017 /	My family had a great time on this cruise.  I would highly recommend drink packages.  I was skeptical at first about purchasing them, but it was very nice to be able to get bottled water, soda, specialty coffees, or any drinks at any time without having to spend the extra money on the ship.
4.0	Sail Date: Apr 16, 2017 /	The shows were absolutely the highlight of the trip. If anything got cancelled, it was rescheduled for another time.  There was even a couple of surprise performers!
4.0	Sail Date: Apr 16, 2017 /	"This was my wife's and my 2nd cruise on Royal Caribbean with the 1st being on the Freedom of the Seas.  The ship is huge and there must have been about 5000 guests on board.  We drove to Port Canaveral and stayed overnight at the Radisson at the Port on a 1 night Stay, Eat and Cruise package the night before the cruise and that worked out well.  We were able to leave our car there for the week as part of our package, and a shuttle van took us over to the ship around 10 AM on the day of the cruise.  We were able to board the ship at 11:30 AM so some of the first ones on.  I'd say the hotel deal was just as easy as if we had parked at the dock minus the parking fee. 

 

The food, service and amenities were outstanding. We did the My Time dining each night, and the food and service were outstanding. We booked our times before we cruised and we were seated at the exact time we were scheduled without any delay.  The buffet, Windjammer, was usually busy although we could get a table even at the busiest times without a problem.  The variety of foods at the buffet was good considering it's made in large quantities.  We at breakfast and lunch in there and we were always able to find something decent to eat. It had lots of fruits, vegetables, meats, and some specialties such as Indian and Chinese food which was very good.  

 

We also booked out excursions when we booked the cruise.  We were disappointed when 2 out of our 3 were cancelled.  One was cancelled before we left and the other was cancelled when we were on the ship. Not really a big deal but my wife and I poured through and picked out the ones we thought were the best only to have them cancelled.  We had booked them through RC since they were the preferred activities.  I think RC needs to look more closely at the reasons for the cancellations since if we had kids, they would have been really disappointed.  We stopped at Nassau and did the glass bottom boat. It was ok, nothing special.  In St. Thomas we took at shuttle taxi for $4 per person to downtown where the shopping was. After all we heard about the great prices on jewelry, we didn't think anything was a bargain... except the liquor which was really cheap.  In St. Maarten we did the catamaran and snorkeling ride and that was good.  We went to a cove around the corner from the ship where they had a sunken helicopter, small submarine and a small ship. We saw lots of fish and the guide was very friendly and accommodating. We took a brief ride after the snorkeling toward the airport then returned back to the dock. There are some shops very close to the ship where my wife bought a bracelet at a decent price.  The sales woman was wonderful. 

 

Overall, the cruise was good.  Lots of things to do on it if you like to be active or sit around and relax if that suits you.  It takes some getting acquainted with the ship and how to get from point A to B since it's so large. The show CATS and Come Fly With Me were excellent and we'd recommend them. The ice skating show was also worth the time.  We'd recommend Royal Caribbean and the Oasis of the Seas as a great way to spend a week's vacation. We would also recommend having some backups of your excursions should any of them get cancelled."
2.0	Sail Date: Apr 16, 2017 /	The best part of the cruise is the specialty restaurant . The food was super! Our Room Attendant Joey Barcelona was just the best we have ever had. He was attentive to all our needs. Bad parts are that the liquor in the Diamond lounge was just terrible. There was a very bad selection of liquor. The Vodka was so bad that it gave us a bad headache ,I think it was the least expensive you could find. The breakfast menu was the same everyday, same old stuff. The service in all the restaurants except the specialty one was not that good. I think that Royal is not going up hill, but down. Royal is building bigger, and bigger ships to get the money, but doing nothing good for the who have been loyal to Royal!!!
4.0	Sail Date: Apr 16, 2017 /	"Embarkation was smooth and easy.  When we arrived at the port the lines were extremely long.  Looked like at least 2 hours of waiting.  To our surprise we were through security, checked in and on the ship within a little over a half hour.  Disembarkation was also smooth.  We took our bags off ourselves and were off the ship and through customs within 30 minutes.

Onboard Activities were great for our family.  2 boys (11 and 8) loved to hang at the H2O Zone and sports deck.  They loved playing soccer, ping pong, golf and going on the Flow Rider, Rock Wall and Zip line.

Entertainment - The adults did not do any of the shows but my children did enjoy the Aqua show.

Children's programs - My kids LOVED the programs and attended every night after dinner and sometimes during the day after lunch.

Destinations - We stayed on the ship in the Bahamas.  St. Thomas we went to Coki beach.  The trip to the beach was a little long in traffic.  About 40 minutes.  But the kids loved snorkeling and feeding the fish.  The locals were very nice and accommodating.  Lunch at the beach was surprisingly very good.  St. Maarten we just walked to shops which were about a 15 minute walk.  The locals were very nice and lightly selling their products and beach chairs.

Ship Quality - the ship is HUGE and very clean.

Service and Staff were excellent and accommodating.  Our dinner crew, the pool bar staff and casino bar staff were great.

Food and Dining - I thought the food was good, not excellent.  .  I was a little disappointed that I wasn't able to get the kids ice cream after 11pm, which is when we picked them up from the children's program each night but we were able to get Sorrento's which is always a family favorite.

Our family had a great trip and I would recommend this ship and sail it again.  The ship was large and clean and didn't feel crowded most times."
5.0	Sail Date: Apr 16, 2017 /	The entire cruise was fabulous..There was always something to do and activities to participate in. Mr Jimmy Rogers and Mr Magic Mike was also great. I would listen to them every moring for information about activities that would be going on the ship, they kept us well informed
5.0	Sail Date: Apr 09, 2017 /	First off the ship is beautiful and very  very big.  There was so much to do on this ship until wee hours of the morning if you want.. Great shows and wonderful food and all the crew are so friendly.. and Helpful.. Our cabin was very comfy and our cabin steward was so nice.. The excursions we took were interesting.. we went to the green grotto.. I would chose something else .. It was a long trip to get  there and it was just so so. We did like the ruins at Cozumel .  It was a long trip to get there but it was worth it.. My big complaint of the ship time was that even though they announce NOT to save chairs at the pools.. well there were no places to sit and people did not come around the chairs. so they were just saving them for when they wanted them.. this is not good.. but every thing else was wonderful.. they even brought us a beautiful cake with champagne for our anniversary. Service was tops.
2.0	Sail Date: Apr 09, 2017 /	"Enjoyed the pools and entertainment.   The cruise itinerary was fine, but

probably would not recommend this ship because we were not happy with the size."
2.0	Sail Date: Apr 09, 2017 /	The dining experience and food and Entertainment very good. The cruise seemed overwhelmed overworked and not very happy. Lots items are shipped or broken in in operative. The fruit on the ship were merely and not very good but possibly because of the time of year.. Coke and ice cream dispensers for most of the time out of items or not working. The coke at the bars was more syrup and soda and not worth drinking. Small items as popcorn it shows robes 4 the rooms and decent bath towels we're hard to find the beds have sunken places in them and they put foam pads on top to try to compensate. I took a cruise on the Allure of the Seas, which is the sister ship and didn't have any problems whatsoever period big disappointment
4.0	Sail Date: Apr 09, 2017 /	The Oasis of the Seas is a destination unto itself, and was the best part of our cruise.  The ports (Labadee, Jamaica, Cozumel) were forgettable.  The food was really nice with wonderful service, the activities were fun and the entertainment was spectacular.
4.0	Sail Date: Apr 09, 2017 /	"Hi guys, first off, just wanted to say congratulations on having such a great ship!

Providing pros and cons below.

 

Pros:

- Large ship, allows for plenty of space to not feel crowded.

- many pool areas and hot tubs that provided us enough areas to enjoy ourselves.

- friendly staff

- convenient food options.

- reasonably priced accommodations.

 

Cons:

- Communication enhancements needed.  Take a note from what Disney does.  They have an app once you are on the ship's wifi that is updated with daily info, events, and also allows for communication between people.  This is really the only big complaint I have. 

Without it, we are left with carrying around paperwork for event start times, or guessing at where our friends are on the ship.

- Beverage plans can be confusing.  Access to the beverage dispensing machines should be clearly noted somehow (again, see the communications con above, can be included on a map of the ship, in the application).

- Kids Program a bit restrictive/not flexible.  You can’t just drop off kids at the club at anytime and leave.  There are established times for kids to attend.  Creates a bit of confusion while onboard as we had to be aware of the times to make sure we dropped off accordingly.  Should allow for more flexibility.

- Tracking/communication during kids club attendance is minimal.  They have no way to contact parents since there is no mobile phone/app that allows for communication (see note above related to comms).

 

Otherwise, had a great time, thanks!"
3.0	Sail Date: Apr 09, 2017 /	"Best part of cruise was my balcony, it was a double, with no neighbors on one side, very roomy.

Improvements needed:  Free perks- 1- specialty dining (poor quality steak) other diners that ordered the same steak got better quality (I can tell the difference between a real filet mignon (petite size) and a full size that was thin like 1/4 inch. Two sides to share (One dollop of mashed potato and 6 spears of asparagus).  Shrimp cocktail was large shrimps but didn't taste fresh.  It's only worth the $15.40 tip they charged us. 

2- Spa treatment,  30 minutes, not even worth the $22.00 they charged us. 

3- Johnny Rockets, not fresh hamburger, frozen-preshaped.  I've eaten at Johnny's many times, I know the difference. 

4- Beverage package,  could only get soda, since we don't drink soda, we asked if we can get water, they said ""NO"" only soda.  I took one soda and get it to a friend.  

Last of all, we didn't fair well with so many people, (6500) so we won't be traveling on big ships again, we are sticking to smaller ships.  Embarkation and debarkation with horrible."
5.0	Sail Date: Apr 09, 2017 /	"We thought that with it being such a big ship it'd be hard to meet people but we were wrong, we met and hung out with a bunch of people.

Overall we had a great experience and would highly recommend it."
3.0	Sail Date: Apr 02, 2017 /	We never sailed on Royal and never on a big ship.  We were in amazement at the start.  If you have never been on a big ship it has its UPS and downs from the get go.  Be ready to walk and stand for things and get pushed around by people who fail to remember vacation doesn't mean vacation from manners.  Windjammer is a complete mess!! NO organization at all! There is NO rhyme to the madness at all.  They close things down WAY to early for such a huge ship that has 6000 people looking for something to do.  The coke machines always broke down on our cruise.  I think they need more than what they have to really allow the ability to move around the ship instead of going to one place thats always a pain..windjammer then deck 5 where pictures ect are being done.  If you do anytime and do NOT pick a time there is no telling where you will sit! Pick a time and u may get the same seats possibly.  Im not going to say we had a bad time at all its just not the ship for us going fwd.  Its a wonderful ship just be patient or be prepared to tell people where to go LOL.
5.0	Sail Date: Apr 02, 2017 /	the ship is awesome, so much to do you will never be bored.  great activities for all ages, great broadway style shows and never once did any of the bartenders 'cheat' us on our drinks!
5.0	Sail Date: Mar 26, 2017 /	I appreciate all the attention from crew and ship cleanliness.  The showmanship of the entertainment was very entertaining.  The wait staff at pool areas were attentive to all cruisers.
5.0	Sail Date: Mar 26, 2017 /	This trip is beyond my expectations. I definitely would do it again in future. Food onboard is not very various but I can accept it. Dessert is very delicous. Next time I would take my parents with me taking this cruise. It's a best way taking your vacation and relax yourself.
5.0	Sail Date: Mar 26, 2017 /	"A cruise on Royal Caribbean's ""Oasis of the Seas"" is worth every penny spent.  The ship is magnificent, the food is superb, and the entertainment is incredible!  The ports of call were beautiful, but there was more than enough to do on the ship to never leave it.  Walking in the ship's Central Park made one forget that he/she was at sea.  Listening to music and relaxing before dinner was enchanting.  Walking down the Boardwalk was reflective of wiling away lazy afternoons and nights at the beach.  Seeing the full-length Broadway musical ""Cats,"" being awed by the high dives and synchronized swimming in the Aqua-Theatre, rocking with the headliner entertainer Joel Mason, experiencing the unbelievable talent in the ""Come Fly with Me"" production, and being reminded of the creative writings of Hans Christian Andersen in the spectacular ice show ""Frozen in Time"" were more than worth the price of the cruise.  The quality of the food and the service by the wait staff in the Silk Dining Room was comparable to four-star or five-star restaurants.  The food was delicious with a remarkable array from which to choose each night.  With several thousand guests onboard, we were concerned about long lines and congested areas, but we were pleasantly surprised at the ease of moving around the ship and gaining access to all the activities we wanted to do.  The food service areas are located throughout the ship and allow an atmosphere of space and relaxed dining.  Pools and hot tubs are also easily accessible and are designed to seem less crowded than those on other ships.  Walking of the decks at night and being able to see the stars and enjoy the quiet beauty of its vastness made a lasting impression on us.  Crew members truly seemed to want guests to enjoy their vacation to the utmost.  We would recommend this ship to anyone wanting a memorable cruise, but we especially recommend it to families because there are so many experiences offered to people of all ages."
4.0	Sail Date: Mar 26, 2017 /	Over all the cruise was great. The house keeping service was amazing and very friendly. Dean and Kayla in the Icon restaurant made for the best dining experience, we continued to sit in their section. Not too many lines on board at the bars but ran out of some liquors on the last day so we had to go to other bars. It would have been nice to have an adult only pool or adult only hours while sailing. The windjammer breakfast buffet was good but would have been better to have a different variety (themes like mexican, italian, etc) daily rather than the same items day to day. Made it to all the ports. Boarding and departing processes went smooth and loved that they partner with goportcanaveral.com for transportation to and from the port.
5.0	Sail Date: Mar 26, 2017 /	"I really enjoyed everything about the cruise. During a 7 day cruise I had taken several years ago, by the 5th day I was ready to get off the ship, but when the last day had come while on this cruise, I wanted to stay at least 3 more days.  It was wonderful !!!

The Manager and staff of The Windjammer were awesome!!!"
3.0	Sail Date: Mar 19, 2017 /	"Nice large ship but some of staff very lackadaisical. Staff would be standing around talking among themselves or just ignoring people especially in Boleros and Windjammer. Saw a couple of the staff actively flirting and touching. 

Some of service desk staff were very ineffective and lacked customer service skills."
5.0	Sail Date: Mar 19, 2017 /	Turning 50 sounded dreadful. 14 months before the dreaded day, I booked a cruise. Turning 50 while sailing through the Caribbean sounded less painful. Oh boy was it!!  It turned out to be the trip of a lifetime aboard Royal's Oasis of the Seas. My sister and I shared an ocean front balcony on deck 6. It was convenient to everything. Stops in Nassau, St. Thomas and Saint Maarten were perfect. We came home with Jewelry from Nassau. Wonderful memories of the perfect beach day on a perfect beach on st. Thomas. A humidor full of handrolled cigars from St. Maarten. It was such a grand adventure that we booked another cruise for October.
3.0	Sail Date: Mar 19, 2017 /	I enjoyed the zip line, flow rider and rock wall however I felt the service was no where as good as I have received on the freedom of the seas as well as monarch of the seas.. the quality of food was definitely not as good... pretty disappointed after spending $4300 for a vacation... but I would still use Royal carribean anyway... definitely will NEVER book through  again.. it was a disaster from the beginning.. nothing but problems
5.0	Sail Date: Mar 19, 2017 /	The cruise itself was pretty awesome. The only thing we did not like was the shore excursion to Buccanner Beach. It was very dirty and was basically sitting at a marina. Very disappointed in that exclusion. Everything else was awesome..especially pearl island!
3.0	Sail Date: Mar 19, 2017 /	"Very nice ship, but to big. Nearly 6000 people on this ship and found a lot of areas to crowded. Not enough staff to handle the passengers and the staff seemed stressed. 

 

Many places to eat at around the ship at no additional cost to you. 

 

The ultimate drink package is worth the money is you like to drink, plus it includes bottle water which was nice to take ashore, coffees, fresh squeezed OJ, smoothies, plus some other discounts."
4.0	Sail Date: Mar 19, 2017 /	cruising the eastern caribbean was terrific. Ship restaurants served great food with efficient service. Shows were entertaining and accessible even without reservations. Pools and hot tubs were great too and available activities meant there was always something to do. The low point for us was boarding on sailing date and disembarking at the end. Lines were long and slow, especially on initial boarding. We used the direct to the plane for our luggage but still stood around to leave the ship.
5.0	Sail Date: Mar 19, 2017 /	"I've been on Carnival, Norwegian and another smaller cruise line before, but nothing compared to RCL's Oasis of the Seas. The decor, the food, the activities all exceeded expectations. The full ""Cats"" broadway show (with the set and everything!) was great. This ship even had an ice skating rink!

 

Would definitely recommend this ship (and RCL in general) to others. 

 

My only two complaints are that the crowd is mostly senior citizens and families, so as a single 20-something or 30-something, the nightlife and activities may be a bit underwhelming due to the lack of participants, but that's no fault of the cruise line itself. The second complaint is that the port of calls aren't really that impressive - but most cruise ships stop in the Bahamas and similar islands, so again, it's hard to attribute that to the cruise line itself."
3.0	Sail Date: Mar 12, 2017 /	"While I still remain a fan of Royal Caribbean and maintain they are the best of the cruise lines I have been on, (Princess, Celebrity, Norwegian) I came away from this latest cruise knowing RC could have done much better with only a few common sense changes.  The specialty dining restaurant food was exceptional and with the exception of 150 Central Park, the service was also great.  Coastal Kitchens was a big disappointment and not worth the extra cost.  It was haughty and the service people were cold, unfriendly and even abrasive with their comments regarding ordering coffee with my meal too early, and having too much.   It took forever to get it, and our waiter was informed three times the wait was intolerable.  (So was his lack of training)

Chops was the best dining experience, with Giovanni's a close second.  We ate at the dining room restaurant on our last night and the food and service was exceptional.

     As the ship was 100% occupied with over 6,000 passenger and 2,300 crew, the overall ""service"" was sorely lacking in many areas, including long lines at many areas, including bars, hot dog stand, (no chili-cheese dogs?, Guest Services, and 20 minute wait times to reach an operator on the phone.  While a rule exists of ""no saving chairs""; I never saw it enforced once.  My biggest consistent complaint is bartenders who aren't aware of their surroundings and don't have a clue when a person has been waiting to be served for 30 seconds or 10 minutes.  The drinks were excellent; feeling compelled to let the bartenders know who was next was not.

     Checking in went smoothly as we were early and had Priority status.  We received a complimentary bottle of champagne after purchasing the specialty dining package of 3 meals. NIce surprise.  

     The room was a Jr. Suite with plenty of space and a balcony.  We had our Mother-In-Law with us and a curtain separated us when changing and sleeping.  Plenty of storage room and a walk in closet.  No complaints here.

     The biggest problems were related to the 100% occupancy rate.  Clearly, no change in staffing was made to compensate for this occurrence.  Having nearly 9,000 people on board without the proper people to serve them is very frustrating.  Long lines were apparent everywhere.

     Stopping at Labadee is a waste of time, unless you have a lot of money for the overpriced attractions, or enjoy being bullied and intimidated by the local vendors hawking items that look as if they were from WalMart.  As a private island, you are truly captive to an experience where laying on the beach is the main attraction.

     Falmouth Jamica began with a ride to Dr. Caves beach, a private beach with an admission fee and additional fees for towels, chairs, umbrella, snorkel gear and various vendors hawking their wares, including marijuana joints.  This is a tourist trap as it is crowded and overpriced.  ($5.00 for a towel?)  Beach access nearby is free.  We rented scooters at the Cozumel port and found a private beach that included everything for just $15/person.  Most will try to tell you they don't accept credit cards when they do if pushed.

     Finishing on a positive note, the Oasis entertainment was outstanding.  The live comedy was very popular as was the Aqua Theatre diving show and Ice Skating.  The Headliner show, featuring a variety of talent including singing, dancing, amazing acrobatics and tremendous feats of physical strength was my favorite.  The ship was amazing for its size, cleanliness, amount of activities available, and layout; including a running/walking track that was 2.4 laps to the mile.  The exercise room had plenty of room and a variety of equipment.  I definitely recommend the specialty dining packages as the extra cost is well worth the experience.

     We took 2 bottles of wine and a 12 pack of unopened Coke on board with us without a problem."
5.0	Sail Date: Mar 12, 2017 /	This ship is great. Definitely will cruise on this ship again. Every large ship with a lot of people but we never had trouble finding a seat for meals.
4.0	Sail Date: Mar 12, 2017 /	"My husband and I cruised with my sister and her husband celebrating my husbands birthday and their anniversary. Our experience on the Oasis was wonderful. We would refer any and everyone to this ship. The crew was phenomenal! Each and everyone of them.

 

Only complaint is that my bank account was mistakenly charged twice for ship board expense account. But that is being resolved.

 

Things I would suggest improvements on: Excursion descriptions. We book our excursions through Royal to ensure we get what we pay for. However, we did find that two if the three excursions this trip, were not described accurately and though that may be the description given to Royal by excursion companies, I believe if Royal us going tobrecommend them, they Neeson to confirm their accuracy. 

 

Other than that we had a marvelous time. The Oasis of the Seas is beautiful and breathtaking 👍❤☑"
5.0	Sail Date: Mar 12, 2017 /	"Relaxing and all the fun things to do with my granddaughter and daughter.  
Loved the Casino.  The cabin attendant was the best ever.  So kind and Johny on the Spot.  Love room service - but... would like more of a variety."
5.0	Sail Date: Mar 12, 2017 /	"Favorite part was the ability to have free dining. Having 2 grandchildren that were teens and 4 adults eating when we wanted was great.

Activites provided for teens was great also.

What I would change is that we didn't know for 3 days which restaurants were on the my time meals till we searched it out..

Lines to activites were short as there were many.

In the beginning of trip we should be told what tips were and should choose what we want to give not see it on tv screen. People traveling with children should not be charged per child only per adults for tipping!!

That was way out of proportion to what it should be.

We enjoyed the cruise very much tho and are planning a holiday one

4.0	Sail Date: Mar 12, 2017 /	"Amazing top notch entertInment beyond what yoU would expect on a cruise...

Cats was as good as Broadway production, Diving and synchronized swimming was breathtaking, Frozen in time ice show over the top, as was all the special effects and acrobatics staged in the up up and away show.  Although meals may not be refined with drizzles and gourmet touches, the food  is always fresh, and plentiful. For active kids and Tweens, there is never a dull moment from skating and swimming to rock climbing, surfing, mini golfing, and zip lining. The ship is enormous and is brimming with things to do and corners to explore. Don't expect to see violin quartets though..the atmosphere is more vibrating in nature."
5.0	Sail Date: Mar 05, 2017 /	Everything about this trip was wonderful. Food, service, shows. Our cabin assistant, Romeo, went above and beyond - we needed new pillows - we went to dinner, and when we returned, new pillows were in place!
3.0	Sail Date: Mar 05, 2017 /	First time on one of the larger ships and not sure we liked it as well as the middle size. The service was generally slower, the bars were always full, specialty restaurants were very busy, more movement than we have experienced on previous cruise and it just wasn't as friendly as previous cruises. One thing we didn't care for was mixed drinks were really different from bartender to bartender.. Costal kitchen great idea but very slow service.
5.0	Sail Date: Mar 05, 2017 /	Lots to do on ship. Layout of ship is very nice, not hard to figure out. Many excellent shows. Fun things to do on board. The mini golf is a little tacky but we still enjoyed it. Be sure to book your shows ahead of time. Lots of people, but they handle it well. We ended up with my time dining, but we could reserve our time each night for the next night so we didn't have to wait in line. Food was excellent, except for pastries.
5.0	Sail Date: Mar 05, 2017 /	Everything on the ship and off the ship was fantastic.  Was nothing that I could even come close to complaining about.  Was the best cruise we have ever done.

Need improvements in---need more variety in different cuisines, never saw pasta stations, need oriental stations, need more icecream varieties. Need popcorn station for afternoon near card room.

Ladies Bathrooms did not have seat covers. 

Good experience overall."
4.0	Sail Date: Feb 26, 2017 /	The shows were all excellent and very enjoyable.  Loved the show, Cats, as the dancers and singers were very professional.  The diving show, awesome, the ice show, unbelievable, & the Ariel show great.  Everything was pretty well organized for having such a large number of passengers & staff.  Over all, we had a great time.

5.0	Sail Date: Feb 26, 2017 /	"Super individuals doing a super job no matter where on the ship one ventured.  Food was outstanding!  Aqua show was amazing !   Skating show on rough seas was also amazing !  CATS a winner too.  Labadee, Haiti truly spectacular!  Jamaica man, ""Treasures of Ochos Rios"" was a bit uncomfortable as there was no lunch offered by the tour operator, while on the bus for over 5 hours, and over 400 stairs, and yet one of the most expensive excursions offered,  Cozumel's shopping experience grand !"
5.0	Sail Date: Feb 26, 2017 /	"Even though this is one of the biggest ships afloat, we never felt ""crowded"" and were able to see all the shows.   Booking ahead is the key here.   The Marketplace dining room was well supplied with a great variety of food choices.   Our dining room experience was excellent.   The waiters knew our preferences and took great care of us.   The food was excellent without huge portions that no one can eat.   Our cabin overlooking the Boardwalk was adequately sized and clean.   No complaints whatsoever!"
4.0	Sail Date: Feb 26, 2017 /	Surprised that the big ship did not make you feel crowded.  They handled all the passengers very well, plenty of places to eat without feeling overwhelmed.  Only problem was when checking out the last day.  After a certain point in time, they wanted everyone off and just told all of the last 20 numbers to leave at once creating a huge backup in luggage retrieval and customs.  Numerous things to do around the ship, but not many free activities scheduled so you had to keep yourself occupied (not too hard).
3.0	Sail Date: Feb 26, 2017 /	Ship is very nice and well kept.   Extremely clean but way to big for my liking.  You better like a lot of walking as venues can be quite far apart.   Food in Dining room is very good but not so much in the Wind Jammer.   Always crowded and you always feel like you are being rushed to eat you food.   Didn't like the announcement asking that you get up when done eating and move quickly so others could sit down.
4.0	Sail Date: Feb 26, 2017 /	"Entertainment was great. Food in the dining areas was top notch. The Windjammer was not as good. Average

The pools were beautiful and the Oasis has 4. My only complaint, children were in all 4 pools and it would have been easier if parents w/children were directed to certain kid friendly pools. Adults like to have fun and it was inappropriate at times and hard to swim with kids taking over in all pools, no supervision."
1.0	Sail Date: Feb 26, 2017 /	Had a great time and food was excellent and many choices,  plenty to do on this cruise.  The late shows I feel that could do batter,  but is ok I am not to much into Broadway shows. 2 of everything which is great,  plenty of place to eat. Will definitely go again..
4.0	Sail Date: Feb 26, 2017 /	"I loved cruising with Royal.  Oasis of the Seas is a gorgeous ship!  With so many people on board it is a bit difficult to get used to though.  Despite the fact everyone disperses very well on a ship this size, there are still times when it is noticeable.  The pool decks get pretty crowded, and the chairs are right on top of each other.  This ship could certainly use less specialty restaurants and more pool space.  We found that when the pools were full, they were FULL.  The solarium was our favorite area of the ship for sitting out in the sun for sure.  Much less of a crowd there.

 

The staff was outstanding!  Very courteous and helpful when needed.  Rock climbing, Zip Line, and the Surf machines are so cool.  We didn't use them more than once but still awesome. 

 

Loved all of the shows aside from Cats which just wasn't that appealing to us.  It was very long and just not that exciting.  On that note I would like to see more options for shows.  The Comedy shows booked so fast, but we still managed to get into 2 of them without reservations.  VERY funny.

 

I could go on forever about positive things, but I will leave with one more critical comment.  The food was excellent, HOWEVER you cannot alter what they are offering.  My wife likes things very plain, and you would think that this would make things simple, but this was not the case.  All of their sandwiches in the cafe promenade for example are premade with some odd sauces on them.  For me I enjoyed them, but if you want just a basic turkey sandwich they cannot do it.  The same goes for dinner.  something delicious might be smothered in something you don't care for, so you are forced to try something else.  I know many people enjoy this, but it's not so great for picky eaters.  At the cost of a cruise I feel they should be able to cater to custom orders.  Especially when boasting the size of the culinary staff so much.

 

I will be back despite these things though!

 

Happy Cruising"
3.0	Sail Date: Feb 26, 2017 /	everything was great except that in the windjammer there isn't any kind of organization,everyone bumps with the food into other people, the space is not big enough, the waitress don't help the handicap, in order to get a table one of us had to stay at the table while the other went to get their food.  at the end when leaving the ship like in other they give the handicapped priority here the handicapped were left for the end,when I told one of the attendance that my husband needed a wheelchair she was very rude, overall these things upset us.
4.0	Sail Date: Feb 26, 2017 /	"Shows and entertainment were outstanding. On show bookings, book EARLY (and on line) and arrive at the venue at least 1/2 hour early if you want a good seat and good seat selection. Overall service, good.  Quality and personnel performance about the same as on other RC ships.

 

Hats off to Tina Lorusso!"
5.0	Sail Date: Feb 26, 2017 /	"Organized and fun time with the Royal Caribe! Gang! Always their to help or direct you when you are in transit to a show or dinner. You never have to look for help they just seem to appear.

Great shopping. I don't like to shop but found myself checking out some of the sea day deals."
5.0	Sail Date: Feb 26, 2017 /	Terrific cruise. Very friendly staff. Enjoyed the entertainment. Food was good and Chops Steakhouse was great. Lots of activities for children as well as adults. Will sail with Oasis of the Seas again.
5.0	Sail Date: Feb 26, 2017 /	The ship was so big it never felt overly busy. We were always able to find an open hot tub and a chair when we wanted to sit outside.  We were over the boardwalk which was a little louder than we would have liked but not bad. The ship was also really rocky the days at sea but all of the ports were amazing.  The room was fairly spacious and the bed was really comfortable. We will definitely be going on another one, hopefully soon!
4.0	Sail Date: Feb 19, 2017 /	Love the Central Park area for relaxing and breakfast. The water show is amazing. I wish the broadway show was different.  None of liked Cats (we sat through the 1st half on our first cruise 2 years ago) but skipped it completely this time.  Grease, Wicked, Mama Mia, Phantom of the Opera would have been a much better choice. The comedy show was okay, but would have liked to see another comedian and another show.  We were lucky to book it this time (the prior cruise we missed it) The food overall was good. Disappointed in the Lobster Bisque (no one in the family cared for it).  The staff was very friendly, keep ship in tip top shape.
2.0	Sail Date: Feb 19, 2017 /	Cruise was fine. Cruise,com told us we'd have a $250 on-board credit. Didn't happen. Last year we were supposed to get a credit card credit after the cruise. Didn't happen. Won't be using them again.
5.0	Sail Date: Feb 19, 2017 /	It is hard to pick my favorite thing about this cruise. We relaxed and enjoyed the pool area, they have a lot of pools. The food is amazing. We ate in the dining room most nights and the servers and food were exceptional. We also enjoyed a dinner at 150 Central Park and wow you have to try the lobster gnocchi. Johnny Rockets is always good. The shows are top notch, you can't go wrong with any of them. There is always something to see and do.
4.0	Sail Date: Feb 19, 2017 /	The favorite part of my cruise was enjoying the ship and the service. Everyone tried very hard to please.  I believe that the crew was a little short handed but tried very hard to take care of everyone.  Food was very good in dining room and around the ship.  Our 3rd time on Oasis and still pleased.  Little disappointed with CATS.  Otherwise enjoyed entertainment very much.  Cabin/Stateroom Attendant Seymour Holliness Room # 11585 was outstanding as was our Dining room server at Table# 400 Darcey.
3.0	Sail Date: Feb 19, 2017 /	All shows were excellent especially the ice show. Don't miss it. I was not a big fan of having to make reservations for shows and dinner and having to coordinate all the times together. Would much rather prefer the 'old' way of set time dining and open seating for shows for first come first serve seats. More waiter service needed at Laberdee beach. Overall an excellent ship, service, food and entertainment.
4.0	Sail Date: Feb 12, 2017 /	Liked the room, the layovers were sort of a waste of time, they seemed just an excuse to say we went somewhere.  If you ask someone to review something, it is not to your advantage to constantly critique it
4.0	Sail Date: Feb 12, 2017 /	My husband and I took a honeymoon cruise on the Oasis of the Seas!  The boat is huge, and beautiful.  The outside balcony is great and spacious.  Plenty of food on the ship, although have to pay for alt of.  Ice cream and Johnnie Rocket not include in fair.  We left out of Port Canaveral and most of the passengers were at least 70 years old and above.  Will probably not cruise from this port again.  Jeannie at the Japanese restaurant was outstanding.
4.0	Sail Date: Feb 12, 2017 /	when I called Royal Caribbean for help I never felt important to them as a past customer.  Sherri always tried to help as best she could and always returned phone calls. I. Appreciated that as no other agents from your agency ever did!  The ship was somewhat worn and some very unfriendly personnel. The ship did have a lot to do and never felt over crowed. The photo dept was especially not customer friendly. They mocked the poses we wanted and when we did them they didn't print them , thus I didn't buy as many pictures as I would have! Ship needs updating, especially things like worn and holes in pillow cases.
5.0	Sail Date: Feb 12, 2017 /	"Very nice ship and the best ""cruise food"" I've ever had.  I highly recommend the Oasis.  Everyone on board was very nice and attentive.  Loved the self-serve ice cream and frozen yogurt."
5.0	Sail Date: Feb 12, 2017 /	Food was wonderful. Service was great. Oasis of the Seas has everything you might want. Casino was a lot of fun and made 6 fabulous friends. Shops were a little expensive. Diet coke was expensive but what I expected. The garden on the ship was beautiful. 1st time I've ever see a full basketball court on a ship. Lots of room to sun bath.
4.0	Sail Date: Feb 05, 2017 /	The Oasis of the Seas 7 day Eastern Caribbean cruise was a favorite of ours.  The ship was fantastic with many things to do, and after a day or so we got used to the size and number of people on board.  We enjoyed excursions to Trunk Bay beach and Orient beach.  These excursions were great, although the meeting points for the excursions could have been better organized.  The on-board entertainment was top notch!  We really enjoyed it.  Staff was friendly and took good care of us.  The internet service was hit and miss - some times we didn't get texts until the day after they were sent.  Overall we enjoyed this cruise line and the Oasis of the Seas.
5.0	Sail Date: Feb 05, 2017 /	Highly recommend this cruise to everyone!  Our highlight of the cruise are the activities, shows, great food, pleasant staff, and Central Park.  Just Awesome.
3.0	Sail Date: Feb 05, 2017 /	The ship is very large with lots of great entertainment and the food is average. The food could be better and the shows must be booked in advance if you want to see them.
5.0	Sail Date: Feb 05, 2017 /	The Oasis class ships are amazing. A few years ago I was on the Allure of the Seas, and now going on the Oasis I was similarly impressed. Everything from the ship, to the staff, to the activities and entertainment were all outstanding. One can always find something to complain about, but when you take everything into consideration, this was a phenomenal cruise. If you haven't been on an Oasis class ship...go soon!
3.0	Sail Date: Feb 05, 2017 /	"Lots of activities, in fact, a little too ""busy"" for my taste.  Not recommended for the 50+ crowd.  Dining experience did not measure up to previous cruises.  Very disappointed that the ""Cats"" performance we made reservations for was cancelled due to a cast illness.  That was one of the reasons we booked that particular cruise.  There should have been an understudy available to step in."
5.0	Sail Date: Feb 05, 2017 /	My favorite part was the dining room, for breakfast lunch and dinner.  The dining crew was wonderful and were happy to serve. It's always nice to be served by people who enjoy what they do.  The boat itself was beautiful.  the ice skating show was very very well done.  There's so much more, but it's hard to get everything in.
5.0	Sail Date: Jan 29, 2017 /	"My husband and I have never been on one of the huge ships so when the opportunity came to try it for relatively cheap, we jumped on it. This particular cruise stopped in Labadee, Haiti; Falmouth, Jamaica; and Cozumel, Mexico. There were three sea days in this itinerary. Overall, we had an amazing time and are very happy with this cruise. 

Port Canaveral: As far as ports go, it is easy to access and not too far from Orlando, however, it did not seem very organized. In fact, the day of departure wascrazy. We rented a car from Avis at the airport and returned it to their location at Port Canaveral. The rental car companies all over shuttles to the ships. We got there extra early and took the shuttle. We had to wait an hour and a half in the parking lot at the cruise terminal because there was so much traffic and confusion. This is not on the part of the rental car company and due to the lack of organization at the port. I overheard other guests saying this ship was  recently moved to Port Canaveral and that they did not have the ""kinks"" worked out yet. So please give yourself plenty of time to avoid any stress on the day of departure. Likewise on the day you return to port. We waited in very long lines for US Customs but it do go relatively quickly.  

Room: We chose a B1 category stateroom 8723 that overlooked the Boardwalk. I wanted to say thank you to other reviewers who posted the room lay-outs. We choose a room with the bed by the balcony and not by the closet. There is plenty of storage but I did run out of hangers. You may want to bring some extras if you are the type who likes to hang all your clothing. No complaints about the room, bed, or bathroom. We were very happy with this stateroom. There was a special for booking that category stateroom: free soda package for two, free lunch/dinner at Johnny Rockets for up to four, and a free rock climbing session. The great part of the room is we had a wonderful view of the Aqua Theater and actually watched the show right from our balcony. If you do not stay up late, this may not be the location for you as the sound from the Aqua Theater can be quite loud. General noise from the Board Walk was negligible. Our room steward, Dmytro, was amazing. He will take care of you. Period. I intend to write a letter to Royal Caribbean praising him after I write this review.  

Entertainment: Overall, the best entertainment I have seen on a cruise. We have only been on 6 but this topped it all. I do recommend that you use the cruise planner to make reservations to the shows before you leave. We were able to secure reservations to the comedy show, Come Fly with Me, Frozen in Time, and Cats before we left. However, I was only able to get one ticket for the comedy show. It ""sold out"" that fast. With that said, the Cruise Compass on the first day does say to go to Guest Services to make show reservations as soon as you get on board but what they didn't tell you (and we figured out by chance) was that you can make the reservations right on the TV in your state room. I was easily able to make the second reservation for the comedy show minutes after arriving in our room. Familiarize yourself with the TV options. We found this useful extremely helpful. I forgot to print out our calendar to keep track of our reservations but quickly found out each person's calendar and reservations are available on the TV. Great feature! 

As others have stated, the Aqua Theater show Oasis of Dreams is frequently canceled due to weather. (It is a great show and worth it). The first night it was canceled because it was raining and windy when we left Port Canaveral. It was rescheduled and a message was sent (via your state room ""email"" on the TV) stating the days/times it was rescheduled. The Come Fly with Me was canceled as well because of technical difficulties. While we were disappointed, the replacement show (an act with Ronn Lucas, renowned ventriloquist) was so damn funny! Frozen in Time was AMAZING and so was Cats. The actors are extremely talented. The actress who played Grizabella has a voice that will literally bring you to tears. She is that good. The Comedy Show was hilarious too. We highly recommend those shows! Of note, if you are unable to make a reservation, the staff open up the venue to standby guests 5 minutes before the show. So, to those with reservations, you need to be there at least 15 minutes early and to those without reservations, standby seating is opened up to those who are there first come, first serve.  

The other smaller acts were amazing too. Particularly, the Sweet Sounds Duo. If you like classical music (and even if you don't, you probably will enjoy listening to them), they will definitely impress you. They play a lot in Central Park and by accident, we happened to schedule a reservation at Giovanni's when they were performing. If you plan on dining in the specialty restaurants, look to see if they are performing and try to schedule your reservations around that time. Wonderful experience! I can't speak to any other venues like the clubs, bars, etc. We didn't go in those places but did see others having a blast when we went by.  

Dining: We have never done the Specialty Dining on a cruise but were curious about it so we stopped in to look at the menu the first day of the cruise. They had a special going and I highly recommend that you stop in the first day to check for any specials. The one we purchased was three visits to any of the Specialty Restaurants for $85 a person. GREAT deal when you look at what it costs for one person. We ended up going to Giovanni's once and Chops Grille twice. We were so happy with the food and service. Allow two hours for dinner at these restaurants. They do not rush you and want to make sure you enjoy your time there.  

On the other nights, we ate in main dining in the Grande Dining room on deck 4. Also another thank you to reviewers here, I emailed RC dining before the cruise and requested a table for 2 again. Each time I have done this, we have received our requested table. If you are more extroverted, you probably would enjoy eating dinner with others but we tend to keep to ourselves. One other advantage is you don't have to wait for 6-8 other people to decide what they want to eat. The food in main dining was very good and the service was great as well. For breakfast we ate at the Wind Jammer and the food was decent. It is your typical buffet style breakfast. Good variety of foods are offered. There are quite a few places you can eat. We frequented these places and also Sorrento's. Love the pizza on demand feature. :)  

Sports: The ship is equipped with a sports court (best one we have seen), a mini golf course (eh), five ping pong tables (in good shape with brand new paddles), sports pools, two rock walls, two Flow Riders, a zip line (goes over the Board Walk), and other things. The reason I gave the mini gold course an ""eh"" is because the golf balls were not real (hard foam) and the clubs were for someone who was 4' tall. They did not offer different sized clubs. This is not a big deal but when you are super competitive like we are, it does factor into the equation when one of us beats the other. LOL We did not go in the pools or hot tubs but will say there are plenty of them around.  

Neighborhoods: There are seven different neighborhoods on this ship. Central Park was by far my favorite. I spent as much time in there as I could. I cannot believe that is on a cruise ship! My advice is to explore and check each one out. Definitely neat and different from any other ship I have been on.  

I did not reserve spa services so cannot speak to that this time. Shopping was good on the ship. There are some high end stores on the ship (especially for women's handbags) but also decent priced goods too. I bought souvenir t-shirts for $10. Make sure to check your merchandise for any defects. I bought a shirt and didn't notice there was a hole in it until I took off the tags. I had no problems exchanging for another shirt. 

Shore Excursions: We booked two in Labadee and really enjoyed this stop. We booked the Snorkel Safari (tour code QLB2) and the Jet Skis (tour code ZL03). On the Snorkel Safari, they take you out on a boat to a reef and you have about an hour to explore. The reef was beautiful and was teeming with all different types of coral. There were fish and other marine life but not in abundance like in Coco Cay, Bahamas. (The area is over fished.) Still very beautiful and a great place to snorkel. The guides were great and would point out various marine life and if they were safe to handle (for both us or the marine life), they would gently pick up and show it to us. The snorkel equipment was good quality too. No issues there. We both drive our own Jet Skis after and if you have never done this and you're not afraid of speed, you HAVE to do this. I was beaming like a little kid. I started in the back but was quickly moved up to the front at the first stop. (People who go faster are in the front and slower people are put in the rear to not hold anyone up). So much fun!!!! The only part I didn't like is at one one the stops, locals kayaked over to us and tried to sell us stuff (while we are on Jet Skis). That wasn't part of the tour but something they did to try to help the locals.  

Speaking of locals, outside of the tourist area this is a very poor area. The merchants in the main shop are not pushy but as soon as you walk outside the main shop to the lines of shops, the locals can be very pushy about getting you to come in their shops and look at their goods. On the plus side, you can barter a great deal on items if you can deal with the pushiness. We did buy from both the main shop and the locals to help support the area.  

Falmouth Jamaica: We did the Dunns River Falls and Jamaican Bobsled tour tour code FY25). LOVED it! Note to those going on this tour: wear a bathing suit or other swim wear and only carry what you need to the Falls. Leave everything else on the bus or in a locker. I can't tell you how many sunglasses, phones, etc fell into the current while we were there. If you take a camera or phone, make sure it is waterproof and has a strap. You are climbing the falls and will get soaked. Also, buy water shoes with some decent tread for this. These are a must. A videographer goes with each tour group and you can purchase the video and the photos they take (all on a CD) for $40 (cash only). If you want this, please bring the money with you. We didn't know this and didn't bring enough money to the falls to get the CD. Also of note, the videographer noticed we did not fill out the slip for the video and approached us separately. He was trying to negotiate on the price and was willing to give it to us for much less so keep that in mind when you are purchasing it. We didn't purchase it because we wanted to make sure the driver and tour guide received a good tip. The tour guide at Dunns River Falls will expect a tip as well. We had Tammy and she was worth it. Other tour groups kept looking over to ours because we were having so much fun. After we did this, we went over to Mystic Mountain for the Bobsled portion. The lifts were broken so the bus drove us to the top via a private access road. You have the option of being joined to another sled or going down individually, whatever suits your comfort level. There are signs that state going too fast endangers you and the person in from too you. Not to worry, they allow ample space in between you and the sleds that go before and after you. I asked the attendant if I could go ""wide open"" and he said ""of course....drive it like you stole it."" And so my husband I did just that. We went individually and we both had the sleds wide open the whole time. Fast, a bit jerky and rough but fun as hell! We were smiling ear to ear after that ride! 

 

Cozumel, Mexico: We did the Jeep to Punta Sur Eco-Park (tour code CZ4P). This is quite frankly the only thing we were not pleased with the entire trip. The description of this reads exactly as follows ""Snorkel at an ecological preserve, visit a Mayan ruin, climb a lighthouse and relax on a beach. Explore a vibrant underwater world teeming with a wide variety of marine life (all gear included). Relax or play on Explora beach; a remote, white-sand beach, one of the best beaches in the country."" Now the facts. Most of the Jeeps are manual transmission. This was not an issue for us but for others, it may be. You don't get your own Jeep (unless you are a group of 4). We booked it thinking my husband and I would have our own Jeep. WRONG. They put you four to a Jeep and when we complained because it is clearly not stated in the description, the tour guide replied with ""that's how we do it."" We we offered our own Jeep if we paid more. We refused. We were put with another couple who thankfully was a pleasure to be with. If you get stuck with some idiots or those who do not want to share driving, you are frankly SOL. Also, the tops were on the Jeeps. What's the point of driving a Jeep if the top remains on? That was also disappointing and unfortunately, the disappointment did not stop there. The snorkel equipment was not the same quality gear that was used on the Snorkel Safari in Labadee, This equipment was terrible and many complained that their masks leaked, snorkels weren't working properly, etc. My favorite thing to do is snorkel and I read reviews on this and many said this was a great spot to snorkel. This had my very confused when we snorkeled right off the beach and all we had to look at was sea grass and the occasional bits of coral and fish. There was hardly any coral or fish and certainly no reef. This leads me to think we were not brought to the reef people discussed in other reviews. (Reviewers stated that location takes some time to swim to and our guide literally kept us right off shore). I will say the beach and lighthouse were wonderful but you are barely given any time to enjoy them. The Mayan Ruin is about the size of the shed and a disappointment if you have been to other ruin sites. The tour operator was Explora Caribe and we frankly were not impressed. I will be writing a letter to RC to complain about this shore excursion. Consider yourself warned if you are considering this tour.Aside from this experience, we had a great time and would recommend this cruise. Hopefully this review is helpful to those considering this cruise."
4.0	Sail Date: Jan 29, 2017 /	The at-sea portions of the cruise were our best remembrances, including Mah Jongg in the Card Room, the swimming pool and hot tubs, and the exercise room.  The entertainment was excellent, including CATS, the ice skating show, the comics, etc.  Unfortunately, there was insufficient information about the beach availability at Labadee, and children were allowed to run amok in the Card Room while players were trying to concentrate on their games. There is a children's program available.  Moreover, there were few organized activities for older guests.
4.0	Sail Date: Jan 29, 2017 /	my favorite part of cruise was live shows. the ice skating show was # 1. Some of the shows where in small rooms so not everyone can enjoy them.  The ship is beautiful and I would recommend it highly. Make sure you book your shows early or you may not get to enjoy them.
4.0	Sail Date: Jan 29, 2017 /	The entertainment was fantastic and the good was great..Shore excursions were Ok and YOU DID NOT HONOR YOUR $ 50 ON BOARD CREDITS . The staff was terrific
4.0	Sail Date: Jan 29, 2017 /	"VERY GOOD CRUISE, FOOD WAS GOOD  ENTRETAINMENT VERY GOOD

CABIN STEWARD WAS GREAT.  CABIN WAS VERY NICE  AND COMFORTABLE

WOULD HAVE LIKED MORE INFO ON PORTS VISITED"
4.0	Sail Date: Jan 29, 2017 /	The staff was great.  The shows were very good. Disembarking was a hassle could be done better.  Cost of water much too expensive, and the drinks are too high.  Cost of hifi is rediculous.
5.0	Sail Date: Jan 29, 2017 /	Everything was perfect.     The food was delicious and the ship was spotless.   The shows were excellent.      Everyone was extremely accommodating.  We were able to get off the ship with handicap scooters.
1.0	Sail Date: Jan 22, 2017 /	Do not book excursions through . They obviously don't know the difference between ship time and local time and then they refuse to refund your money
3.0	Sail Date: Jan 22, 2017 /	"Have cruised many times. Probably 30+   Disappointed with Quest...Volume of music and speakers in general were unbearable.  Asked attendant to please turn down, he turned them UP.  Many of us left, never saw the show.  Am finding that cruising is loosing it's class.  There used to be dress codes and people are becoming very rude.  From our cabin at night we found that teenagers were loud

and not controlled.  Had to close and seal our balcony door to try to shut out the noise."
4.0	Sail Date: Jan 22, 2017 /	"This was an excellent beginning to my retirement.  From beginning to end it was worry free.  Quick and easy embarkation.  We were worried about the size of the ship and the amount of passengers it carried but we never encountered any large lineups.  Upon arrival at the port it took only about 1/2 hour before we were on the ship.  Very well organized.

Would love to do it again."
5.0	Sail Date: Jan 22, 2017 /	"The neighborhood concept was interesting but the novelty wears off fast.  Hollowing out the middle of the boat means far less space for indoor pools and Jacuzzi. 

 

Food was great, and ride was smooth."
3.0	Sail Date: Jan 22, 2017 /	"Cruise personnel at all levels from the Captain to our room steward were outstanding. Dining in the main dining room was where our party of 9 got together

to share daily experiences. Food selection and quality there were excellent and were served with gracious attention for all our wants and needs.

Although we booked reservations for all our shows, we learned that it was best to arrive 30-45 before showtime to ensure a decent seat. Also several events for which we had reservations were cancelled or overbooked but we learned this when we arrived for the show. 

Although a frequent cruiser on Royal Caribbean, I will NEVER TRAVEL again on the Oasis. My next trip is the transatlantic on the Navigator. I've cruised the Freedom class before and love it.

EXCURSION: we took the Ultimate St John National Park and we were sorely disappointed. Bus from bay, up the road into the park.Driver pulled over at two viewpoints high above the bay but the rest was all wooded roads and a quick stop at a historic site. Definitely NOT worth the time or money."
5.0	Sail Date: Jan 22, 2017 /	The ship always had something to do even when the first couple days had high winds. The Solarium was very nice since we are now empty nesters and wanted to enjoy time without kids. It was nice that the ship had that area for just adults.
4.0	Sail Date: Jan 22, 2017 /	"I felt this ship was way too big and carried too many passengers(about 6500) for comfort. Friends had chosen it,and we wanted to go with them. It would not have been my choice. We waited months to hear if we could be seated with them. RC kept telling u it would be no problem, and it still never showed up on our itinerary. We were told to just check with the maitre'd on boarding. They put us at two tables of four,instead of one table of eight. We were assured it would be changed after the craziness of the first night. They kept promising the manager would talk to us. He never did. One night we ordered room service to be delivered between 8-8:30 because we were going off ship. We waited til 9. It never arrived. The line for room service was constantly busy,so we never spoke to anyone. We finally ran up to the buffet.

We spent way too much time waiting for elevators which were always full,or never stopped on our floor,or sometimes when they did-the doors never opened. There were never enough chairs on the deck. The eight of us never sat near each other on any day on a chair by the ice cold pools.Some days I had to circle the whole area twice to find one empty seat. Children were in every jacuzzi, in snorkel gear,with life jackets on, doing somersaults, with no parental supervision. A woman was so drunk in a pool, that she puked,and ten minutes later ,the pool was reopened. We had to stand around time after time at the Windjammer and Solarium buffets looking for a place to sit for two people. My friend had gotten her coffee and creamers and laid it down on a table,and went to grab breakfast, and when she returned, people were sitting in her seat. They handed her the coffee,and said ""Here, is this yours?""  People were ignorant at the buffet. One person had the nerve to take 10 lobster tails,(as I counted out LOUD, very loud) and there was a long long line waiting. When I got there , there were two left,and the people in line in back of me waited a long time for them to replace them.

The cabin was nice, we had a balcony overlooking the water, which was very relaxing. Had a lot of fun at the game shows and trivia contests.However, for winning, same as last year,they gave away a yellow highliter marker .Really? One night for winning,I did get a paper fan advertising Malibu Rum. For the price of this cruise, they could at least give a free drink coupon. The entertainment staff was great.

The water show was fabulous. My friends didn't get to see it because the weather was too windy,and they never had a make up night. We never saw Come Fly With Me due to mechanical problems. Also Cats was not shown in the same theater for whatever the problem. The Frozen on Ice show was also great. It was the only time the eight of us got tickets together for anything. Book your show times immediately after booking your cruise. We were unable to book the comedy show,but they did have an open one Saturday night,I guess for the people who hadn't had the opportunity to see it. They comedians were very good. The headline singer was fabulous! Do not miss his show. We had a great waitress in the dining room.Very personable,and she knew all our names and likes very quickly. We were off to the side,so the two nights they had big to-dos with the wait staff in the large area,we only heard the announcements,but never saw what was going on.

For snacks, the pizza place and hot dog place were always open. We grabbed a sandwich for lunch one day in the free coffee shop place,but it was all bread and a slice of roast beef. We ended up getting a slice of pizza after it. The rising bar was fun.I wanted to go on the carousel, but it was never opened every time we went down there. Last cruise we really enjoyed the guitarist that was in the pub. This time, even though he was listed in the flyer every night, when we went,he was never there. Maybe he was on vacation or something. We did love Chester at the piano bar, and were there most nights. I was surprised to see he used canned music (synthesizer,drum beats, etc)along with his piano playing.  This isn't typical for a piano bar pianist. 

We weren't able to spend the day in the Bahamas due to weather conditions. The ship kept going and we docked in San Juan from 4-10 pm. So we missed a beach day. We had a great day at Coki Beach in St Thomas,and another beach day in St Maarten at Mullett Bay. Unfortunately,the waves and riptides prohibited us from getting into the water that day. But the weather is nobody's fault.

I think I am done with cruises. Next vacation will definitely be at an all inclusive resort on an island."
4.0	Sail Date: Jan 22, 2017 /	The ship was nice and the crew friendly, but 9000 people make for a big crowd. The shore excursions were disappointing: wait times were exorbitant, boat not so nice (dirty, loud, and had to sit inside), and corals were dead.
4.0	Sail Date: Jan 22, 2017 /	Upon sailing we were informed that visit to Nassau was cancelled due to strong winds and rough waters.  Puerto Rico was added but we didn't arrive there until 5:30pm will departure time of 11pm.  It didn't bother me as I have been there before but many people were upset as it was already dark outside and some excursions were cancelled.  The first Aqua show was cancelled due to rough weather.  The second Cats show and the Come Fly with Me shows were cancelled due technical difficulties. The departure process in the terminal was a nightmare as our hotel shuttle bus didn't show up for 1 hour due to traffic congestion.  At the same time as our ship arrival, there was also Disney, and Norwegian Epic.  Needles to say, massive amounts of people and vehicles.  First time on the ship and didn't mind the massive size as there is a lot to do.  Booked another cruise for next January 2018.
5.0	Sail Date: Jan 22, 2017 /	Beautiful ship, lots of eating venues and space for reading or just talking with friends. There were over 6400 people on board that week and the only day I felt crowded was the day that it was too windy and cool for people to go out to the pool.
5.0	Sail Date: Jan 15, 2017 /	Overall the ship is fantastic. It is very clean and for the most part the crew was very friendly. The only part we would mark down is the food especially in the main dining room where it was sub par at best.
2.0	Sail Date: Jan 15, 2017 /	Shows were dynamite!  Too many people.  Tripping over small children and strollers.  Too many places to spend additional $$$$$$$.  One drink was $12.   Don't drink enough to get the drink package. No wine package available.
3.0	Sail Date: Jan 15, 2017 /	Lot of money for the star status for the extras! Check to see if there has been a update to the room before booking. We have done the Allure and oasis and not a fan of the cost/extras. Nice ship, just ready for some updating!  Also more bar staff as waiting for a water or drink was very long!
4.0	Sail Date: Jan 15, 2017 /	"Cruising on the Oasis of the Seas was enjoyable most of the time and frustrating some of the time. My favorite part of the cruise was my zip line experience as I have always wanted to attempt it and I was finally able to achieve my goal. It was frustrating to have to ""make reservations"" to see the entertainment productions and the ""my time dining"" did not work out as smooth as I have experienced it before. I am sure that both issues were due to the number of people the ship accommodates and since I am not a fan of large crowds I consider that just to be a matter of personal preference to cruise on smaller ships. Overall the variety of things to do on the ship was just right."
5.0	Sail Date: Jan 15, 2017 /	the entertainment was first class; iceskaters, divers, musicians. although there were over 5000 cruisers on board it rarely felt overcrowded.  the food was mostly great, only one bad entree one night.  the staff was very helpful and courteous. lots of places to see and things to do. the ship was the destination.
5.0	Sail Date: Jan 15, 2017 /	Great variety of restaurants!  Good Shows!  The ship is a destination in itself!  Staff is friendly.  Have been on many cruises, and this is one of our favorite ships!
5.0	Sail Date: Jan 15, 2017 /	We have cruised several times before from different cruise companies, this is our first time with Royal Caribbean and it has exceeded all of my expectations.
5.0	Sail Date: Jan 15, 2017 /	The shows on the ship are spectacular! The food is also top notch. The services and cleaniless exceeded expectations. Would recommend this cruise to anyone.
5.0	Sail Date: Jan 15, 2017 /	We traveled as an extended family with 16 people and had a great time.  Great food, shows, entertainment and activities.  Would do it again in a minute!!
4.0	Sail Date: Jan 15, 2017 /	Long time cruisers. Loved the ship, our stateroom was smaller than normal..weirdly narrow, with closet by bed, hard to access. Ship was great, so much to see and do. Aqua show was super! Get there early!! Solarium was fabulous, lots of chairs and wicker furniture and a small restaurant for breakfast and lunch like the Windjammer. The different food venues took the pressure off the Windjammer and made good food accessible always. The Promenade is super and enjoyed the parade. My Time Dining is a nightmare as always, you don't have a reservation really, don't expect to be sat when you reserved, the lines could be horrible, and the wait anywhere from 10-30 minutes for ok food. The wait staff tried, but dinner took forever!!! My time dining just doesn't work. Have tried it several times, different ships, just doesn't work consistently to be worth it. Chops Grille was a disappointment, tables tooo close and the noise level outrageous. Large parties of 8+ yelling across their tables, could barely hear our waiter. Giovannis much more pleasant atmosphere. The excursion to Dolphin Cove in Jamaica was great...unfortunately docking in Falmouth makes many of the excursions 45 minutes away. Ocho Rios much easier to access fun things to do. Glad we went and enjoyed the ship.
3.0	Sail Date: Jan 15, 2017 /	There were many good things about the ship but there were also several concerning issues that we were very unhappy with. We had problems with our bathroom breaking for a couple days. The food and some of the specialty restaurants was not what we expected it to be it was mediocre.  The staff with the flow rider or very unprofessional.
3.0	Sail Date: Jan 15, 2017 /	This was our first cruise on one of the world's largest cruise ships.  Spectacular ship and for it's sheer size, is very well run/organized. All Shows are outstanding - professional entertainers, set decorations, costumes, seating, etc. We were fortunate in having a travel agent that made all our advance reservations for shows and we made our excursions in advance. Wanted anytime dining but heard rumors that you had to wait for extremely long periods. So we early dined.
5.0	Sail Date: Jan 08, 2017 /	Too many wonderful features on this cruise to pick a favorite!  Great ship, fun excursions, service, amenities, entertainment venues, etc., etc.  Definitely recommend this cruise to others!  Improvements: bring back Viking Crown lounge & Connoisseur Lounge; also the Prohibition Party was a good idea but could have stood better execution.

Read ppr for daily events.

No announcements..we missed quite a few activities and they are all over a very large ship"
5.0	Sail Date: Jan 08, 2017 /	"The Oasis is a great ship with a great crew. I had a boardwalk balcony, 8329, which provided an awesome view of the aqua show. Only drawback is that you have to stand to see the show as the balcony glass has a salt film. I enjoyed watching the rock climbing wall and boardwalk area, too. I would definitely book the cabin again. I booked early so I was able to reserve shows as soon as they were released and had no issues getting tickets for the times I desired. I enjoyed all of the shows although I will admit to leaving Cats at intermission. The food was good and service was excellent in the dining room. I like to ""share"" a table in the dining room at breakfast but sharing tables weren't available every day which was a disappointment. The aqua show was cancelled the first night due to weather and there wasn't much else going on around the ship. I miss having a welcome aboard show. There wasn't much going on the last night of the cruise either. I wish there had been more music then. Overall, great cruise and definitely recommend Oasis."
5.0	Sail Date: Jan 08, 2017 /	"We left Port Canaveral on the coldest morning of the year and followed the cold front south.  Fortunately Oasis of the Seas was a good sailor.  Our veranda however (deck 9) was covered with salt!

 

As usual the entertainment was first class. 

 

We took the 3 night specialty dinner package.  Especially enjoyed 150 Central Park.  Never been there before.  I'd have to say the new menus in the MDR were not top notch.  Fewer options.  Windjammer was great.  Always very helpful and they had a better selection of food then the Main dinning room.

 

Our cabin and the whole ship was very clean and well maintained."
3.0	Sail Date: Jan 08, 2017 /	"My favorite part of the cruise was dining at 150 Central Park. The food and the service were outstanding. The Atlas pub has a nice selection of beer, and renting a cabin in sky class had it's nice perks.

They have a problem with adding items onto your bills, so watch out for that. It is a hassle to deal with these so I suggest they get their act together in this department. They take them off when finding they aren't your charges, but it takes up quality time when going to have them taken off at guest services.

We stayed in cabin 1712, and Stephan and his assistant did a fine job of cleaning our room each day. Friendly greetings whenever we saw them in the hallway. Guido in the private lounge was also nice and my son enjoyed visiting with him.

Other than the food in 150 Central Park, all the other food was just okay, as was the service. The service in Coastal Kitchen was good and we enjoyed two meals there. 

St. Thomas was quite dirty compared to my last visits there. We did find a new bar and tried it out this trip called the Royal Anchor. The owner (who had just made his homemade pierogies) and the bartender Matoya were very friendly and fun to be around. We shopped a bit and bought Belgium chocolates and such, then stopped into our regular bar there Coconuts.

Nassau, was fun at Senor Frogs. My son had his first steps into an ocean (at 40 years old) and it was COLD! lol

St. Martin was very nice as were all of the people who I encountered there. Will visit there again in the future.

We went to see the theater performance of Cats. I thought my son and sister would enjoy it, but they didn't care for it. We saw the comedy show one night and that was pretty fun. My sister took her grandchildren to the movie and said it was a great time."
5.0	Sail Date: Jan 08, 2017 /	Loved spending time in the casino and on the pool deck. Main improvement would be in all the extra charges for drinks and specialty restaurants (especially ALCOHOL). The cruise is already expensive. But it was great! Highly recommended.
5.0	Sail Date: Jan 08, 2017 /	Service was absolutely excellent and the staff couldn't have been more spot on. Never felt like I was too crowded and never once found an area that was unkempt. Maintenance was outstanding and the experience was all I could ask for!
3.0	Sail Date: Jan 08, 2017 /	they got you on the ship fast getting off suck food was good did not know that you had to have reservation to see comedy show got to see none that suck had to change cabin did not get much help  when it was there doing it is a pretty ship waited a long time to go on it wish I had pick something else bingo was high to play an not very organized an I have been on just under 20 cruises
5.0	Sail Date: Dec 31, 2016 /	"Many people shy away from big ships as they fear facing masses of people.  In truth the Oasis of the Seas is big enough to allow people to be spread across many activities, restuarants, shows, etc.  We stayed on the 8th floor, which was great as ""Central Park"" was right there with a great bar, cafe, restaurants, etc.  The specialty restaurants were excellent and worth the upcharge.  Yoga on the helipad was awesome!  The Aquashows were amazing.  The ""All Access"" tour of the ship, including the bridge, was well worth it."
4.0	Sail Date: Dec 31, 2016 /	"We were on the Oasis for 8 nights beginning 12/31/2016.  The ship was very nice.  Even thought the ship is huge, it never felt crowded on board.  There was always a place to sit on the deck, sit for breakfast/lunch etc.  The emphasis on cleanliness was impressive.  From the hand sanitizer in the Windjammer to the recommendation to open public restroom doors with a paper towel, everything was immaculate.  Service was also commendable, especially in the restaurants.  We were on a different cruise line a couple of years ago and the service was not even comparable to what we received on the Oasis.  My only complaint was with respect to our excursion on St. Kitts.  We did a nature kayak excursion which was not well organized at all.  The excursion vendors need to be better vetted before they are considered for booking by Royal Caribbean.  We were also less than thrilled with the beaches on the Royal Caribbean private Island of Labadee, Haiti.  The beaches were very rocky (hard to walk on).  I would have rather had another island as a stop on the itinerary.

 

All in all a lovely vacation."
5.0	Sail Date: Dec 31, 2016 /	"The Oasis of the Seas is a wonderful ship and we had a great time!  All the entertainment was outstanding (don't miss CATS,)!  We loved all of the venues for specialty entertainment (Jazz 4, Bolero's, Dazzles, etc.).  Recommend spending time the first day getting to know the ship.  While it is the biggest ship I have been on, it is easy to navigate from venue to venue and once you know the ship, it seems much cozier!  Hard to believe with 6,000+ people how uncrowded it can seem.  If you are sailing at a peak time (when school is out) make sure to make your reservations for the shows, dinners, etc. ahead of time....and don't be late for the shows.  They start on time and 15 minutes prior to the show they allow the people in the ""stand-by"" line to enter. 

 

Plenty of options for food and beverages.  The solarium is a great place to unwind.  Look for our favorite bar waiter, Anthony!  He does a great job.

 

We found all the crew and staff to be very nice, friendly and accommodating.  Cruise Director Drew Devine and his assistant, Margo, are outstanding.  Watch their morning show!

 

Food on the ship is very good, but not great!  They do have the best sandwiches available, however, at Park Café.  Ask for the Beef on Wek!  Amazingly good!

 

We stayed in a balcony cabin (12653) over Central Park.  Not recommended.  View is very limited (as opposed to the Boardwalk neighborhood where you can at least see the ocean behind the ship) and while on your balcony you don't feel as private as you would in an ocean balcony because all you do is look at other people's rooms and they at you!  

 

All in all, we highly recommend the Oasis of the Seas!  Enjoy!"
5.0	Sail Date: Dec 31, 2016 /	"We find ourselves wanting to nit-pick a cruise experience because we expect everything to be perfect.  We make these comments with that in mind.  There are a few areas in which RCCL can make changes to make a great experience a GREAT experience.  Here are a few:

- Restructure MyTime dining to include the other dining rooms not just the one assigned (ie. Deck 3).  Waiting in line for 45 minutes is not acceptable to then find out that you are being sent to another dining room.  Doesn't Mytime Dining mean ""My Time""?

- Do something about the smoke emanating from the casino.  IT STINKS.  Just walking anywhere on Deck 4 (ie. reassigned dining room) is uncomfortable.

- Servers on Deck 4 were not as good as that found on Deck 3 or Deck 5 dining rooms, are they second string? 

- Good service marks go out to Charlene, American Icon Bar Server, Jackie, our room steward, Olga and Bilyania, our bar servers.  They made this experience wonderful.

- Experience the ice show, and any musical playing on the cruise.  We saw CATS again with a wonderful performance."
5.0	Sail Date: Dec 31, 2016 /	"everything 100% , the best food, the shows omg!! the service incredible !! hope they keep doing it the best cruise ever !! I feel free to recommend  to any one,

is a grat place to be"
5.0	Sail Date: Dec 31, 2016 /	Our favorite part of this cruise is the beauty of the ship, the wonderful quality of food, and the exceptional service. What we didn't like about the ship are three primary things: 1.) There is not enough entertainment for everyone on the ship to attend. We didn't reserve anything when we first got on the ship (it was our first time cruising with Royal Caribbean so we did not know this was a necessity) so we were unable to see any shows; 2.) The chairs on the balconies are extremely uncomfortable. I love to sit out on the balcony is silence and read for hours at a time on Sea Days. But, the chair was so uncomfortable that I could only stand it for about 30 minutes at a time. We saw other RC ships that had really nice chairs, and we have been on several Carnival ships with comfortable chairs; 3.) The ship staff did nothing to prohibit people from saving chairs on Sea Days. The entire Solarium area was saved by 8am with people's towels, and many of them wouldn't return for hours at a time. On Carnival, they go around every 30 minutes and gather up towels and belongings to allow other people to have an opportunity to enjoy the area. As a result, there is always plenty of seating and nobody feels the necessity to save seats. RC has a rule that seats cannot be saved for longer than 30 minutes, but it was not enforced.
3.0	Sail Date: Dec 23, 2016 /	My favorite part was the ship was beautiful.  The food was a disappointment in choices and quality after my first cruise.  Service was OK at best.  If this would have been my first cruise, it would have been my only cruise.
1.0	Sail Date: Dec 23, 2016 /	My favorite part of the cruise is the food at the buffet  restaurants. The food at the Silk dining room sucked. The chicken was dry and hard. The spaghetti was uncooked and not enough tomato sauce. I would recommend to you that when a customer requested to be on a share table that you should accommodate her. But I would not recommend this to anyone else. I have been on the ship for eight days and for six days I have been asking to put me on tables with other people. That did not happened. Only twice they place me on a share table with a couple, because I complained every night and that was it. There were 4 empty chairs next to me. They did not even attempt to fill the whole table. So I am very upset about that. If I wanted to eat alone I would have stayed home. Also, because I purchased two excursion with another company, they would not help me directions or anything else about the tours. I missed my tour excursion in Cozumel, Mexico because I did not know where to go and No one would assists me. So The glass bottom boat left me. I wasted my time and my money. I spent a fortune at the Vitality Spa for my teeth whitening except my teeth did not get to be white. The sad thing about that is the lady tried to convince that my teeth were white!!!! To satisfy me, you can send me two free tickets and all will be forgiven.
4.0	Sail Date: Dec 23, 2016 /	"The Oasis of the seas is an extraordinary and unique ship with the hollowed out center allowing for inside balcony rooms overlooking the central park and promenade decks. This really sets the Oasis class apart from other lines especially for days at sea as you feel like you are in a seaside resort town.

 

The entertainment and activities are very good, but they are the same as other cruise lines, better in some areas, but worse in others. The first suggestion is to improve the comedy clubs. Everyone likes a laugh, including children, yet the comedy club is adults only and there was only one comedian for the whole cruise, so you could only really see his show once. We tried seeing him at the larger Oasis theatre, but the show was the same jokes, which was disappointing. Perhaps for the volume of customers you could have two comedians with an early family friendly show and a later adult show and rotate comedians part way through the cruise when stopping in ports. Our cruise stopped at 4 places and at three of these ports there were other Royal Caribbean ships docked that comedians could be swapped out from. This would be a great improvement to the comedy element of RC cruises.

 

The next suggestion is to have a retro night club, not a modern disco, but something from the 'on the town' type films of the 40's & 50's where there are drinks, music and a short show with singing and dancing. You have the Dazzle bar which is a great venue, but is under utilized and you have the dancers from the Oasis theatre. I can't think of a movie at the moment, but you've seen them, a black and white film where people go from club to club and there is a show with showgirls dancing or telling jokes, an orchestra and bar. You could lift songs from the films - you have the venue, the singers, the musicians and the bar!"

3.0	Sail Date: Dec 18, 2016 /	Have been on several RC ships and this dining room food was not as good.  Over cooked....Chops was much better......Also, very disappointed on getting off ship at Port Canaveral.  Took an hour to get off. The line wrapped half around the ship.  They encouraged people to many times to carry there own bags off to be the fastest,  which to many people did.
3.0	Sail Date: Dec 18, 2016 /	Great ship, huge, but very nice.  Service was ok.  Food quality was disappointing.  Almost have to go to specialty restaurant to get decent food.  Which is sad.
5.0	Sail Date: Dec 18, 2016 /	The ship is awesome and the experience onboard is second to none. The only issues were the disembarking process. Very long lines and seemed there was plenty of room for additional lines if staffing had been made available. The photo lab could not deliver our pictures before we disembarked which was unfortunate. We were initially promised the photos at a set time this changed a couple of times before we were told the lab would be unable to complete our order. My wife was very disappointed!! The services and facilities were great however the photo issues were disappointing and prevent us from having additional photos of our cruise.
5.0	Sail Date: Dec 18, 2016 /	One of the most amazing experiences I've ever had  (and I've been a few places worldwide and seen some other amazing things). Our ocean front balcony room provided the perfect intimate setting for me and my hubby. The staff was generous and very helpful. Opportunities for improvement would be centered around the port itinerary. We arrived in the Bahamas at 7am, but most activities did not start til ~10am and we had to be back on the boat by 1:30pm. It was just not enough time. Also, we spent about 30min in line to re-board the boat. The experience in Haiti was much better logistically. I still gave five stars despite the Bahamas itinerary because the Ship, Staff, and Onboard activities superexceeded my expectations.
5.0	Sail Date: Dec 18, 2016 /	Our family had a great time on this cruise. For as big as the ship was, we really didn't have to wait for food or really much of anything. The food was great. We had My time dining, but when I got on the ship I made our reservations for the week. The only problem we encountered was getting back on the ship in Nassua and the aqua show and skating shows were canceled every night.
4.0	Sail Date: Dec 11, 2016 /	"Our 3rd time on these big ships (2 on Oasis and 1 on Allure). We go for the ships, not the stops. Let's face it, most of the Caribbean stops are boring. But these ships are great. Lots of things to do.

 

Our dining room experience was good. Although the lobsters were tiny this trip!

The buffet was about average.

 

We stopped at St Maartin this trip. That was a nice little stop. Nassua and St Thomas were ho hum."
5.0	Sail Date: Dec 11, 2016 /	"Music in Central Park at night was exceptional.  General entertainment was very good.  Cats well done but boring.  Some venues too small for audiences. 

Tremendous problem with dining room at breakfast and lunch.  Long lines. No sauna or steam room without large fees."
3.0	Sail Date: Dec 11, 2016 /	"Dining room food was above average, but specialty restaurants were disappointing.  Customer service staff was very helpful, but food service staff at morning dining room was at times disconnected, i.e., standing around rather than serving coffee or bakery. Professional entertainment was very good, but ""Cats"" was disappointing."
3.0	Sail Date: Dec 11, 2016 /	It took a long time to board the ship when we arrived around noon the line was very long. There was no line for Crown and Anchor members till you were inside past security. Once we got to our cabin the carpets were soaked from shampooing I guess something happened on the last cruise because there was a funny smell also. All around the ship it seemed you had to wait online for everything just to many people. I will look for a smaller more personal ship next time.
5.0	Sail Date: Dec 11, 2016 /	On board programs were great!  Not much on the ports of call.  But since the ship is big, there are many things to do on board.
4.0	Sail Date: Dec 11, 2016 /	"It is an amazing ship to take. Everyone should do it at least once. We had a balcony C2 in Central Park. Very nice to eat breakfast there. But the problem with the ship was too many lines for eating...etc. We saw CATS and Come Fly With Me. They were both really good shows. And the Headliner was an awesome singer.  The specialty restaraurant were nice.  I liked Chops Grille the best. Sorrentos Pizza was really good snack during the day. 

Boleros was good salsa band music and dancing and the entertainment in the Royal Promenade was a lot of fun.  But I miss having activities on the Pool deck. There would not have been enough room for everyone on the Pool deck. We loved the Huge Solarium and the eating area there. I highly recommend this Adults only area.  The ports were fun ... you can't miss with the Southern Caribbean..HOT and beautiful scenery with great beaches at St. Thomas and St. Marteen."

Could use some improvement: the 12-17 years old program supervision. They were with no supervision most of the time.

2.0	Sail Date: Dec 04, 2016 /	"Oasis is a very large ship, the concept of Central Park Boardwalk and Main Street let you feel like you are on a regular street a great feel and fantastic idea. The ship is designed to extrude money from the day you arrive until the last minute that you leave.

Food a big fall down to the old Royal ships where food was excellent on the oasis we had to send several meals back for being cold. Steak was more like  horse meat, tough and tasteless even when the replacement came just as bad. If this is the new royal way will have to go with Holland America"
5.0	Sail Date: Dec 04, 2016 /	"The ship is magnificent, service personnel friendly, helpful and professional.

Food was outstanding with a great variety available every night.  The Park Café, Wipe Out Café were great.  I found the Windjammer to be a bit confusing the way the various individual set-ups were positioned.

My least favorite part was Giovanni's calling us in our cabin after we had dined there and left to tell us we owed them money because our specialty restaurant coupon we showed to our waitress during our visit was not valid. Our  specialty restaurant coupon was valid and they ended up not charging us. We never did get an apology for the  inconvenience and upset they caused us.  It was also very difficult to find the internet room because there were no signs to direct us."
5.0	Sail Date: Nov 27, 2016 /	"We loved this entire cruise!  We booked a year ago on our last cruise and the ship did not disappoint.  

The ship, in and of itself, is amazing.  The shows were awesome, the food magnificent and the staff, as always, could not have been more friendly if they tried!"
2.0	Sail Date: Nov 27, 2016 /	"We have been on many cruises with Carnival and Princess. This was our first cruise with Royal Caribbean and after our experience and discussions with multiple other travelers, we were not alone in our distaste for our trip.

Positives:

1. The ship was unbelievable~ The different areas of the ship are really nice to meander, but once you've seen it all you will be bored. 

2. The Solarium was really nice to have an adult only section. It was quiet and you could always find a lounge chair. 

3. Chops (Fee based) Restaurant was fantastic. Now that we have experienced the difference between a mega ship and regular cruises, I would suggest buying in advance the fee based specials for all the extra restaurants.

4. In comparison to previous cruises, the checking in, getting off and disembarking procedures were so easy and quick considering the quantity of cruisers. The mandatory safety briefing was by far the best we have experienced.

5. Our room view/location was fantastic. We had a balcony room overlooking the boardwalk towards the rear of the ship. Not only could we watch the shows, we had an ocean view too. (best of both worlds)

Negatives:

1. The crowd was that of much older. I would say maybe 5% were of family age with children. Usually our children (14, 9) find many others to ""hang"" with while onboard and I would say we only saw about a dozen children in total the entire time. 

2. The food was TERRIBLE. I would say breakfast and lunch is pretty much cafeteria quality. Even the salad bar was gross. The dinners were a step up and decent but I wouldn't say they were anything near what we have had on other ships. 

3. The room was as expected but the bathroom shower was tiny. My husband is 6 ft and about 190 pounds and he struggled to move in it. 

4. The service by employees was meh.. Our room steward was the best but everyone else really wasn't interested in even being friendly.

5. The shows.. Well, no one told us to book our shows prior to our cruise. (One of many problems I actually had with Cruiseonly itself) We met some people who told us to book those shows as they will not be able to be done unless you have a reservation... Well sure enough... All shows were booked and its a pretty much too bad situation. They only had a total of 4 comedy shows during the 7 days in which you didn't need reservations but the room only holds 75 people. (do the math, only 300 people of the nearly 6,000 onboard can see it) The water shows off the back has really talented people, but the ""show"" portion was very boring and we didn't finish watching. 

6. The constant selling was probably the most nagging and annoying item during the ENTIRE cruise. Just when you think they can't try and sell you more.. they do. The itinerary is basically full of selling more than the cruise itself. 

 

All in all, we would never do this ship again. It was pretty much all everyone was saying onboard and when we were leaving. The gave up the whole experience for this giant ship.."

5.0	Sail Date: Nov 20, 2016 /	"The ship was utterly the most beautiful well designed ship we have ever been on. I would like to repeat on this or it's sister ship. The crew was hard working and mostly friendly. Not much negative to say. The food was Average. (This area needs work.) Carnival Cruise Line has you beat here. They have more choices that are current to todays wants.  Guy's Hamburger and Taco stands by the pools. Woks, fresh made sandwiches made in front of you, Fresh eggs and omelets. Pizza brick oven style. etc... All this included in the fare. My fifteen year old daughter liked the club's provided in her age group. My eighteen year old liked your entertainment as well as us. Our dining room table 106 was the worst table on the ship!!! however our waiter staff made up for that. 

Ports: Fair. "" Enough said""  We had a great trip."
5.0	Sail Date: Nov 20, 2016 /	"Ship is beautiful. Well worth the money and time. Many things to do for all ages.

Service great. Good food, and amenities.

Second time on the ship. Going out of Port Canaveral now makes it very easy."
4.0	Sail Date: Nov 20, 2016 /	the shows were absolutely fabulous!  Too bad so many folks missed them due to not being aware of making reservations. We had the smallest room I have ever had with RCCLOASIS and quite uncomfortable. Thank goodness our cabin attendant was extremely attentive and efficient. The food was good but not up to the usual RCCLOASIS STANDARD Perhaps due to the amount of folks to feed. The Jamaican excursion was a waste of time at Bamboo Beach. The excursion at Cozumel Sky Reef was outstanding-clean and safe. This ship is too large for my liking and I think stretches the normal high standard of RCCL
3.0	Sail Date: Nov 20, 2016 /	"The cruise was nice but this is a very large ship and you will stand in line for every thing you do. Up to 60 min in most cases. Food was good all around the ship, Our room attendant was great. My time dining on this ship was a joke, but when you did get to eat the portions were large and very good.

My pet peeve was the Flo-rider, kids standing in lines for 40 to 60 min and some suite guests show up and their kids go the the front of the line time after time. This is not right or fair to the other guests on the ship. If Royal is going to give special treatment to suite guests then they need to have a suite guest only day or a special time for them. When you have 6300 passengers it's first come first served."
3.0	Sail Date: Nov 20, 2016 /	Our favorite part of the cruise was our excursion in Cozumel and our waiter in the main dining room who was Ernesto. He did a great job serving us and making my 11 year old son feel happy to go eat. We only got to go to the comedy show one night because we did not know anything about booking those shows. I did book everything else well in advance but I did not know about the comedy shows and this was a big disappointment.
5.0	Sail Date: Nov 20, 2016 /	After completing 29 cruises with all cruise lines I must say this one aboard the Oasis of The Seas was one of the top 3 cruises taken. From embarkation to onboard ship, dining, entertainment,to disembarkation was very enjoyable. Crew members were pleasant and very helpful any time you asked for something. The entertainment was excellent but make free reservations for onboard entertainment prior to boarding will be one that you will not have to do once onboard as there are so many things to see and do once you are aboard. Food was excellent in all the non fee and fee resturants as we dined in the American, Windjammer, Coastal, Chops and Giovanna's.
4.0	Sail Date: Nov 20, 2016 /	Loved the elegant ship and the crew. The food was OK. The shows were really good. I enjoyed playing Bingo & Trivia. The pool was always filled with kids but The Solarium was a wonder place just for adults. It was my favorite place to relax & hang out.
1.0	Sail Date: Nov 20, 2016 /	We loved every moment on the ship.  The Western Caribbean isn't our favorite however but always have a wonderful time.  EVERYONE is always so nice, friendly and helpful. Praises to Menrol Patrick Perry, our stateroom attendant and Richard in My time dining at 5:oo Table 130 Deck 3.  Can't remember the other names.
5.0	Sail Date: Nov 13, 2016 /	"Some might say that Royal Caribbean's Oasis of the Sea's is too big of a ship for them. I think it depends on what you want. We had read reviews of how you could never find a deck chair, how you only had glimpses of the ocean and that the crew was mediocre. I cry foul! The ship is beautiful. Be prepared that you won't know where most things are for the first few days, but anytime you are lost or need a direction or have a question answered, a smiling crew member is there to assist you. We cannot say enough about the cleanliness of the ship and the amount of room in our cabin. We had a balcony facing central park that was fantastic. The first day we arrived we were very concerned about the noise coming from the pool ( lots of party music ) once we set sail that was finished and we found our cabin to be calm and noise free. We always found a deck chair to sit in whether it be in the sun or in the shade. One of our favorite places to lounge was the Solarium at the front of the ship. It is over 16 years of age only and a wonderful quiet solitude. The views of the sea from this ship were amazing and there were tons of viewing area and spaces. We loved our stateroom attendant who went above and beyond each day. The crew of the ship was wonderful, the shows amazing. We would not recommend the ""My Time Dining"" it was a nightmare. The first night everyone who had the my time dining showed up whether they had a reservation or not and it was absolute chaos. We head right on out of there and to the formal dining room ""Silk"" where we met a wonderful head waiter, Glenn who was very happy to change us to 8pm seating. It was such a blessing as we had amazing wait staff who is now like family to us & dining at that time of night is not rushed. You can take your time, talk to the wait staff and leave when you are ready as opposed to being rushed out for the next seated dining. We loved Oasis of the Seas and can't wait until we cruise again!"
5.0	Sail Date: Nov 13, 2016 /	"The entertainment best in the industry!!!!!!!!!!!! The ""anytime dinning is the weak link on the ship.   We waited daily, well over an hour for a table for 4.   Suggest you not allow so many people to choose ""anytime dining"" or open it up to all of the dining places."
5.0	Sail Date: Nov 13, 2016 /	The people you meet and talk to and the staff are so friendly. The dining room food was excellent.  The entertainment was excellent. The ship was big with a lot of people but didn't feel overcrowded.

1.0	Sail Date: Nov 13, 2016 /	Favorite part the nice stores and shows. I would recommend the ship. They need to improve on the menu in the windjammer nothing to choose from same thing almost daily. They need more of a variety. Food was boring each day. Also let us choose how much gratuity we should give for the services delivered.
5.0	Sail Date: Nov 13, 2016 /	My first cruise, and it was excellent. We had a suite, and it paid off everyday by not waiting in long, long lines. Our genie was Letty, and she is a dream. Everything was perfect for our honeymoon.
5.0	Sail Date: Nov 13, 2016 /	"This ship is amazing with so much to do. This food venues are a must to try.  The port itself could use some help with arriving and checking in .

..  Long lines and a little chaotic."
4.0	Sail Date: Nov 05, 2016 /	My favorite part of the cruise was the entertainment that exceeded our expectations.  We also found the dining and cabin stewards were excellent.  The food did not meet the choices that we had experienced in smaller ships.  Ship is extremely big if you enjoy lots of people.
5.0	Sail Date: Nov 05, 2016 /	Even though this is a big ship with lots of people, it never seem crowded. Lots to do as far as amenities and activities. Something for everyone and all ages. Food was excellent in the main dining room and there was no need to spend extra money on specialty dining. We did eat at Chops Grille as we received a certificate to eat at one of the dining facilities for free and it was excellent. Book excursions, shows, drink and internet packages online before boarding as there was a significant increase in the price if you wait to order on the ship and no guarantee to get into shows. The Voom internet service with the surf and play option was excellent. No issues streaming video, video chatting or watching TV on your device. This was a great vacation.
3.0	Sail Date: Nov 05, 2016 /	"It's very difficult not to have a good time on a cruise but this cruise did give frustrate me at times. The ship is gorgeous. It has activities on it that you can only experience on ships of this magnitude but at the same time you find yourself with nothing to do at times. During the days at sea we found large gaps on the activity sheet that there was really nothing going on. The same thing happened on days after we got in from the ports. If you weren't waiting in line for a show it seemed like you were going to be at the bar. With 6000 people on board when there was something you wanted to do you better get there at least an hour early because there venues filled up fast. They would have a game show in a smaller bar area and an hour before it started there was nowhere to sit. When it rained in Labadee our first port and everyone was staying on the boat there was NOTHING to do. Don't they have a backup plan? The outside aqua show, ice show, and comedy show where great. Cats however was somewhat of a bore to me and my party. As I looked around there was quite a few people taking cat naps. We only stayed for the 1st act.

Food and staff in the dining room was fantastic. We had anytime dining and I would recommend against that as well due to long lines. Other than that sit down dinners were great. Overall it was a very enjoyable vacation and I will be cruising again just probably on a smaller ship."
3.0	Sail Date: Oct 29, 2016 /	"Ship needs some refurbishing. Not sure if it was because it was the last Ft. Lauderdale run, but service was kind of spotty, more so in public areas (bars, pool, etc.).

Seems to be a downgrade in loyalty program perks.  (Diamond members)."
4.0	Sail Date: Oct 29, 2016 /	The Cruise was excellent once things were taken care of. When we got on the boat we went to guest services to find out how we received the extras that were outline in our package when we booked through BJ's travel. Guest service looked over the account and found no extras were listed. for example $50 on board credit, specility dinner for two, bottle Champagene. chocolate cover strawberries. Guest Services tried contacting BJ's travel with no success. i tried and was disconnected a couple of times. to finally be told that the vouchers were sent to my email, which we have no record of ever receiving. End result is everything was taken care of as we received a call from guest services the next morning saying everything is all set and sorry for the inconvenience. Other than that hiccup which took a couple cocktails to calm down from and receiving the news the next day. the cruise turn out to be the best ever. my review would have be an excellent if we didn't have that hiccup.......
4.0	Sail Date: Oct 29, 2016 /	had no desire to go on a cruise. retired a year ago and not on our bucket list. friend and neighbor talked us into it.  no regrets. crew sincerely friendly and helpful.
5.0	Sail Date: Oct 29, 2016 /	The ship was beautiful and very clean, The staff was friendly and helpful and went out of their way to make sure we had a superior travel experience. We enjoyed the food and entertainment.
4.0	Sail Date: Oct 29, 2016 /	"My wife and I booked this cruise after selling our condo and wanted to splurge a little so we booked a crown loft suite.  The room was spacious and well appointed, there were a few signs of age, but for the most part, it was stellar.  The amenities and service that come with the room are quite nice.  WE enjoyed personalized service from our loft attendant Ann Marie Ottey - She was the best!  Getting preferred seating at all of the venues and the Suite Lounge where there are free drinks from 8 am to 11:30 Pm, was a highlight. (we are not drinkers but if you are, this is a great deal because alcohol is included)

 

The food was great and believe it or not, we preferred the main dining room for dinner over the Suites Only Coastal Kitchen.  The food in the windjammer was very good as well - There are plenty of great free solutions on board if you do not want to spend any more money.  We did eat at one Specialty restaurant - 150 Central Park.  All I can say is WOW!  The food, the presentation, atmosphere and service were absolutely top notch.

 

The ship is HUGE and amazingly fun with lots to do from surfing to mini golf to ice skating, zip lining and even amazing spaces like the Solarium to unwind under the sun with pools and hot tubs.  IF you get bored here, you aren't looking hard enough for things to do.

 

Our Ports were decent.  We didn't even get of in Nassau because we have been there so many times.  Costa Maya was really good, we were able to go see the Mayan Ruins at Chachoben for $74 for my wife and I.  (the Cruise line was charging $200)  We simply walked passed the entrance to the port where there were taxis galore.  They gave us a driver who drove us to the ruins, stayed and waited for us and brought us back - well worth it.  In Cozumel we did the XPLOR all inclusive.  Wow, so much fun to go to an adventure park with Zip Lines and underground rivers and ATV's.  Although the ferry ride was the worst boat ride i have ever taken, we still had fun at the park.  Please note, if you get sea sick, you might want to pack some dramamine or get the sea sick tablets the boat offers before getting on the ferry from Cozumel to Playa Del Carmen.

 

Overall, this cruise was so much fun and well worth the price tag."

5.0	Sail Date: Oct 22, 2016 /	This was an awesome cruise vacation.  Every staff member that I encounter was very helpful, friendly and was attentive to all my needs.  Royal Caribbean staff makes you feel as if you are the only person on the ship and they care about you.  My room attendant made sure we were taken care of all seven days.  The bartenders and dining room attendants were awesome all my dining needs and bar needs were meet above and beyond.  I cant say enough about these crew members on board the Oasis of the Seas.  AWESOME AWESOME.  Already booked for the next cruise with Royal Caribbean.
4.0	Sail Date: Oct 22, 2016 /	The ship was beautiful and bigger than I imagined. The boarding went well and we were in our cabin within an hour of arrival. My only complaint was the slightly rundown appearance of the hallways and stairs.  The carpets in the cabin areas were worn and dirty.

4.0	Sail Date: Oct 22, 2016 /	We had a very nice cruise on the Oasis October 22 to October 29 and we're looking forward to the next one in 2017.  The food was very delicious and varying dishes were available everyday. The entertainment was quite good also except for the show Cats which is very lengthy and becomes boring after an hour.
3.0	Sail Date: Oct 15, 2016 /	"My favorite part of the cruise was when we got off the ship in St Marten, we road 4 wheelers around the island. What I didn't like about Oasis of the seas,

You have to pay for popcorn (really), you have to pay for all the specialty restaurant, like 42.00 per person for one restaurant in particular and it's the same steak you get at dinner at night IN THE DINING ROOM, no rib eyes  steak or new York strip, a daiquiri is $11.00, carnival $6/7, . There are no iron on board except for you have to pay for someone to iron your clothes. I hate the fact that you had to make reservation to see the shows. I hated that oasis of the seas allow cruiser to make reservation in advance before they got on the ship. So when you tried to make reservation when you got on the ship, all shows were sold out. When you spend your hard earn money to enjoy all that the ship has to offer you find high prices and sold out show. I brought 4 other couples along with me. Everyone of them STATED THAT THIS WAS A SENIOR CITIZEN  SLOW CRUISE AND DIDNOT WANT TO COME BACK TO  ROYAL CARRIBBEAN. THE SHIP PLAYED WALMART MUSIC. WE WERE LOOKING FOR CARIBBEAN MUSIC. PLEASE PASS THIS REVIEW TO ROYAL CAARIBBEAN AND TELL THEM OUR GROUP FROM NOW ON IS CARNIVAL BOUND FROM NOW ON."
5.0	Sail Date: Oct 15, 2016 /	Wonderful time on the Oasis of the Seas. Loved our family dinners in the main dining room with Ronnie as our server. He made each night very enjoyable. Only downfall was our dinner at Giovanni's. Service was very rushed. Atmosphere is cozy but very loud. Food was OK, nothing special. Do not feel it was worth the extra money.
5.0	Sail Date: Oct 15, 2016 /	Exceptonal service. Excellent Food. Variety of restaurants. Many activities to choose from. Alot of programs for children. The wait staff provided excellent service in the dining room. The rooms were kept cleaned every day b y the room attendants.
3.0	Sail Date: Oct 15, 2016 /	The boat itself was very impressive and the shows were amazing. The one downside to the size of the boat was that one had to book ahead if you wanted to see the shows. When we are on vacation we don't like having to be so structured.
4.0	Sail Date: Oct 15, 2016 /	Excellent staff and the ship was beautiful, food was very good, the cabin attendant was a complete gentleman and should be given a raise as soon as possible. I will definitely tell my friends about Royal Carribean and I will be coming back very very soon.
3.0	Sail Date: Oct 15, 2016 /	Limited shore excursions were of moderate quality.  While not a fault of RC, traffic congestion made land tours unpleasant, what with delays and vehicle fumes.

4.0	Sail Date: Oct 15, 2016 /	My sister and I just returned from 7 days Eastern Caribbean on the Oasis of the Seas. Let me just start my saying we are from south Florida and should have known better than to book a cruise for October. I honestly would steer clear of October since it is very rainy even in the Caribbean. We had 2 1/2 days of SUN out of 7 but the ship made up for that. The ship is hands down amazing. The best show on the ship is Come Fly With Me!!! Then the ice skating show and then the Oasis of Dreams show which is a spectacular water show. AMAZING! I promise you these shows will make you feel like you are watching Olympic type professionals. They did a fine job. The food was delicious every where you went. Wind Jammer was nice and had a lot of variety. My only complaint is the service in the Park café for lunch is horrible. The servers were not nice and not helpful at all. They ran out of chips and when you asked questions you got attitude. Everyone else on board greeted you with a smile and were pleasant. My one complaint with Royal is that they close the windjammer to early between lunch and dinner. They closed for lunch at 3:30pm and the only place open for a meal was the Hot Dog stand and Park café. These are complimentary places to eat unless you pay to eat somewhere else. I found that to be an inconvenience because everyone crowded in like cattle to Park café for salad, soup, and sandwiches which by the way the roast beef sandwich was superb!!! Additional advice if you are using your debit card you will have a plethora of holds on your card. Say you bought something for $20.00 they hold $60.00! it makes no sense to me, but it is a lesson learned and we will put cash on our seapass account next time. Oh and if you are going to St. Maarteen be prepared to get bombarded on the beach with woman every 1 min asking you to buy stuff. They do not care if your eyes are closed and you are relaxing, they keep asking!!! I understand that may be there source of income but if I said no politely 10x then why ask again. Royal may want to consider stopping to them as the second trip rather than the last, as many items they were selling many ppl purchased in St. Thomas ( hats, shirts, bags, etc). I do try and support every island so we ate and drank while we were there :). St Thomas is a beautiful island and our tour guide Gwenneth was the BEST and she took us around for 3 1/2 hours for $25.00 can not beat that!!! she took us everywhere to every nook and crennie on the island.

5.0	Sail Date: Oct 08, 2016 /	The main dining room service was exceptional. Also there are so much activites to do on the both you will never be bored. The shows are top notch, best i have ever experienced at sea.
5.0	Sail Date: Oct 08, 2016 /	Island stops were great although we had an issue with beach loungers on the island of ladadee Haiti ( couldn't wade out into water due to too many rocks on the bottom and I'm currently working on issue with royal Caribbean) everything Else was great so much to do and see well worth it
5.0	Sail Date: Oct 08, 2016 /	"The ship is absolutely beautiful!  It is also immaculately clean.  We had a balcony cabin midship on the 10th deck.   Unlike other cruise ships we've been on, our cabin had very little storage areas.  There wasn't even an over the bed storage 

cabinet. There were only a couple of drawers to hold our clothes, and the bathroom shower was very small.  In order to dry off without hitting the glass doors,

you needed to step outside the shower.  The balcony was also very small and we 

were disappointed that they provided you only with a chair and no lounge chair or at least an ottoman to put you legs up.  

The food in Central Park 150 and the service was wonderful!   The food in American Icon was also very good and the service was excellent!  The food in the Windjammer left a lot to be desired.  (Myself and my husband have really loved the food on every other cruise ship that we've been on.)  First of all, there wasn't an omelet/egg station, something that we really missed.  There was no pizza bar, and there wasn't a pasta station which we also really enjoy.   The food that they did offer was okay and the servers were good.

One last thing, the Oasis of the Seas had a most wonderful smell throughout the 

whole ship.  It was extremely pleasant up until the very last day.  The air must have been infused with the aroma, however on the last day, the ship had an unpleasant smell.  The smell of an old ship, probably.  Our cabin attendant was wonderful, very

pleasant, and will to be of help.   The shows on the ship were very good and experiencing ""Central Park"" and ""The Boardwalk"" was something to really appreciate.  The casino was very nice and the the people that worked there

were helpful and pleasant.  So all in all, the ship was good, however, I wouldn't recommend it to someone that hasn't cruised before, however if you want to experience Central Park and the Boardwalk, it would be worth trying the Oasis.

I just feel that because of the age of the ship and the last time that it was refurbished, they could have done a better job of bringing the ship ""more up

to date."""
3.0	Sail Date: Oct 08, 2016 /	"I have some suggestions:

1) I would suggest upgrading their mattresses to Tempur-pedic or the like, and their pillows as well.  The bed was not at all comfortable, and I was immediately missing my own bed and my goose-down feathered pillows, which made me, enjoy the cruise less.  With a foam mattress, there would be no seam between the two twin beds pushed together for one king size.  The current mattresses, pushed together, are terribly uncomfortable with the two edges pushed together.  The stateroom should be supremely comfortable.  When a person is well rested from a good night's sleep they're apt to do more, spend more etc. on board, rather than trying to recover from a night of tossing and turning due to an uncomfortable bed and thin, flat pillows.

 

2) When you have purchased the Deluxe Beverage Package, bottled water in your stateroom ought to be included, not extra.  Also, the Deluxe Beverage Package ought to be all inclusive, not up to $12, which negates the idea of a Deluxe Package.  It's irritating to find that you've paid for an all-inclusive beverage package, only to find out that it is not all inclusive, nor is it unlimited.  I was told I could only get one bottle of water at a time and the only size available was a 16 oz. bottle.  I drink at least 64 oz. of water a day and having to purchase a 12-bottle case of 1 liter bottles of Evian, in addition to the Deluxe Beverage package angered and annoyed me.  It's bad form, it's not good customer service and all together a shabby way to get more money out of passengers.  If increasing the cost of the Deluxe Beverage Package translates to bottle water in the stateroom, more than one bottle at a time, a variety of sizes, and all inclusive, beyond the $12 limit for alcoholic beverages, then I'll pay it.  It's more honest.  Offer different levels of beverage packages if you must, but a Deluxe or Ultimate Beverage Package should be just that.  It's shabby of RC to charge me for a package and then tell me I still have to pay for more once on board.

 

3) The 'My Reservations' feature on board via the television should update with new reservations for restaurants, shows, excursions, activities, etc.  It serves little purpose when you are unable to see what you've scheduled all in one place.

 

4) When you make a reservation for an activity / excursion, on board or ashore respectively, you should receive a confirmation message via the television 'emails'.

 

5) In this day and age of rapid technological communications advances, Royal Caribbean should have an app (whether it uses the Internet or RC's own Intranet) where the passenger can see on their mobile device, deck maps and directories.  For instance, if a passenger is in their stateroom, on deck 14, and they want to go to a particular shop on the Royal Promenade, they could look it up on the directory (in the app) and then get walking directions for how to get there (like google maps), from their current location.  Or if there is an on board activity the passenger is signed up for, they would get an alert from the app on their mobile device alerting them it's about to commence, like a 15 minute warning.  The app could even include an immediate customer survey after the activity/show/whatever, asking the passenger to rate their experience and would they recommend to others, etc...

 

6) For all the merchandising and commercial products available, why not sell things that are exclusively Royal Caribbean experience related, for example, the different salts that are presented at 150 Central Park (which by the way - was EXCEPTIONAL!!!).  RC could sell the salts in their gift shop.  When you experience something like that, you want to be able to replicate that experience at home afterwards.  It reminds you of the excellence you experienced on your cruise and instills the idea that you'd like to take that cruise again to enjoy those things again.  I would also suggest they sell those shrimp crisps in the shops too.  They were yummy."
5.0	Sail Date: Oct 08, 2016 /	This was a great cruise to get away for a week.  The weather was favorable, the stops were fine and RCL's Oasis of the Seas was very nice.  It's amazing all of the amenities that can be put on a cruise ship.  I was very pleased with  and how well we were taken care of by ALICIA UPEGUI.
5.0	Sail Date: Oct 08, 2016 /	"This ship is amazing!  With over 6,000 passengers and 2,000 crew you would think it would feel crowded, but it doesn't.  If a show is getting out or an event is taking place obviously it gets a little crowded, but overall, so much space to roam.  We took our adult children on this cruise as a Christmas present and the week together was magical!  Time to do things together and apart.

The boat is clean and the crew is super friendly!  Couldn't be more pleased! We used the luggage valet to the airport.  For only $25 per person, once you put it in the hallway the last night, you don't see it again until you arrive at your home airport!"
1.0	Sail Date: Oct 01, 2016 /	Very disappointed in the staff was not friendly never smile or not attentive food had not flavor. The ship was nice but way to big would not sail with Royal again this ship is for people who has lots of money the dollar you to death.
4.0	Sail Date: Oct 01, 2016 /	"Wish the wheelchair I requested was in my room when I got there and it was very frustrating not to be able to take the chair off to the destinations. Also, I was promised by the person I booked the cruise with that there would be an anniversary ""surprise"" waiting for us when we got to our room and there was not. Also, we were told we would have a certain onboard credit of a certain dollar amount and it was much less. Overall, the crew was great and the ship was beautiful."
5.0	Sail Date: Oct 01, 2016 /	The captain skirted Huricaine Matthew and the weather was great! Ports of call were beautiful. Food was good too. We mostly ate at the Windjammer buffet. Free shows especially the ice show were wonderful. All crew were professional and helpful. The captain gave us daily weather updates on the in room TV. Would recommend the luggage valet service for only $25 per bag. You sit your bags out the night before you depart and you don't see them again until you pick them up at your destination airport.
5.0	Sail Date: Oct 01, 2016 /	"I've cruised on many cruise lines. Some are good, some not so good. Royal Caribbean with their Oasis of the Seas is great, not just good.

 

For those who are fans of good food, RCI is your first choice for broad choices in dining. Every meal was amazing. Some meals were so amazing, I called on the kitchen staff to compliment them.

 

Service across the board was spectacular. The staff on board treated everyone like they were special and we felt it.

 

I'm not a fan of huge ships (and this one really took the cake on that), but the processes they had in place for moving the people were efficient (except in one port - took quite a while to get through security). Areas not related to security didn't have much of an impact due to the huge ship passenger population. In fact, the overall feel was of a smaller ship.

 

One hidden gem on the ship: The Solarium Bistro. We enjoyed breakfast, lunch and some dinner there without any crowds. They have a Mediterranean fare and it works well in this location. 

 

As soon as I returned home, I looked up locations and pricing for future Royal Caribbean cruises. That's a good sign, indeed!"
4.0	Sail Date: Oct 01, 2016 /	everything, food, service  crew, room attendant, diner waiter.  the ship is beautiful. central park is wonderful. the trees and the flowers are all real.
4.0	Sail Date: Oct 01, 2016 /	had a good time, ship is very big and an a lot to do. this will be the last time on a Oasis class ship, going back down to Freedom class. didn't like the need to pick shows 3 months in advance. only a 90 seat comedy club on a ship with 6,000. sometimes had to wait to eat. but happy I went to have the experience of the big ship, very smooth at sea.
4.0	Sail Date: Oct 01, 2016 /	"First time on the Oasis and probably our last.  Had several small issues but enough to make our time in the Customer Service line a real pain.  Had a beautiful room overlooking Central Park but all we could see was the top of trees.  Dinner at Chops was great, well worth the extra expense.

We like the idea of sitting with the same people nightly for dinner.  We had dinner reservations nightly and that was chaos.  Each line, with and without reservations, was pretty long.  Bad thing is people were walking by the table throughout the meal.

The noise on the ship was amazing.  I'm sure there were places to sit and have a relaxing drink but we didn't find them."
5.0	Sail Date: Oct 01, 2016 /	The Oasis of the Seas is a fabulous ship. Our loft suite met all of our expectations. Suite class is the only way to cruise. The perks are well worth the cost. The staff of this ship really made our vacation. Friendly, professional and great at what they do. And how do they remember all the guests names? There was more to do than you could fit into 7 days. My only complaint was the airline reservation process. I booked our cruise far in advance and the flights were changed, we were given the wrong information and then changed again. It took me 12 hours of phone calls to get our departing flights corrected and confirmed. I blame this equally on Hilton Honors and , their representative. I understand that Royal Caribbean books the flights, but they were not who I was working with. My suggestion would be to book your own airfare. Otherwise, book that suite and sail away into paradise.
5.0	Sail Date: Sep 24, 2016 /	"The Ship itself was our very favorite part of the cruise.

There is something for everyone to do or do nothing !

Many good restaurants to dine in and great pools on board.

We had a fantastic cruise and love Royal Caribbean !

5.0	Sail Date: Sep 24, 2016 /	"I consider myself a seasoned cruiser so take my word for it when I say, ""This cruise stood out from the rest"".  I have chosen most cruises either for destination or because they are a good bargain.  I chose this one for the ship - Oasis of the Seas - and it exceeded my expectations.  I am hard pressed to find something I did not like or would change (with the exception of one of the Ports).  The ship is simply amazing with so much to do and see onboard.  My stateroom overlooking the Boardwalk was spacious and very comfortable, the staff was friendly and helpful and I can't even begin to tell you about the food.  My last two cruises were on another cruise line and I had to use Specialty restaurants almost every night in order to get what is in the main dining room on the Oasis.  I did go to a couple of Specialty restaurants just for the experience though.  150 Central Park was superb!  I highly recommend this cruise."
4.0	Sail Date: Sep 24, 2016 /	"After years of hoping to sail on the Oasis one day, that day finally came. Sadly, all that excitement and anticipation turned to disappointment when it came to the food included in the sailing price. I was shocked to see that they actually had selections on the dining room menu that had a premium charge connected with them. Isn't it enough that most ships now have premium pay restaurants which are supposed to provide an exceptional dining experience. When I first started cruising, 30 years ago, the main dining room provided an exceptional dining experience at every meal. Those days are gone and they must have disappeared in the past 3 years (last time I cruised).

   I was concerned that on such a large ship there would be long lines, difficult embarkation and debarkation but there were few times when you had to wait in lines and they were no longer than on smaller ships. Entertainment remains spectacular with ice skating shows, Cats, Come Fly with Me aerial acrobatics and the Aqua Theaters diving and synchronized swimming show. And there remain many clubs and music venues to chose from. I was disappointed with the TV choices in the stateroom and now you have to pay $11 for a pay per view movie. Very minimal amount of movies shown on the big screen outside.For people with children, this seems like a very good ship to choose. There are Dreamworks character appearances, Dreamworks TV programs, special pool areas for kids and special kids programs. 

   There are some really nice adult only areas too. The solarium area is quieter, more plush and inviting but too warm at times. And Central Park is a great place to enjoy the tranquility of the area as long as blaring music from the main pool area isn't drifting in there.

   Overall, it is a great ship. I guess I just can't get past the fact that if you want to have really good meals on board or juicy thick hamburgers and creamy ice cream, expect to be paying the premium charges for places like Ben & Jerry's, Starbucks, Johnny Rockets or one of the numerous specialty restaurants. Personally, I would rather see the cruise lines charging an extra $250 up front and have all those special things included in the price instead of nickle and diming you to death once on board."
3.0	Sail Date: Sep 24, 2016 /	The Suite was the best part of the cruise. There are many cruises that have the same itinerary but few ship with cabins and views like those available on the Oasis of the Seas.
5.0	Sail Date: Sep 24, 2016 /	I loved the ship. However, I was not able to see many of the shows onboard. Royal Caribbean has all guest reserve a seat to any show. All the theaters onboard are too small. They can't accommodate all the guest onboard. Royal Caribbean knows this is an issue but does not add additional shows. This practice angers many Royal Caribbean cruisers
5.0	Sail Date: Sep 24, 2016 /	My family and I had a great experience aboard Oasis of the Seas. The food was top notch! We were delighted to see escargot (which we love) and New York cheesecake on the menu every night. The dining room staff were attentive, polite, and provided personalized service which we found to be outstanding. We enjoyed Cozumel and Jamaica. We found Royal Caribbean's private island (Labadee, Haiti) to be a little artificial and had limited excursions -- we could have done without this stop -- although they made up for it by offering an extensive buffet on the island with salad, jerk shrimp, BBQ ribs and more. The ship is massive and has something for everybody. The comedy show seating was very limited so be sure to book your tickets early. We went on a 7-day trip and we will gladly go on another 7 days to see everything. This is my 11th cruise and no other ship has come even close.
4.0	Sail Date: Sep 24, 2016 /	Great specialty restaurants.  Loved Central Park.
4.0	Sail Date: Sep 24, 2016 /	"Overall we had a great experience. Nice friendly staff, clean and well maintained cruise ship, plenty to do for the us and our two girls.

 

The only two complaints we had were that we paid for a beach and water park excursion at our 3rd and final port, Cozumel Mexico. The beach was fine but the water park was closed and our kids are to small for the ocean water park, no one told us this. This was very misleading and we did not get our monies worth. Since the excursion is part of the overall package offerings we definitely felt cheated. 

 

The food was average not as good as our previous Royal Caribbean cruise."
3.0	Sail Date: Sep 24, 2016 /	The food was awful. The temperature of the food was below room temperature. The variety of food was poor and food taste was horrible. The tea and lemonade was always sour and not even good once you added sugar. The restaurants were not good as well. Shrimps were so soggy in American icon that my husbabd and I started vomiting.
4.0	Sail Date: Sep 24, 2016 /	"The entertainment was superior and the ship was beautiful!  Central park was a breath of fresh air on a ship and nice to have with the nature surrounding you in the middle of the ocean.  The restaurant 150 Central Park was quite an enjoyable experience. 

 

The food was not as good as I've had on other ships such as Carnival. Their selection at the buffet was repetitive. They never had a midnight buffet or extravaganza food for show and Windgammer would be closed much earlier than other ships.. The pizza was terrible and they didn't have real maple syrup, only processed corn syrup."
5.0	Sail Date: Sep 24, 2016 /	My favorite part of the cruise is the central park.  I love the flow rider and the all the shows. I wish I had a suite. Didn't expect to meet so many great people. Staffs members are very nice even though most of them don't speak good English,  but they go above and beyond to make sure it's the best vacation you ever have.
3.0	Sail Date: Sep 24, 2016 /	"Nice ship..food was good. Head waiter was good. Overall worth the money. 

Balcony room with ocean view recommended. Balcony w park or boardwalk view has no privacy.  Shows were good amd quality. Need more live bands."
4.0	Sail Date: Sep 24, 2016 /	portsto visit are not that good labadee beach no good Jamaica beach not clear the best was Cozumel the shows wre booked did not know had to make reservation  could not see any shows
5.0	Sail Date: Sep 24, 2016 /	My favorite part of the cruise was the shows that were offered. There was always something to do on the Oasis of the Seas. Besides being a beautiful ship it was well maintained. Staff in the Windjammer, our stateroom attendant and our waiters for our night dinner in the Silk Room were very courteous. Loved the band by the swimming pools during the day. This cruise was money well spent!
5.0	Sail Date: Sep 24, 2016 /	My favorite part of my cruise was when my daughter saw her room and saw that it had her birthday decorations she was over the moon excited to see it as well as the ocean.
5.0	Sail Date: Sep 17, 2016 /	"My husband and I were married on our cruise. It was held in Central Park and, because the Wedding Coordinators cannot close off the park, we had over 100 fellow passengers, our Room Attendant, the Bartender from our favorite Pool Bar, and our family in attendance. It was absolutely magical. To be married at Sea by Captain Rob was a once in a lifetime experience and we have a beautiful and original story to share with everyone.  

 

The ship was amazing!! It literally is like a small city and you had everything at your fingertips. From free food to karaoke music and nightclubs, pools and hot tubs, shops and jewelry stores, etc., you have a plethora of things to see and do on the ship between ports. If you forget to book an excursion, there are excursions you can book on the ship."
5.0	Sail Date: Sep 17, 2016 /	Loved sitting on the balcony watching the ocean go by and coming in and out of ports.  The food was good.  The shows were entertaining.  Comedy show was really funny.  Come Fly With Me was really good.  The second half of Cats was better than the first.  Cabin comfort was really good. Bed was really comfortable.  Ship was beautiful and amazing.
4.0	Sail Date: Sep 17, 2016 /	"The favorite part of our cruise was the entertainment and all activities planned during the day or night for us.

Cannot think of anything that could be approved upon.

Yes, will recommend to friends, family and others."
4.0	Sail Date: Sep 17, 2016 /	I am looking forward to going on this ship again in March.  All of the crew was very friendly & would visit apart their country.  The ship was a little hard to navigate, I kept getting lost.  We tried several different food options & generally pleased with them.  I do wish they would offer more healthy snack options like carrot sticks.  The only dining options open late were sandwiches or pizza.  Embarkation went pretty smoothly quickly.  The shows were all fantastic.  They only had 2 of the ice shows & we got there too late the first show (with reservations) to get a seat so had to stand.  The ice rink is only available for open skating just 1 day so keep an eye out for it.  We went to the dining room several times (MTD) & were seated pretty quickly.  I would recommend that you 0get a table for 2 as the large table we sat at 1 night took 2 & 1/2 hours.  The Splish Splash show was only scheduled 1 time & that was cancelled for technical difficulties.  We did enjoy the movies in the Aqua Theater.  We had to opportunity to go on a galley tour for $20 each & it was fantastic.  We were served snacks & champagne after the tour.  We also went on a garden tour in Central Park.  I would definitely recommend both tours.  They should be on a Do Not Miss list.  Leaving the ship in port went quickly as long as you remember to have your sea pass card & picture ID.  Running out of ice seemed to be an issue as well as the soda machines were picky & you had to try several times to fill your soda mug.  They didn't seem to have iced tea available until noon.  My friend did not like the piano player but there was so much to do & listen to that we just tried something else.  These issues were so small that they would not keep me from cruising on the ship again.
5.0	Sail Date: Sep 17, 2016 /	"The service we received was awesome. 

If there are more than two people in a suite you need the Jr Suite!  our suite attendant was very nice did everything to make our vacation a vacation.

0ur  dining was  excellent our waiters Victorious and Gabriel were at our table to make sure we were okay that our needs were met"
5.0	Sail Date: Sep 17, 2016 /	We had a balcony overlook Central Park-it was wonderful to look out and see trees and other plants, hear birds singing.  The Silk diningroom was delightful-we had the best waiters: Victor and Yatin.  The onboard entertainment was amazing!!  Even though I did not have any children with me, the pool and splash area for the younger travelers was GREAT!
2.0	Sail Date: Sep 17, 2016 /	Cruise was great we love the ship and crew this is our second time on the Oasis we have a vacation planned on the Harmoney next year Royal Carribean is the only way to go.
4.0	Sail Date: Sep 17, 2016 /	"The ship itself was outstanding. Entertainment was at the Royal Caribbean level, which is to say top class! Lots to do, the Central Park neighborhood was beautiful, great décor and very well kept up. We made 3 stops, all of which were easy to get access on/off the ship. Excursions were easy to find. Plenty of food options all over the ship - if you go hungry, you aren't trying very hard. Dinner reservations were always on time, never waited, and food was good. If you forgot to make a reservation in the main dining room and did not want to wait for a table, there are still plenty of other immediate dining options available as well.

 

The only drawback was the crowds. If you wanted to lay by the pool, good luck getting a seat after 9 am. Signs are posted saying unattended seats will have items/towels removed after 30 mins of non-use in order to free up spots for those who actually want to be by the pool...this never happened. Seats would have towels laying on them for hours with no sign of use, people will claim lounges in the morning and never be around to use them."
5.0	Sail Date: Sep 17, 2016 /	This Ship ( oasis of the seas) is a wonderful entertaining non stop fun , from the time you walk on board to the time you leave Drew and his team has something always going for the guest. The layout of the ship, easy access to room , stores , cafes and anywhere else someone need or wants to be is smooth and easy . The food aboard in the dining hall or in windjammer I could not say a bad word on it was all great. There is nothing that wasn't just right , the staff always very helpful you always feel welcome .
4.0	Sail Date: Sep 17, 2016 /	"Most of the staff was ""RCL"" friendly... My cabin attendant was more concerned that we get out of the cabin on arrival day and let us know that verbally."
4.0	Sail Date: Sep 10, 2016 /	There was always plenty of different types of food to eat, lots of things to do shows, shopping, swimming & whirlpools, spa, flowrider & zip line & relaxing with no worries of phone calls or texting & meeting talking to new people
5.0	Sail Date: Sep 10, 2016 /	The price of the Sky Loft Suite was a little much for just getting back into the cruise scene, however the overall experience with Star class, Royal Genie, gratuities included, and the Expedited embarkation and especially disembarkation were all ABSOLUTELY worth it!!! The room was an experience like no other for us. We were fortunate to book another for a reasonable price which is the A1 Aqua theater suite because we were blown away with the service and the ship overall.
4.0	Sail Date: Sep 10, 2016 /	"The size of the ship was astonishing with lots of attractions, lots of restaurants and lots of bars.  This ship has everything...no need to get off. The Central Park & Boardwalk sections were terrific!  Food was great in the dining room service all over the ship was very good.

 

We ate at Chops, Giovanni's Table and 150 Park. The atmosphere and service at these specialty restaurants was excellent but the food was not any better than in the dining room. 150 Park had a small plates menu which was unique.  We enjoyed the dinners in these specialty restaurants but I doubt we will spend the extra money next time.

 

Our booking was to include free internet for the cruise but someone forgot to tell the ship crew.  The ZOOM group onboard responded quickly and resolved the issue while guest services contacted their Florida offices for confirmation.  The ZOOM internet is fast and we saw no interruptions in service.

 

We had pre-selected wine before the cruise and we felt there were very limited choices and most were over-priced.  The wine selections available onboard were worse.

 

The crew should get 5 gold stars for service and responsiveness.  This is a customer service business and they all do it right, down to every level of the crew we interacted with.  They were courteous, friendly and most of all, they took ownership to resolve our questions."
5.0	Sail Date: Sep 10, 2016 /	"The ship was breath taking. The water show was the best. Need more shows and a bigger comedy room with much ""bigger"" comedians, although both comedians were great. I still enjoyed myself overall."
5.0	Sail Date: Sep 10, 2016 /	"The shows and dinner were the best part. The shows were quite good, really enjoyed the water and ice shows. Cats was a little slow, we left at intermission.

Dinner was great, really good food and excellent service in My Time Dining with our waiters, Valento and Dheeraj at Table #117.

Johnny Rockets was disappointing, we had to ask 2 or 3 times for a waiter. The milkshakes were delicious once we got them.

We bought the soft drink package, there should have been more dispensers. One of the dispensers on the Promenade didn't work correctly most of the time.

The tours we took on the ship of Central Park and the Captain's answer and response time were excellent.  My husband was a little disappointed with the fitness center.  He felt the FC needs someone there to clean, lubricate, & help out with those individuals who might have a couple basic questions regarding the equipment, & to make sure all work stations are in good working order."
5.0	Sail Date: Sep 10, 2016 /	"I was very impressed with all the different sections on the ship for various entertainment .  From front to back. Top to bottom!!  Professional Divers in the rear with the 17 feet dive pool literally at the back of the ship!  Wonderful Ice Skating Show.  Missed seeing Cats. ( I've seen that on Broadway). 

The food was really great !  Got to know a few of the bartenders.  These workers are on this ship 8 months at a time!  Most of them have been working for the company several years. One female assistant server was homesick and not going to continue😕.  

Overall I know the ship is a few years old.  I was supprise D at the condition of the towels, napkins, chair cushions in the entrance to the restaurant.  Several other dirty areas caught my eye which I was supprised!!  My cruise mate told me I should work for the company and be a secret cruiser!!

I do, would recommend this ship though.  It's being replaced soon with The Harmony of the Seas I believe..."
2.0	Sail Date: Sep 10, 2016 /	It was my second round on the mega vessel..On the first voyage I was so overwhelmed we went from a group of five to a big group of twenty six family members because of our bragging.... WELL lets just say on this one there were times  I was downright embarrassed. First my cabin was suppose to be a double, they pulled the beds six inches apart and then they said it is now a double! THEY TOLD US THAT'S HOW THE DOUBLE ROOMS ARE... WHICH WAS A LIE BECAUSE LATER I SAW ROOM 6603 AND THE BEDS WERE APART WITH TWO NIGHTSTANDS IN BETWEEN!!!!! we could barely get our luggage in the room. The room was too small for two people,  we spent a lot time in that LONG line at Guest Services which was a waste of time and very frustrating!.   Second my room didn't have power the first night and part of the next day. The people at guest services just DID NOT CARE AND IT WAS JUST NOT IMPORTANT TO THEM that we could not get a shower to get dressed to go be with our family!  Third the MyTime dinner service was horrible and the menu was even worse! I know this compliant is cross the board because we skip Mytime dinning and dined in the windjammer and was asked why and we ask them why the survey and they told us the dining rooms downstairs were a bit empty. We had to wait too long between courses and it seem to be very chaotic. NOT A GOOD EXPERIENCE AT ALL! Oh and we will do a formal compliant, Its not over because our room situation was UNEXCEPTIONABLE! Last it was just too many people this time.. I'm not sure if I will be returning..However our room attendant (Mohan)  and the windjammer people were great!   Park Cafe is still my favorite!
2.0	Sail Date: Sep 10, 2016 /	The ship was too large for my taste...way too many people meant standing in line for everything.  There were too many restaurants that you had to pay whereas the cruise food should be included for the price you pay for the cruise.  The shops were high end and not that great of deals in any of them.  The food in the main dining rooms wasn't that great either.  We felt like we were on a rolling slot machine.  Felt somewhat unsafe at Labadee...the locals were very pushy and intimidating trying to sell there handmade items.  Also, both of our credit cards were compromised and had fraudulent charges.
3.0	Sail Date: Sep 10, 2016 /	"The Oasis is a very elegant and luxurious ship, very nice! but not much included..

Some observations:

1. Not much variety on the buffet.

2. very scarse seafood, food needed more temperature, more variety.

3. Specialty restaurants very expensive price p/p and not much included.

3. lack of service from waiters; sometimes we had to clean the tables ourselves!

in order to use..

4. THe beverage packaged changed prices a few days before the cruise. much higher price, leaving no options.

5. Excursion guest services not very friendly and cooperative when asking for

recommendations..

6. too many lines to get into the dining areas..

7. not much variety on shows... 2 good ones...others below average..

8. After checking out and got home, found out our final bill was charged incorrectly after discussing at the front desk 2 days before leaving the ship!"
5.0	Sail Date: Sep 10, 2016 /	We had a great time!  We went to Red Stripe Beach in Jamaica and it was a nice safe, secure, small beach with only Royal Caribbean guests.  No one was trying to sell you things that you did not want.  We enjoyed the Red Stripe Beach.
4.0	Sail Date: Sep 10, 2016 /	Overall we enjoyed the cruise. It is a huge ship. Getting around was not difficult but we did a lot of walking. We had to wait for elevators . The major fault we found that there were no lounge areas with comfortable seating with a view of the ocean that we could just sit and relax. The few places we did find were noisy and seating left a lot to be desired..
5.0	Sail Date: Sep 03, 2016 /	rooms service was excellent and fast! Dinner service was professional and the food was delicious! All around an amazing service! We had access to more shows, activities, and food than we could handle! Every day there was a clear cut plan for what we can expect, even better is the fact that every single event planned started exactly when it was scheduled. This speaks to the professionalism of the crew and cruis staff!
5.0	Sail Date: Sep 03, 2016 /	Big ship we had fun. It is a lot to do. The staff are the best. The food was great. The park was very nice. There where lots of pools. I zipped line for the first time,loved it.

I do recommend more training for some bartenders on customer service and attitudes towards paying customers...over all it was a great time..
3.0	Sail Date: Sep 03, 2016 /	i would recommend slightly smaller ship unless you are traveling with kids with very short attention spans.  service and things you come to expect on royal caribbean cruise ship were lacking - for example: only got 3 towel animals (i know, kinda picky, but we enjoy the surprise of what it will be tonight); my time dining on ship this large is challenging as well - stick with early/late option; be advised- if you are crown & anchor members, this ship did not have a repeaters party, very disappointing as well.  overall, we did have a great trip; most of the staff were very nice and made some new friends!
3.0	Sail Date: Sep 03, 2016 /	The ship is beautifully laid out lots of spaces to relax in . The food wasnt that great anywhere on this ship including the specialty restaurants ,we ate at giovannis and the Solarium Bistro just wasnt what we expected paying an extra charge for. The service was good and the shows were good too. Now we can strike this off the bucket list, ill stick to the mid size ships from now on .
5.0	Sail Date: Sep 03, 2016 /	We have been on about 30 cruises and did not think we could be impressed, but this ship impressed at every turn. Our 8 year old loved camp and we all loved the activities. Can't wait to go again!

The ship is beautiful and very clean 

The dinning is also very good and the waiters are the best.

The oasis is one of the best ships out their'"
4.0	Sail Date: Sep 03, 2016 /	"The ship is amazing. Everyone working on it couldn't have been nicer. The extra restaurants were delicious.  Giovannis Table and 150 Park Ave were our favorites. If you get the opportunity, do the ""All Access"" tour. My only problems with the ship was that while sitting out by the pools, there weren't very many people coming around to get your bar order. You pretty much have to go get your drinks yourself."
4.0	Sail Date: Sep 03, 2016 /	"Loved all the things you have to do on the ship.  Shows were very good. Many venues to dance etc. Loved Central Park and all of the specialty restaurants.

 

Unfortunately the pools are very little for so many people and there are way too many Jacuzzis.  Not a single pool was for adults only etc."
4.0	Sail Date: Sep 03, 2016 /	The cruise ship was nice and spacious. We stayed in a boardwalk view stateroom. I felt like the carpentry inner walkway to our cabin is a bit outdated and could you a fresh face lift. The carpet in our room was very thin and barely has any cushion. The service received on the cruise was spectacular. The staff did not try to upsell you with things and were not pushy at all. I highly recommend the any of the aqua theater shows. The specialty dining restaurants were superb as well. Highly recommend making reservations in advance. I was not able to attend a few of them because only late in the evening time were available. Bummer.
3.0	Sail Date: Sep 03, 2016 /	My favorite part of the Cruise was the shows an Chops Gril restaurant the food was excellent and our waitress was sweet and courteous.Our waiter and bus boy in the dinning room Riley and Nikola were superb and sweet.The ship overall was very clean.They need to make the Casino non smoking I tried to avoid going anywhere near the casino.The rooms on the Ship are very small we always get two rooms but this time we got one room with 4 adults big mistake.We also got a room on the Boardwalk very noise and no privacy the rim across can see right in your room.The food in the buffet was good but we only went to it 2 day.The next time I will be going to the specialty restaurants more.We got the drink package on the Ship and d the drinks were very good especially the Champagne bar and Boleros.Over all the Cruise was fun .It was nice to have lobster on the Cruise again the cruises don't give lobster without charging you.
5.0	Sail Date: Sep 03, 2016 /	"Great Customer Service! Royal Caribbean is the best way to go.

 

This ship is huge!!! Lots to do.

 

My only complaint which I think would be company wide is to have a way to restrict arcades for children swiping their sea pass card. I got stuck with a huge bill because of this but other than that it was amazing!"
5.0	Sail Date: Sep 03, 2016 /	"The ship, the organization and the waiters were excellent. Labadee a nightmare of a beach. More time in San Juan. Beach towels were in bad condition. The return issue was not convenient. The pools very small too many jacuzzi.

The food was excellent. The entertainment wonderful."
3.0	Sail Date: Sep 03, 2016 /	"The boarding experience for this cruise was the best we have ever experienced.  It was fast, friendly and we were on the ship in record time.  Oasis is beautiful and so big.  We liked the different areas such as Central Park, or Boardwalk, however, we felt all cruise that we were in a mall and not on the sea.  The size of the ship is also a detriment to the cruise experience.  You have to really work to see the ocean or go back to your room if you have an outside balcony.  I really missed the gentile rocking motion of other ships when going to sleep.  

We were very disappointed in the service.  It seemed that they are working with a smaller staff than they should have which results in long wait times between courses at dinner and virtually no drink refills during the meal.  Also the food quality and taste was not up to previous cruises.  Our stateroom telephone was not working and the attendant was told the first day, it took until next to the last day before they replaced a hand cord and got it working.  As Platinum members, we are supposed to get bathrobes and lapel pins which we never got during the cruise.  

As far as entertainment, you'd better have reservations and able to arrive 45 minutes before starting time to have a chance at decent seats.  All and all, it was enjoyable, but we will not be booking a mega ship anymore.  We can go to the mall without paying for a cruise."
5.0	Sail Date: Sep 03, 2016 /	This was our second time on the Oasis.  We are loyal to Royal and have cruised on the biggest and smallest in the fleet and love all of them.  The Oasis is massive and has so much to do and see.  We particularly liked this itinerary of St. Martin, San Juan, and Labadee, Haiti.  No shore excursions were planned, as we like to get off the ship and wing it.  We had a balcony on the beginning of the 'hump', so we had a bit more room.  All of our dining experiences were wonderful and we ate at Sabor and the Bistro as far as specialty dining.  We have already booked the Harmony for next year's anniversary.
4.0	Sail Date: Sep 03, 2016 /	"Wow! What a ship!  Has everything you need & makes for a very relaxing vacation.

3 more square feet in the showers & it would be perfert.  

 

Restaurants are great. Central Park & Broadway communities are pleasant & relaxing. Lots of activities (basketball, volleyball, dodgeball, flow riding, zip line & rock climbing). 

 

I would take the ""high end"" shopping and devote it to more shower space. I can shop anywhere, including online, I'm not interested in doing it aboard a ship. That's what Sawgrass Mills Mall in Sunrise, FL and  Fort Lauderdale Galleria Malls are for which I indulged in before I set sell."
4.0	Sail Date: Sep 03, 2016 /	This is a huge ship with many activities and sights and entertainment.  We had a central park balcony cabin and enjoyed the view and the quiet especially in the mornings with the birds singing.  The shows were fantastic.  Only one we were not crazy about was the Headliner and it was not bad. Our favorite place was the Promenade with all the places to sit and eat and people-watch.  Several Dreamworks characters appeared there, too.  Our least favorite thing was the Windjammer buffet which was almost always crowded.  For breakfast, check out the Solarium Bistro instead.
5.0	Sail Date: Sep 03, 2016 /	The Oasis exceeded our expectations. The different neighborhoods were a great way to mix things up! The food was delicious at every place we ate and the cruise staff was courteous.
4.0	Sail Date: Aug 27, 2016 /	"The Southside Dance band was great. 

Main dining room food and service was not so great most nights.  Mashed potatoes were better in Windjammer.  Late dinner conflicted with a lot of one time events on board which could have been scheduled better.

The Royal upsell is getting to be too much.  Everywhere on board there is a upsell to get what used to be free. It never stops either.  From walking on board to getting off the ship, there is upsell, pushing, drink packages, photos, videos, dinner upgrades, lunch upgrades, spa specials. Oh you want an exercise cla$$ or go to learn about improving your health and it ends in a sales pitch."
5.0	Sail Date: Aug 27, 2016 /	The Oasis of the seas is  the perfect family cruise ship destination.  The ship is perfect for all ages.  The food was wonderful.  Chops Grille is awesome.  the kids had a great time on board.  We loved Labadee.  Definitely experience the zip-line.  While it is expensive it is a lot of fun. The entertainment was very good.  Are only complaint is the Cats is not a very good musical.  Nothing against the performers as they did a wonderful job.  The show itself is not very good.
1.0	Sail Date: Aug 27, 2016 /	its a beautiful ship. shows arent great and  everyone reserves all the times etc and u cant get in .especially comedy. it should be first come first serve. free food was terrible. but the food you had to pay for was great but pricey. if u dont have the ultimate drink package with the top shelf liquior .  forget it . they were not good. . ports to jamica hati cozelmel were terrible and excursions were not good . alot of people came bak and complained and wanted their money back. i spent my time at  guest services.

4.0	Sail Date: Aug 27, 2016 /	"Oasis is a beautiful ship. Being one of the largest in the world it never feels crowded. The most people I saw together was only at the muster drill. The crew members have a can do attitude regarding anything. 

We stayed in a Jr Suite which is very nice and provides a great balcony large enough for 2 lounge chairs and a bistro table and 2 chairs. 

The restaurants both complimentary and specialty are all nice. 

150 Central Park is by far the nicest cruise ship restaurant. The tasting menu changes mid week giving you an opportunity to dine there twice. 

Additionallt Jr Suite guests may book 2 dinners in the Coastal Lounge Resurant on the 17th deck. This area is only available to those booking grand suites and higher. A great way to try the amenity without booking a larger suite. But makes it tempting to book a class higher. Superb service and upper scale wine list. 

Royal Caribbean does a great job

only comment about the ship is its beginning to look a little worn in the common areas , carpet etc. we cruised on it 3 years ago and I notice it's in need of a little refresher"
5.0	Sail Date: Aug 27, 2016 /	"I would always recommend a Royal Caribbean Cruise to anyone.  I enjoyed the service especially from Dudley Jean, from the Diamond Concierge Lounge. He was always very pleasant and accommodating.

 

I also want to acknowledge Fransic from Romania from the Deck 4 Dining Room. His assistant as well. Both of them remembered our drinks every night and were very welcoming as well.  Great service!"
5.0	Sail Date: Aug 27, 2016 /	The cruise was excellent. The only small glitch was the food during middle of the cruise. Rest, the trip was an excellent vacation. Great job Royal Caribbean, and kudos to  for getting us fabulous deal, and working personally with us.
5.0	Sail Date: Aug 27, 2016 /	"The entertainment was all first-class - the best we have ever experienced

on over a dozen cruises.

 

Food selection and quality was also very good. 150 Park Ave and Chops were

both outstanding but Giovanni's was only average.

 

I also enjoyed the All Access Tour.

 

It was a well worthwhile week."
4.0	Sail Date: Aug 27, 2016 /	The staff couldnt do enough for you.What a wonderful trip. From housekeeping to the bartenders to the waiters. You will be pampered. The only negative was the pools, although there are 4  they were always crowded.
3.0	Sail Date: Aug 27, 2016 /	I liked the size of the rooms and to see the crew constantly cleaning was good. The bartenders were awesome. Despite some issues onboard, it was a good cruise.
4.0	Sail Date: Aug 13, 2016 /	"That's my second voyage with Oasis, staff were nice and happy- entertainment was ok, "" The Quest was good, comedy show was boring. Our dining experience was ok"
4.0	Sail Date: Aug 13, 2016 /	"Our favorite part of the cruise were the ports! We always enjoy visiting new places and seeing the different cultures and meeting new people.

The food on the Oasis was a bit disappointing to us. It just wasn't as good as some of the other ships we have been on. However the service of the staff on the ship was fabulous as always!

Our room had a balcony and that was grand! We enjoy looking across the ocean and looking at the cities as we arrive in the ports.

Oasis has some wonderful shows and the performers were outstanding as they showed their talents during the shows. Our favorites were the Aqua theater and the ice skating show.Those people were just out of this world as they performed their water dives and ice skating talents! Just incredible to watch.

Oasis of the Seas is a beautiful ship with all kinds of activities and things to see and do!"
4.0	Sail Date: Aug 13, 2016 /	"This was an amazing cruise. Here are the notes I took while on the cruise. 

Cruise noted 

St Marten
Water taxi not needed
Cab can take you to sunset beach $10 per person 
Shopping cheaper downtown, but still a little more expensive than other destinations. 
Don't settle on the first store, check them all out and compare prices. 
Watch out for people trying to get cab money, only pay driver. 
Get to sunset beach early, jumbo jet arrives around 11am. 
 
Boat
Cannot bring iron
No free iron to use. Need to use their laundry service. We purchase the downy wrinkle free spray. Use that with a blow dryer. Took most of wrinkles out. 
Drinks are not free. Sodas are 3.25. Liquor depending on what you drink ran about $25 for 2 for us. Water down drinks. 
If you get cold easy, bring a jacket 

Casino. 30 min before the casino opens they have free lessons on the table. Helped us a lot. 

Reservations. Before you leave home go online and book dinner and show reservations. That way you can plan the rest of your day after that. If you don't you have to wait to see a show. 

Haiti
There are cabanas you can rent. There are also covered seating you can rent, but you have to get them early. $35. Don't think it pays to pay for an excursions on this island.  
Beach club"
5.0	Sail Date: Aug 13, 2016 /	"My favorite part of the cruise was the overall appearance, elegance and friendliness of the crew. The food was very good too!  Our cabin steward, Aleus Paul, and the restaurant wait staff at the American Icon dining room were all superb!!!!!  The ship is gorgeous, huge and state of the art!!!!

 

The only negative was the casino.  My husband and I visited there every single night and NEVER won.  We also observed the slot players around us and no one won a jackpot.  That's not something we're accustomed to seeing on a cruise."
4.0	Sail Date: Aug 13, 2016 /	Everything on this ship was wonderful. The activities, the shows, the food. The kids loved every moment.  The only problem I had was that my husband is dairy free, and there are not many dairy free options in the form of dessert and other treats.  I really would like to see the gluten free and dairy free options made available.  He had a horrible experience at Starbucks where he asked for a dairy free beverage and was given one with dairy.  I asked the attendant to correct it, and she informed me I would be charged for the change.  Starbucks does not charge you to correct a mistake.  That was my only problem.  All of the other details were amazing.
3.0	Sail Date: Aug 13, 2016 /	"Being first time cruisers, my husband and I did not know what to expect. Everyone kept telling us ""you'll love it!"" When we walked onto the ship, it looked like a huge mall with 17 stories. It was unbelievable!

Everything you need is right there on the ship. If you love to shop, it's there.  If you love nonstop activities, it's there. This ship seems to meet everyone's needs -- except ours. It wasn't very relaxing nor private; there were just too many people (over 6000 people not including the staff & crew). Also, the stops in the ports felt rushed.

We sailed for three days before getting to the first port, St. Maarten, then onto Puerto Rico and Labadee, Haiti. We spent less that 24 hours in all three ports. So basically, it was a vacation on a moving hotel.

We're used to traveling to all-inclusive resorts on the same day and enjoying the sites/excursions without feeling rushed. Needless to say, this was a different experience.

Maybe a smaller ship may make for a different experience."
4.0	Sail Date: Aug 13, 2016 /	"RCCL lived up to its 5 star standards in its ship (gorgeous!), its first class customer service (specially our cabin stewart Geraldine, our waiter George and assistant) 

the entertainment was also 5 star - all shows were wonderful!   We've seen ""Cats"" on Broadway and I must say this was an excellent reproduction. 

We have taken this itinerary before (yrs ago) and must say we were quite impressed with all the improvements on Labadee. 

Well then, why only 4 stars?   We purchased the ""sensation-SM25 "" tour b'cos description was sightseeing and beach - BIG mistake -  The sites where poor, unkept neighborhoods - the beach was the Atlantic Ocean - rough and full of huge rocks had to wear shoes!  ( our plans were to enjoy the Caribbean not the Atlantic )the beach chairs were in a limited area (3 rows of 6 chains next to the BBQ ) unless you were 'ok' with sitting on the nude part of the beach, and oh yes! BBQ is included but you must pay for water ( sugary punch was free 2 cups per person)   It was beyond disappointing it was upsetting to spend my only day in St Maarten  in that place.

 Had it been my only trip to the island I would have thought that this was normal but I have taken some wonderful tours of St. Maarten  to some beautiful bay beaches on the Caribbean side and lovely sights  with a different cruise line and I believe that a cruise line like RCCL should offer high standard tours.

 The other two stops we did on our own and enjoyed them very very much .

 The spa was wonderful and the attention was worthy of a top-notch spa.

 Thank you for the gift we found in our cabin and for the free spa treatment."
4.0	Sail Date: Aug 13, 2016 /	The ship was beautiful. The food quality has really gone down. Only food available after 9:00PM  free is Pizza, anything else you had to pay for. At the start of the shows, they had popcorn for the children and was charging $2.95 for a small box. They should be a shame of them selves How cheap can they get.
4.0	Sail Date: Aug 13, 2016 /	the amount of activities scheduled. The service and the friendliness of the staff was great. I enjoyed the destinations and adjustment should be considered for the amount of time spent in Puerto Rico
5.0	Sail Date: Aug 13, 2016 /	"We've sailed with four other cruise lines - all for different reasons - and found that this was the best one for adults. Yes, there were Dreamworks characters on-board, but the ship was really geared toward people who were looking for a quiet, relaxing trip. There was no overbearing music on deck, or ""mandatory"" dance parties (when the staff would highly encourage people to join in). We could always find even more peace and quiet in places like Central Park (love the crickets sound-effects after sundown) or the back of the ship once the waveriders were done for the day.

 

The food was amazing and the shows were nop-notch (especially the diving show). The staff was very attentive - from our cabin attendant to the cafeteria workers.

 

There was always something to do, but there was much less pressure to ""be involved"" than the other cruise lines gave, and the TV was an excellent resource for booking activities, getting info on ports, and checking our daily schedule."
5.0	Sail Date: Aug 13, 2016 /	This was my wife and I second time cruising Oasis of the Seas and our adult daughter first cruise ever. Too see her face when she boarded the ship was priceless. We could not believe how huge the ship was. She certainly took advantage of all of the fun activities such as the boogie board Flo Rider, rock climbing, the free shows and the delicious meals. The different places that we ported from where all beautiful.  I do wish that we could have ported longer in San Juan Puerico.
4.0	Sail Date: Aug 06, 2016 /	A great experience and a lovely ship.  I found it difficult to find my way around due to the size of the ship.  I wanted more comedy shows.  I only wish the excursions, and drink packages weren't so expensive.
4.0	Sail Date: Aug 06, 2016 /	Oasis of the Seas is a great ship to visit.  Food not the best, however ok. Fantastic entertainment with above average service.  Destinations provided were as good, however to book another cruise on the same ship it must have other destinations.
5.0	Sail Date: Aug 06, 2016 /	"Our room attendant was just above and beyond the best.  Kept everything clean and up to date his name was Mark.   

 

Our waiter was extra nice and seen that we were took care first class and his name was Caesar.  

I was not too impressed with the furniture on our balcony as I didn't think it was as comfortable and on other Royal Caribbean cruises I have been on.  

The only complaint I have is for room service.  Two different we ordered we did not get all we ordered.  We called and they brought it to us but we were done eating by then.   So that was the last of our room service.   

 

Royal Caribbean is my favorite ship as this was the 4th time with them.  I am a gold member now but don't know when I will move up."
5.0	Sail Date: Aug 06, 2016 /	This ship was amazing! The staff was exceptional. The food was amazing! The onboard activities and shows were fabulous! Our 7 day cruise was by far our best vacation!
5.0	Sail Date: Aug 06, 2016 /	"My husband and I enjoyed the cruise from our first lunch at Windjammers to the last breakfast at the same place.  The variety of activities gave us plenty to do, but we especially enjoyed the ice show and the aqua show.  In the evenings, we enjoyed strolling through ""Central Park"" and enjoying the violin and keyboard music.  Our granddaughter even danced a little for them and was well received.  We enjoyed exploring the ports, and I liked sitting on my balcony and looking at the water.  The guide on the Discovery cruise in Haiti was especially informative and funny.  We enjoyed shopping in Cozmel.  However, if we hadn't attended the information session with Kevin, we would never have found the Forum - a great placed to shop and eat.  My husband said it was the best Mexican food (Pancho's Backyard) he had ever eaten.  We had a wonderful week."
5.0	Sail Date: Aug 06, 2016 /	I liked the ship but it was overwhelmingly huge! I'm still not sure that after 7 days I saw everything on the ship! I had a bad experience with one of the restaurants where they had asked me if I had any food allergies and explained that I had a nut allergy. They served me a dessert with nuts after I specifically asked if it had peanut butter in it and was told no. I ended up at the medical facility on board although I did not have a severe reaction. The medical crew was thorough and professional. I felt it would have been a good gesture for the ship to not charge me for my dinner that evening.
5.0	Sail Date: Jul 30, 2016 /	I was absolutely amazed with the service and personnel, could not have asked for better service.  There is so much to do that it was hard to decide which show to take in.
5.0	Sail Date: Jul 30, 2016 /	"My saying to fellow travelers.  If you are board on this cruise, it is your own fault.  There are plenty of activities and specialty dinning room.  Show are good.  My family really enjoyed this trip.  I was a first for 3 of the 7 in our party.

 

They mentioned that would like to do another cruise someday."
5.0	Sail Date: Jul 30, 2016 /	The dinning  at the The America Icon with great waiters like Lisa and her assistant waiter( OUTSTANDING SERVICES)and the state room shows ABSOLUTELY WONDERFUL. The poolside , music, walking in Central Park and the all atmosphere. Highly recommend all friends and family to go on this particular vessel. 5 STARS ALL THE WAY
4.0	Sail Date: Jul 30, 2016 /	"Our seventh cruise as a couple was wonderful! This was our first cruise as a large family! Our parents first cruise adventure ever!  They had a wonderful time. The ship was impressive and offered many activities for all ages! We enjoyed the Central Park strolls, the Promenade pizza stops and pub stops, the ice skating rink, the Love and Marriage Show, the parades the dining in Silk Each evening. 

The Balcony rooms were very nice and gave us a wonderful view of each of the islands we stopped at. The room attendant made certain our room was always tidy and clean! Loved that! The casino royal was a blast for all family members from slots to craps!  

One disappointment was the increase in the drink packages. A year ago the packages seemed to be in the $45 range for the Premium package. This time they were $59.00 plus 18% tip and 7% sales tax. 

My choice whether to buy or not to buy, though..... 

Also missed the Sky Bar area.Used to love this location for the view of the ship and the feel of luxury.  It has been turned into an exclusive dining area and social area for the suite guests. We were invited one evening there at the Coastal Kitchen for dinner. This was less than special... food ... staff and even atmosphere... did not feel special... too bad! 

 

Would travel on this ship again for certain! Had a wonderful time with our family! 

Truly an unforgettable first adventure for my parents! and for the rest of the family!"
5.0	Sail Date: Jul 30, 2016 /	Would definitely reccommend this cruise. Ship was awesome, staff attentive, food was great and lots of things to do. We weren't crazy about ST Kits. Really nothing there to do. We hiked the volcano and that took 5 hours. If we didn't do that I don't think it is worth getting off the ship
3.0	Sail Date: Jul 30, 2016 /	Having cruised with Royal Caribbean several times in the past and loving it, my experience with the Oasis of the Seas has got to be mediocre! Yes, this ship is huge! Yes, it's got everything! But what happened to the personal touch? I understand that they have to micro manage all the guests to make everyone happy but your on their ship for a number of days and you just want to be happy or pampered! Entertainment was spectacular! The rooms, public bathrooms, promenade, etc. were spotless! Staff, captain, cruise director, chefs, etc. where very accommodating and friendly. On the other hand, when your on a cruise day and everyone wants to go to the fitness center to work out, walk/ job on the treadmill or use the elliptical....well then you better have them working because 25% of the equipment were temporarily out of service and 45% were actually broken and non functional. Breakfast and lunch at the wind jammer was ok.. nothing to brag about.. .but I was upset with dinner! When I booked my dinner reservations on-line I was not given the option to do main dining. I had no choice but to do my time dining. It was ok when I was booking my activities because I incorporated my time dining in between the time slots. The Staff and Chef's were excellent as always! Accomodating! and Sincere! Choices for dinner I thought were very limited to what I have been used to and if you wanted something extra... there was a price tag that came with it... really? I remember when they had lobster night for dinner, all you can eat... people would take it to their rooms... but now there was a price tag. I guess as times change... company needs to change with the times. Overall  I love Royal Caribbean. I know lots of people that love the big ships.. I guess im not a fan! I will stick with the smaller ships.
4.0	Sail Date: Jul 23, 2016 /	Overall a great cruise.  Loved how it was so family oriented.  The staff was amazing.  The shows were mediocre but we did enjoy the comedy show.  Loved the performers at Dazzle.
5.0	Sail Date: Jul 23, 2016 /	"Royal Caribbean is truly a world class cruise empire. The ship itself (Oasis of the Seas) is amazing. We were able to see a full Broadway production (Cats), an ice show (amazing choreography), a water show, ate like kings and queens in the buffet and on-board restaurants, went for a stroll in the park (on the ship!) and sunned ourselves on the front solarium upper deck! They really keep you entertained and busy).

 

The ports of call were nice. St Maarten has a great shopping district within a short walk or ride from the dock. Our snorkeling experience could have been more unique. The venue was a short kayak paddle to a neighboring resort beach and then swim out to the reef, I guess I expected a more secluded location. San Juan was a great visit, seeing both the old and new sections. On a summer excursion I would recommend this as just when you get hot from walking, you get back on the bus to cool down! Te old fort was impressive! Lebedee had the best beaches (bring water shoes thou, the rock under the sand pokes out some). The wave runner ""tour"" was more like a wave runner jaunt in the water, so we did not really ""see"" anything out of the ordinary as they stayed within a mile of the port. It was a nice to experience riding on one of these motorcycles for the water though!

I would recommend this trip to anyone. Now looking for my next trip with Royal Caribbean!"
5.0	Sail Date: Jul 23, 2016 /	"My favorite part of the cruise was being with my family; Oasis' atmosphere, luxury, and attentive staff enhanced the experience!  It's hard to select ""favorite"" because there are so many to choose from but I'll name a few!  Going to the Atlas bar at night and listening to the singer was FUN!  We met Andrew and Bill, the waiters and soon began a friendship.  Every night we would end our evening there laughing with these two wonderful men.  Dinner was also a favorite because of the staff, Ryan and I Puto.  The dinning room was beautiful, spacious but not loud and uninviting.  We were treated like royalty with a warm personal touch!  This service carried to our stateroom, Keith saw to our every need and even anticipated accommodations! Our room was always tidy and inviting.  The bed was so comfortable and the sheets luxurious, I slept well!  It was a wonderful, sweet trip that I fondly will remember and we are going back!"
3.0	Sail Date: Jul 23, 2016 /	"There are not too many positive words I can but to this cruise.   

The food was a ZERO in the main dinning breakfast  lunch and dinner etc.

went to  two special dining  150 Park Ave  and  Chop Steak House good

but not exceptional.   The crew members were amazing and the ship itself was a site to be seen.  We are glad we saw it but do not believe we would return.

TV also a ZERO and paid movies crazy."
5.0	Sail Date: Jul 23, 2016 /	Though the ship is large it's easy to get around, with lots of public areas.  Comfortable dining options, great pools and lots of great activities for both kids and adults!  If you get bored on this ship look no further than your own self.  The employees at our company, www.bullet-necklace.com , enjoyed their vacation and we can't to take them again next year!
4.0	Sail Date: Jul 23, 2016 /	"Entertainment was first rate. I would give the ship 5 stars, except the food quality was very bad.

I do NOT like to complain, the food was 3rd rate. The staff was very helpful, and we really enjoyed the cruise.Some how, they must have cut their food budget way too low."
4.0	Sail Date: Jul 23, 2016 /	There has been a lot of changes on the Oasis in the last 3 years. Many of the amenities are no longer being done.. I enjoyed my vacation, however I would like to see themed nights return at least one night of a ship party.
5.0	Sail Date: Jul 23, 2016 /	This was our first cruise for my husband and two young kids.  We loved every part of the cruise especially the amazing service by the crew and staff.  One very minor thing to note is the arcade (which we frequented often because my son loved it), many of the games didn't work.  Out of 3 air hockey tables, only one consistently turned on when we swiped the card.  Other games would take the money from the card but wouldn't start.  The arcade games are not all fully functional.  That's the only thing (don't want to call it a complaint) that surprised me.  WE LOVED EVERYTHING, it was an amazing cruise!
4.0	Sail Date: Jul 23, 2016 /	Our group felt like we were at the mall on deck 5 not a cruise.  Smooth sailing.  We enjoyed our vacation.  I would improve the bistro meal and service.  For a beautiful place it needs improvement.
5.0	Sail Date: Jul 23, 2016 /	We love Royal Caribbean!!! They are by far our favorite cruise line! We have been on several of their cruises now and they have never disappointed us! This was our 2nd time on Oasis of the Seas and we loved it just as much the 2nd time as the first! The food is exceptional, the entertainment is great, the staff is attentive and professional, and there is plenty to do onboard.  Royal Caribbean's private island Labadee has come all long way since we were several years ago. They have really made it so nice. We would definitely recommend Royal Carribean to others and I'm sure we will be sailing again with Royal Caribbean again - hopefully sometime soon!
5.0	Sail Date: Jul 16, 2016 /	"Everything was excellent, the ship was impressively beautiful, luxurious.  Food was amazing.  Best vacation.

stateroom was small but very cozy and well arranged

food was excellent

staff service outstanding

shopping experience great

shore tours were very good"
3.0	Sail Date: Jul 16, 2016 /	This was the 2nd time on this ship in 3 years and the first time was the best time. This time was awful we spent most of our cruise down at customer service very bad they need to really work on there services. We ate at the windjammer all week very good food and service. I think on formul nights you should Beable to eat at all the restaurants without haven to pay for it. The pool bar of course was awesome again  Bailey Steve, guido, Vernon and Marvin are the best bartenders on that ship. The only thing is they don't do the drink of the day  need to bring that back. The house keepers were also very good room was cleaned and changed twice a day. Prices have gone up a lot . Excursion in Mexico we just went shopping we spent most of our time waiting for Weston Union to open up. But Mexico was very nice we would love to go back. Jamicia we went to dolphin cove that was amazeing. We want to o back there to cause the cruise does not give you enough time on the ports, by the time we came back from dolphin cove we had to rush in a couple stores never got to see that whole port at all. Haiti was beautiful also we went to the beach and my girls did the zip line. When we arrived nothing was ready to go the tram was not running lots of walking there and it was very hot, the beach we went to was very rocky. Also we went to go and get soda at 1030 was not open yet but they were going around with alcoholic beverages. The food was awful. On this port cause it's Royal carribean private island we pay enough for the vacation alone we should not have to pay extra to go on the beach without rocks or pay 35.00 to have 2 chairs under a tent. I will not tell any of my family and friends to cruise the oasis of the seas.
5.0	Sail Date: Jul 16, 2016 /	"The boat and staff were wonderful. It was a little weird being on a boat and feeling like youre on land.

 

I am 25 and my wife is 23 and there werent many people our age. And I dont think any of them paid to be there. 

 

The shows were fantastic and the food was even better. 

 

The excursions were very touristy, but what can you expect from cruise destinations?

 

All in all it was a wonderful experience, though personally, next vacation will probably be an all inclusive resort with snorkeling :)"
4.0	Sail Date: Jul 16, 2016 /	The first few days are overwhelming.  It is a huge ship and there are a lot of things going on (maybe too much, it's hard to make it to all the events you would like to try).  The food is good, I hate how much is wasted.  Some of the meals featured in the dining room is also in the buffets but it is nice to sit down to a nice conversation and not be surrounding by kids running around (which seems to be a thing that some parents find acceptable).  Be mindful that not everyone has good manners, but you are on vacation...try to ignore it!  Plenty of space to hide away, the ports were beautiful.  Make sure you have something planned for Falmouth since there is nothing there.  The private island is also good, nice and relaxing.  You don't have to do anything but bring your towel.  I did not purchase any of the extra island activities.  Walking around and playing on the beach was enough for me.
4.0	Sail Date: Jul 09, 2016 /	"It is a beautiful ship, but for a 79 years old  Lady with a bad knee is too big.  Much to much walking.  I like smaller ships.  This was our 25th Cruise.

We where a Family of 23  but we got lost so many time.

The Grand kids loved it.

The Entertainment was excellent.  At dinner we could had more chose.

But in all,  it was a good vacation"
4.0	Sail Date: Jul 09, 2016 /	"All the shows were very professional & entertaining.  Watching ""Cats"" was just like sitting in a Theatre in Broadway!!  Lots of fun things to do & keep you occupied while on the ship & great selection of excursions at each Port.  Only issue was that we had to pay $25 extra per person to get a nice ""HOT"" dinner at Giovanni's.  We understand that it's a large ship with over 6000 passengers, but the appetizers & dinners were always served warm or just luke warm.  Not very appetizing, especially when paying top dollar for a week at sea."
5.0	Sail Date: Jul 09, 2016 /	"The Oasis of the Seas is a marvelous ship.  The crew treated us with outstanding personalized service.  We love vacationing on RCC!

There was a pilot of a new main dining menu that was a step down from our previous experience.  We prefer the former.

Ready to plan our next ROYAL CARIBBEAN vacation."
5.0	Sail Date: Jul 09, 2016 /	My favorite part of the cruise was just having so much available to do (or not) for my family.  I was traveling with my son and mother and they both had plenty to do and plenty of time to relax as well.  Perfect combination.
5.0	Sail Date: Jul 09, 2016 /	We have been on the Oasis 4 times and love this ship. The entertainment is exceptional on the boat. We had to do the my time dining on this cruise- I like the main seating much better.
5.0	Sail Date: Jul 09, 2016 /	This ship is huge, but not once did we ever have to wait for anything or feel like we were on this big ship. Recommend this cruise to anyone who enjoys cruising.
4.0	Sail Date: Jul 09, 2016 /	"Second time with royal carribean ( 3 time with others). I am not asking for luxury food but atleast make a good food in main dining. some days buffet was better than main food.

 

with that out of the way , everything else was good"
5.0	Sail Date: Jul 02, 2016 /	"The Crew treats everyone like Royalty.

The Cabin air conditioning could be better.

So much to do.

The ship could not be prettier.

I would definitely recommend & can't wait to go again."
5.0	Sail Date: Jul 02, 2016 /	"The ship was very large and presented virtually every good entertainment feature from other cruise lines.  We used the climbing walls, the Flow Riders, the Zip line, numerous pools, the elevated lounge and the hot tubs.  We also thoroughly enjoyed the Solarium and the Spa.  Our kids and grandchildren also thoroughly enjoyed the promenade, the Dream Works characters, the parade, the shopping and the various water themed entertainment and activities. 

 

The food was good.  Specific kudos are offered for the filet mignon, lobster and fish cake, all of which were offered once without premium charge.  The soups, both the onion and lobster bisque were very disappointing as was a lot of the beef entrees as the meat was tough.  Some of the desserts were very good!

 

The shows were the best I have seen on any of our 21 other cruises.  The talent was excellent and the shows were spectacular including the Ice performance, the acrobatics, the Aqua Pool events and the Broadway quality full production of ""CATS"".

 

The exercise facilities were excellent with very modern, plentiful and fully functional workout equipment.  The Walking/Running track was the best I have experienced.  It fully circled the ship on Level 5 so the track was large, shielded from the sun and level.  

 

The cabins were well appointed.  The showers were the best I have experienced and my wife liked the fact that she could even shave her legs in it with ease.  The closet configuration needs optimization.  It is not user friendly for hanging clothes.

 

I had the feeling that we were being charged for a lot of extras at premium prices. The photo package was very highly priced relative to other cruises we have taken so we took the majority of the pictures with our own camera and simply purchased a couple of professionally taken formal-night poses.

 

The embarkation process was very accommodating in contrast to the disembarkation process which was not very efficient and required standing in long circuitous lines for in excess of an hour.  (If I had it to do over, I would not have put the bags out the night before and would have instead simply taken the expedited checkout where you simply pull your own bags on the day of disembarkation.)

 

I would give the cruise a 9 out of 10 and would be happy to cruise again on the Oasis of the Seas."
3.0	Sail Date: Jul 02, 2016 /	"La atención del personal de recepción fue excelente, destaco se han preocupado y ocupado por resolver nuestros problemas, que al no hablar en inglés han sido multiples.

En el comedor The Grand 4ta planta la atención de nuestro camarero y especialmente la actitud solidaria del personal han sido muy buenas.

Negativo: he necesitado acudir al centro de atención médica por un cuadro de asma y bronquitis, siendo atendida en la sala de espera por una persona que no era médica. Recetando una medicina me ocasionó un efecto colateral adverso.

No es recomendable para personas que no hablan inglés."
5.0	Sail Date: Jul 02, 2016 /	My favorite part of the cruise was just BEING ON THE SHIP!  My stateroom seemed a little tight but it was because I overpacked!  Loved my balcony!  Loved shopping on the ship!  Loved the Art Auction!  The crew was friendly, professional and always ready to assist in making our cruise remarkable.  The Spa services were heavenly.  I booked my next cruise while I was on the ship!  That should tell you that I highly recommend Oasis of the Seas and Royal Caribbean.  It was our 5th cruise and now, on to the sixth!
4.0	Sail Date: Jul 02, 2016 /	Everything else was great!........................................................................................................................................................
2.0	Sail Date: Jul 02, 2016 /	"We are experienced cruisers. We owned a cruise only agency for 8 years and we chose the Oasis as the destination. We did not plan to even get off on any of the shore excursions. The ship is BIG and very, very nice. Many amenities plus 6400 fellow passengers on this trip. Why I did not like this cruise.

- Royal has upped their drink prices to outrageous levels. A beer is $6.95 PLUS 18% service charge PLUS they ask you for a tip! They are charging >$168 for a case of light beer or about a 900% markup!

-The extra charge specialty restaurants are not reasonable. The steakhouse has a $79pp upcharge. I can go to Ruth Chris, Morton's or Capital Grille for LESS.

- Entertainment requires reservations because the venues only hold about 25% of the ship's passenger capacities. The entertainment was good, but limited.

- I cannot recommend the ""anytime dining"". You still need reservations, BUT the reservation desk only answered the phone once out of five attempts over several days. The dining staff was excellent once you are seated.

- Food, except for the Indian food, was bland. Plentiful, but bland.

Finally, I should have known to expect this, but the ship was overrun with children. I am NOT criticizing here, but be prepared to deal with kids and teens."
5.0	Sail Date: Jun 25, 2016 /	I would highly recommend this cruise. Lots to do and see, you will not get bored. For the Falmouth, Jamaica portion of the cruise, you will be fine staying in the shopping area of port. we the red stripe beach excursion and it was not a good experience. other than that, awesome vacation cruise.
4.0	Sail Date: Jun 25, 2016 /	Wonderful trip and excellent service.  Food was good but meat quality wasn't as good as it has been in the past.  There are a lot of things to see on the ship! We really enjoyed the evening entertainment.  Make sure to see the aqua theater show.
2.0	Sail Date: Jun 25, 2016 /	ROYAL CARIBBEAN FOCUS IS IN THE QUANTITY NOT DELIVERING ON THE QUALITY. FOOD & ENTERTAINMENT WAS TERRIBLE.  ROYAL CARIBBEAN IS VERY OVERRATED.  THEY NEED TO FOCUS THE SAME ENERGIES AND MONEY THEY HAVE IN BUILDING THEIR MEGA SHIPS AND PROVIDING A PRODUCT WITHIN THEIR SHIPS.
5.0	Sail Date: Jun 25, 2016 /	I had very good time during this cruise would recommend to others.
2.0	Sail Date: Jun 25, 2016 /	"We were a group of 25, all carnival cruisers and were so excited to be sailing the Oasis of the Seas....yes, the ship is beautiful and clean....but we all agreed Carnival is 10 times better.

The staff is rude and rarely smiles...Royal makes you feel like it's more like a money making machine...

The entertainment ends early nothing like the fun carnival cruises....

Their photography staff is rude and lacks attention.

The food was ok, nothing to miss...,little variety on the menu and not the best presentation...

looking fw to cruising with Carnival again!"
5.0	Sail Date: Jun 25, 2016 /	The service was superior the entire trip. Our room attendant, Lambert, dinning room server, Roel, and all of the staff made us feel like a King and Queen. The staff at Izumi were amazing too and made our honeymoon very special. The food in the main dining and Izumi tasted delicious! We attended all of the shows and immensely enjoyed each and everyone of them. Glad that we reserved them in advance. We loved visiting Jamaica and having tour guide, Shamaree and bus driver Richard, Dunns River Fall guide Will and photographer Julian. Loved Haiti and the mile long zip line. Loved the locals at Cozumel, Mexico beach. Thank you Royal Caribbean!!!
3.0	Sail Date: Jun 25, 2016 /	Overall I had a good time, I bought an ocean view balcony for my girlfriend and myself for our second anniversary. The room was to be expected. There was like 5 channels on the television in english. Absolutely, everything on the cruise was an up-sell. They want you to pay for literally everything. The only free amenities are a few shows, most of the food, and pool access but other than that you're expected to pay for absolutely everything else. Also, I understand that 7000 people are being fed everyday but the amount of corner cutting that happens in the kitchen is unreal. With the amount of money that the cruise line rakes in there's no excuse for it. One of my meals said it came with mango coleslaw, however, when it arrived my chicken was garnished with wilted lettuce in a puddle of watered down mayonnaise, no joke. So the food experience was hit or miss. It was my girlfriend's first cruise so I didn't want to tell her my disappointment with some of the aspects. For the most part I didn't feel claustrophobic with the amount of people on board except when it came to the pools. The ship could definitely use a few more. The only time the pools weren't at capacity was after 5 when people started to filter out to get ready for dinner. All-in-all it was a relaxing time but I in no way felt that it was worth the exorbitant amount I paid. I won't cruise on this ship again and I hear all of Royal Caribbean's ships upsell everything as well so I'll probably go back to Princess in the future.
5.0	Sail Date: Jun 25, 2016 /	The staff went above and beyond. The entertainment was the best. The cabins are to small.Make all your reservations before you go. My waiter and his assistant in the American Icon were excellent , his name was Cesar
5.0	Sail Date: Jun 25, 2016 /	My favorite part of the ship really was how fascinating it was to be on such a large ship and it didn't feel like I was moving.  The Oasis of the Seas is truly an OASIS!!! My family and I had a wonderful time.  The staff and everyone was so friendly and helpful.
5.0	Sail Date: Jun 25, 2016 /	Reyland took Excellent care of our family of 10 nightly for dinner (Grand dining room 4th deck).  We truly appreciate his attentiveness, enjoyed his kindness and his singing was the icing on the cake! Great Service.
5.0	Sail Date: Jun 18, 2016 /	"My 21 year old daughter and I had a wonderful cruise.  Top praises goes to the staff!  They couldn't have been more helpful, and all seemed very happy, from our room being cleaned impeccably every day, to the restaurant/waitstaff/barstaff, and everyone around the ship, always had a large smile and personable greeting.  Shows were absolutely top rate, and I liked that they would add smaller shows (singers from Cats giving an impromptu Broadway song show).  Royal Caribbean did an awesome job and will definitely cruise with them again.  However, I'll pick a week when all children are in school!  The week before there were 5900 passengers, ours was 6300 and filled with children!  They were everywhere, running around yelling and screaming!Some of the passengers were very rude, not even acknowledging that you even said hello.  The configuration of the Windjammer Buffet seemed inefficient, people pushing and shoving running around the circular stations.  The Solarium is supposed to be a quiet adult section, however there were groups of 20-somethings (considered adults?) who seemed to be having a loud drinking party in the pool and spa; this is one thing I think should be enforced, since it is supposed to be sort of a ""retreat"" not a frat party!  Overall, we had a wonderful time and thoroughly enjoyed ourselves."
5.0	Sail Date: Jun 18, 2016 /	This was the best cruise that we have been on!  The ship is beautiful with something to do for everyone!  The food was excellent!  Can't wait to go back!
5.0	Sail Date: Jun 18, 2016 /	"It's a beautiful ship. It's the largest ship we have taken but loved it. There are a lot of shows to see and things to do. Never boring. I would definitely go on this ship and itinerary again. Drew was a great cruise director.

The only thing I would probably change next time would be choosing a designated time for dinner. We chose the anytime dining and had to wait every Eve to be seated. We didn't wait long but still was different from what we were used to. 

 

Excellent ship and vacation!"
5.0	Sail Date: Jun 18, 2016 /	We had a great time!  Group of 12 and we were able to have dinner together nightly, shows, and fun time during the day.  There was so much to do, we didn't get to do it all!  The cruise director on Oasis of the Sea is awesome, very funny and energetic.  The crew was amazing, we loved our dining staff...really will miss them.  I probably wouldn't do 7 days again, 5 would be plenty.  Loved everything, the only downside we experienced was with our kids 18-20.  We had a 16 year old cousin with us and they couldn't hang out at teen clubs or adult clubs together.  Should really have something geared towards this age group.
4.0	Sail Date: Jun 18, 2016 /	"There was alot to do. Met some nice people.

The food wasn't as good as it used to be. And i felt like you sohould be at least able to get coffee and such anytime of day or night. I am an early riser and i want coffee at 4 am. The morningwe wwre leaving the shio especially. I also had no wheel chair for express check out and struggled until my legs gave out. There was a person in photo who was very rude to me and i doubt it was dealt with. His name was Jason"
5.0	Sail Date: Jun 18, 2016 /	Great way to create good memories and connect family. Variety of opportunities for fun enhanced cruise for all ages. Friendly, helpful cruise staff in all areas. Couple of premier over the top cruise staffers!  We will cruise with Royal Caribbean again. Maybe go back to a smaller option we have selected in past.
4.0	Sail Date: Jun 18, 2016 /	"This was our 3rd cruise on RCL, and it was definitely the best!  The Oasis of the Seas is a fantastic ship! The different neighborhoods are a lot of fun, though we found ourselves drawn to the Royal Promenade for shopping or having a cup of coffee, while relaxing and people watching.  We also enjoyed the comfortable, yet also dynamic atmosphere of the Schooner Bar with the always smiling and dancing cocktail waitress.  It was quite nice to enjoy the adults only Solarium area at the bow of the ship, though something needs to be done about what seems like day-long reserving of lounge chairs, since signs are posted stating 30 minutes max without chairs being occupied.  We could have also left our towels on the chairs in a great location we found relatively early in the day, but that would not have been fair to other passengers who may not be early risers.  So what could be better on the Oasis?  For one, the food could be better.  We had dinner in the main dining room every night, and we were pleased with the food quality about 75% of the time.  Service was always quite good, even excellent at times, but we did not like all the dishes.  We enjoy gourmet food, and we just didn't get that consistently.  Also, the food at the Windjammer did not seem as good as we remember it from the Freedom of the Seas.  The selection and quality were good, but not great.  This was our first cruise with two teenagers, our son and a friend who had their own cabin.  While they had a fantastic time on the cruise, the teen program is in definite need of improvement. The intentions seem good, and the program looks good on paper, but in reality and execution, some changes need to be made.  For starters,  the meet & greet event on the first night hardly gave the teens the opportunity to actually meet and talk, and I think this set the tone for the remainder of the cruise.  We were all excited about the ""Prom Night"" dance on the evening of the last formal night, and this turned out to be a big let-down, with hardly any participation, in part because the event was just not promoted, or communicated effectively.  Perhaps Royal Caribbean could create an online focus group, consisting of teens who have cruised and been part of the program, in order to make improvements.  To close on a positive note, we always felt comfortable with our two teens having the freedom to roam about the ship until the 1:00 am curfew, and they had the time of their lives!  The Oasis of the Seas is a great ship for adults and teens, and the three days at sea give you the opportunity to do as much or as little as you please onboard.  I would highly recommend the Oasis of the Seas!"
4.0	Sail Date: Jun 18, 2016 /	Lots of walking and things to do and see. Great food but few vegetables in dining room, which was very crowded. Get there by 5:30 pm. Chops Grille OK but not out of this world. Buffet offered great selection and cooked superbly for anyone's desire. Shows over rated. CATS music beautiful and not too loud, costumes very enjoyable to see and the dancers movements very pleasing to watch, their voices were lovely, however their speech was hard to understand and left the story too hard to follow.  CATS is too long and most people left after the first hour, for that was long enough to enjoy the music, dancers, etc. Ship very stable (little rocking), in fact you'd not know it's a ship unless you went where you could see the water. Young children had excellent program, and teens also from morning til midnight.
5.0	Sail Date: Jun 18, 2016 /	"I loved every minute of this cruise and can't wait to repeat.  

 

I've never been on a ship where everyone was smiling and pleasant ALL The Time!

Staff was warm and welcoming and eager to make their guests feel at home.  Superior waiters in My Time Dining (Ben and Alex), a dedicated jazz room featuring Perry Phillips Quartet, CATS, Come Fly With Me and the Aqua Show gave us many choices of how to spend our time (or not)."
5.0	Sail Date: Jun 18, 2016 /	Booked the cruise with American Airlines as a honeymoon package, but somehow, it was not communicated to Royal Caribbean so we never got the romance treatment that we were expecting. Oasis of the Seas, however, was very welcoming and relaxing. This is our second time cruising with RCCL and this is the sister ship of Allure. Had a wonderful experience there and so did over at Oasis. They had the best and most outstanding crew. The shows were just spectacular. We will be lifetime RCCL cruisers, will be going on Harmony next year!
5.0	Sail Date: Jun 11, 2016 /	My favorite part of the Cruise was the dining. Once my kids discover the WindJammer Restaurant they did not want to go anywhere else. There should have been a variety of juices that were pleasing to the palate (sugar) Kids are not into Kiwi-Strawberry water, Fruit Punch is a better option. I do believe that the soda should be included to make a better all inclusive vacation. Also educating the entire staff about Autism would be a plus. Overall it was a beautiful vacation and I would definitely recommend it to others.
3.0	Sail Date: Jun 11, 2016 /	Ship itself is great... Third time on the Oasis.  Not going to do a fourth ... And if we cruise again will be trying another cruise line going forward.  Staff could certainly use some polishing up on service skills.  From the bartenders to the port of call at Labadee staff... I rarely saw a smile and never a thank you.  Very disappointed.  Food was mediocre at best.  Maybe the staff was up to their limit of dealing with a majority of rude and inconsiderate people.  My family and I were appalled at the caliber of people on this sailing.  So many rude and self-serving nasty people.  A sign of the downward spiral of our society of people these days.  How sad.  We may not even cruise again just to keep away from crowds of people I would rather not spend my valuable time with.  Disappointed on this cruise on so many levels.
1.0	Sail Date: Jun 11, 2016 /	The coupons for our cruises came home late.  We didnt receive the coupon book till after we got back home.  We left for our cruise in the mid afternoon on the 10th of June and our cruise was on the 11th.  It was very disappointing to come home to see the coupon book after our cruise!!!
5.0	Sail Date: Jun 11, 2016 /	Would recommend!  Amenities,ports of call and dining experience excellent!  Multiple activities for all ages!  My teenage sons enjoyed the flow rider, teen club, workout facilities and icing skating rink!  The shows were also fabulous! We saw the Broadway show Cats which was fabulous!
4.0	Sail Date: Jun 11, 2016 /	"My favorite part of the trip was the beautiful theme park settings such as ""The Boardwalk, Central Park, the Solarium etc."" Beautiful ship and wonderful staff. I would personally like to praise and thank our waiter and assistant waiter who were amazing in spite of complaints they were getting from other people or tables. They were terrific. Veronica was our waiter and Nefi the assistant waiter. They are to be commended for a job excellently done. The disembarkment time needs to be worked on and took much to long. Also on the first day of the cruise there were very long lines waiting to get into the windjammer and this was my first cruise waiting on a long line. Thank God it let up from then on although we made it our business to be eating breakfast by 8:30am the latest and when we left the area there were long lines. Very disturbing. The last complaint is that we wanted to go to the Rain forest in Puerto  Rico but was told there was not enough time as were many of the excursions that were cancelled. Bad news and very upsetting to think you travel so far away to see something beautiful and don't get a chance to see it."
5.0	Sail Date: Jun 11, 2016 /	"Favorites were lots to do, Good Food, Good Drinks....Would like to see correct menu on TV in room...Have more Chocolate Chip cookies

4.0	Sail Date: Jun 11, 2016 /	The Oasis is a great ship for teenagers.  My grandson enjoyed the flo rider, basketball court and table tennis.  We both had great fun playing Bingo.  It was nice having so many choices for meals, always easy to satisfy both our wants.  Although the itinerary we took was disappointing, the ship was great.  All of the staff and crew were extremely friendly and helpful.  Shows were entertaining and enjoyed by us both.
5.0	Sail Date: Jun 11, 2016 /	Royal Caribbean will take care of your every need.  Wonderful crew, beautiful ship and all the amenities. The port of calls were beautiful and the time at each port was sufficient.  I highly recommend this cruise.
5.0	Sail Date: Jun 11, 2016 /	This was buy far the best experience we have had on a cruise ship. The amenities were top notch, entertainment was amazing and constant, and the food was incredible. We have cruised with Norwegian and Carnaval in the passed and this surpasses them by far. The ship was truly amazing and at times you forget that you are even on a boat.
5.0	Sail Date: Jun 11, 2016 /	Oasis of the Seas is a beautiful ship and the service was great! So much to do on the ship. The only thing I disliked was that we didn't have much time in San Juan, Puerto Rico so I felt rushed and I couldn't enjoy myself. The ship docked around 7am and we had to be on board at 1:30pm. I had the most fun in Labadee, Haiti.
4.0	Sail Date: Jun 04, 2016 /	"nice cruise for relaxing.  Entertainment was ok, not as good as when traveled on sister ship allure of seas.  Also ship did not have same sauna shower for use as does the Adventure of seas class. 

I did like the track and used it daily.  Late night snacks not as many choices as some other ship. 

Also did not like the gratuity that is added to my bill.  This needs to be addressed.  Gratuity should be rewarded per service and not as a wage.

As a platinum member I still do not see any benefits for the program and now I will be open to other cruise lines and not stay loyal to Royal."
5.0	Sail Date: Jun 04, 2016 /	the whole experience of the cruise was amazing. I really needed the time away from every day life and so did my sister. We had a ball. The staff was great once they met you they remembered your name through the whole cruise. The drinks were great and the dinners were as well. We seen CATS and it was awesome. We watched the NBA finals at the aqua theater and it was great to hear both teams being cheered for. If your looking to take your first time cruise like I was Royal Caribbean's OASIS of the SEAS is the was to go.
5.0	Sail Date: Jun 04, 2016 /	The service was amazing. The cruise exceeded my expectations. Definitely going back. The waiters in the main dining room were very committed to providing great service. The stateroom attendant was very professional and polite. The crew was very friendly ans helpful.
4.0	Sail Date: Jun 04, 2016 /	"This was our 26th cruise. We have been on several different lines. Royal Carribean and Celebrity are our favorites. This ship is absolutely spotless and the crew just wonderful. The food was very good and a huge variety to choose from. The destinations were nice but, except for Mexico, not representative the the real condition of the country. The ports are 'disneyfied'. Safe and strile.

My only complaint is the charges every time you turn around, and drink prices are the highest in the industry. The drink packages are absurd. Speciality restaurants were over priced. Art sales are still a ripoff as they have been for years.

The captain rerouted the cruise to avoid bad weather and was a very smart thing to do. Weather was excellent due to his decision.

The cruise director his second were loud and fast talking. The stage show ""Cats"" was long and boring and the theater was half empty after intermission.

We will be back but on a different ship."
4.0	Sail Date: Jun 04, 2016 /	My experience on this cruise was awful. My minor sons father had she art attack while we were on the cruise at the age of 49. His current wife made two separate calls to the emergency cruise ship line and I never received the messages. My son was not able to see his father and have proper closure. I brought this to the attention of the front desk and they said they would look into it and get back to me. I heard nothing back.

If you can sleep on a rock, this is the room for you?

If your average size or large good luck in the bathroom in your room.  Your better off going to one of the public ones on the floor.

Staff was friendly and good, however they only really try to impress you the last 2 days because that's when they start their spiel for tips and doing the cruise survey.

Food is, for the most part bland and tasteless."
5.0	Sail Date: Jun 04, 2016 /	My favorite part Of the ship is The Boardwalk. Everythings in our ship are Amazing. The waiter in the dinner are the best. I recommend this ship. Excellent
5.0	Sail Date: Jun 04, 2016 /	"This ship is awesome and we love Royal Caribbean our two grandsons said it was the best cruise they had ever been on. Our travel agent Katrina Freeman did a awesome job getting it together. My only problem was with the dining options. I didn't get a choice of the dining I was given the my time dining. When I got on the ship I was told to go and talk to them later in the evening about reserving a time each night. When we went to dinner that evening after having traveling we had not changed clothes. My husband did have on a tank top and was told he couldn't go in. In the past on our first night we were never turned away from the dining room. I did go back to make reservations and was told I couldn't make nightly reservations in that dining room. Customer service was very helpful in getting us changed to another dining room. The disappointing part was as we were in that dining room several men came in with tank tops. 

RC has always had the best food than any other cruise line. I was disappointed in the Windjammer lunch and dinner. The selections were not near what that have been on the other ships. It didn't seem like it was big enough for a ship the size of the Oasis.

The Oasis is a beautiful ship with lots of neat things to see and do but I missed some of the special little things that are on the not so big ship. I guess for me bigger is not always better.

We will sail RC again but we will stick with a smaller ship and find somewhere else to cruise to, we have been to every Caribbean Island there is and some more than twice. We would like to try a Greece or Transatlantic. Thanks again!"
3.0	Sail Date: Jun 04, 2016 /	ship was very nice.  Getting on and off ship was very smooth. As far as the lines for shopping was very unorganized there were people everywhere.  I was in a bar asked the waiter for ice water, he walked away a never  came back. We went to others tables where others ordered alcoholic beverages. So I guess he just wanted a tip. I went to the bar and asked do you not serve anyone who orders ice water? Bartender said the waiter has a problem as he pointed to his head . Went on sail and snorkeling tour. The beer that was served was old and sweet, tasted discussing. As far as I'm concerned I will not be traveling with Royal Caribbean again!
5.0	Sail Date: May 28, 2016 /	My favorite part of the cruise was the endless amount of things our girls could do! They stayed very busy and enjoyed every minute of their trip! From the food to Adventure Ocean they had a blast. My personal feeling though is that with the class size of this ship you loose that feel for all the little extras that the staff usually does. We were celebrating a birthday on board and for two nights in a row in the dining room they forgot to acknowledge it! The dining room waiter and assistant were more than what we expected from previous trips though they did an amazing jib taking care of us! Also out stateroom attendant was out of this world amazing I feel the best we have ever had and we are Diamond Class cruiser with Royal! Overall ship was spotless and Central Park was so beautiful!
5.0	Sail Date: May 28, 2016 /	The whole ship was amazing, from the boarding to the disembarking at each port. It was our first time on a cruise and there was so much to do - almost too much that we didn't get enough time to just relax by the pool. We enjoyed the food, the specialty dinner packages, the drinks, the ports, the entertainment, the facilities, the casino, the bars and the spa and the pools.
4.0	Sail Date: May 28, 2016 /	Allure is a cleaner ship and had better service.  Both ships are identical in their set up. I felt I received better service from the Allure ship.  I witnessed and heard about 2 incidents on Oasis that customers were not happy or made a scene.  I think it was due to mean customers and not poor service.  I felt like I had a better experience in Allure but I would definitely go back in Oasis again.
4.0	Sail Date: May 28, 2016 /	"We absolutely loved the service on Oasis of the Seas! The cabin steward, bar staff, and waiters were incredible... attentive without hovering and quickly learned our preferences. In fact, our dining room service was so good that we cancelled our specialty dinner reservations!
We had massages on the first afternoon, right after leaving port, and I must say that was the best massage I've ever had! Plus, by booking it that afternoon we were able to get the service at a GREATLY reduced cost. I'll be doing that again!

As for communication in the terminal and in our cabin, a little signage could have gone a long way. Embarkation was horrific, and disembarkation on the final morning took HOURS. Also, it took us almost 24 hours to realize all of the information we could access on the TV in our cabin. Again, a little signage would have been very helpful.

Overall, I'd give this a 4.5/5 stars."
4.0	Sail Date: May 28, 2016 /	The Oasis is a nice ship but a little too big for my taste.  After a while I got tired of dodging people.  The food was good but not as good as I have had on past cruises on RC and other cruise lines.  The ship is clean, well maintained and the staff were all very nice and accommodating.  There were a variety of activities for the days at sea.  If you like bigger venues then the Oasis is the place to be.  I, myself, prefer the smaller ships.
4.0	Sail Date: May 28, 2016 /	"The boat was a lot of fun and had plenty of activities for kids as well as adults. The shopping they had was limited but definitely more upscale featuring Tiffany's jewelry, Michael Kors, and other shops along those lines. However, you do get great deals on liquor and other merchandise because it is duty free. Watch out for the little things though, I had to buy a box of Advil regularly priced at $4.00 was $12.00. The staff were very friendly and quick to pick up after you. The dinners in the evening that were included were all pretty good except for a few select entrees. The buffets for breakfast and lunch are a whole other story. We probably ended up eating 12 burgers between the two of us because it was the only thing that was edible. Also, one night we woke up in the middle of the night and decided to get a snack and literally nothing was open except a pastry shop that had two options that sounded awful. Another thing to look out for is after a certain time (not sure when, maybe midnight) they charge you $4.00 to order room service as a ""late night delievery fee"" which in my option is basically stealing from the customers because if nothing is going to be open late at night yet, the only thing thats open is room service and you're going to charge me for it? That's false advertising when it says ""24 hour all you can eat"". You can tell the cruise entertainment such as the Headliner Show was directed at the 35 and up age group. This was advertised as a family event yet within the first 5 sentences the performer was making fun of anyone under the age of 35 for not knowing specific artists from the 50's to the 80's."
2.0	Sail Date: May 28, 2016 /	The Oasis of the sea is very over priced  and a very poorly designed ship. While it is very pretty to look at it was poorly designed for a cruise ship. There were no windows and unless you had an outside cabin, were  dinning at the over crowded buffet or on the pool deck  you could not look out to the sea. The openess of the Central Park and Boardwalk neighborhoods made the hallways  on these floors very hot and muggy. To get to the upgraded restaurants we had to go through the uncovered Central Park and got wet from the rain. There was a limited amount of dinning options included in the price and the quality of the food at these venues was very poor! The dinning was very crowded.  The entertainers at the nightly shows were excellent however the amount and variety of other entertainment was limited. The kids club staff was great but compared to other cruise lines they closed early and charged for extended hours. Disembarking the ship was horrendous!
5.0	Sail Date: May 28, 2016 /	This being my second time on this ship with over 30 cruises under my belt makes for an experienced cruiser! The Oasis is a beautiful ship with so many options you may never leave and head to port! The entertainment available was spectacular and enjoyable with lots of laughter included! The comedy acts on this ship are some of the best in the entertainment industry. Great options for food as well.....and a must is Giavonni for some great Italian dining! The 150 Park Place is magnificent for farm to fresh choices and was my favorite dining spot this go round! The dining room offered great dining choices as well! Won't disappoint ! Even won some money in the Casino! Lots to do!
4.0	Sail Date: May 28, 2016 /	"The oasis of the seas is a beautiful ship. I enjoyed the food, the shows and the time spent with my wife relaxing. My wife and I had the pleasure of taking a tour of the kitchen galley and eating a brunch prepared by the chefs. The food was awesome!!!!  The only negative comment I had is regarding the room I had. The sofa was supposed to look green, but instead it looked black due to the dirt and grime and non cleaning of it. We asked our room attendant to cover it up with a sheet. He offered to shampoo it, but shampooing a sofa that looked that would have been a waste of time.  Someone needs to inspect these rooms at the end of each cruise and replace nasty looking sofas and chairs. 

 

I won't lets dirty sofa influence me from cruising with Royal. I truly love cruising on Royal Carribbean Ships"
5.0	Sail Date: May 28, 2016 /	"Loved every aspect of the Cruise, the staff, food, entertainment and of course the Ship!!! We had no problem booking the shows we wanted or any of the restaurant we wanted to eat at.  We had so many choices where to eat and also many places to go for entertaiment.

 

Looking forward to go again with the rest of the family!!!"
4.0	Sail Date: May 21, 2016 /	Such a nice bunch of people who work on that ship. Our waiter was the best one I've ever had after 21 cruises. His name was Ben and we had my time dinning. If you're lucky enough to Get him, you will be so pleased!  Only thing disappointing on this ship was trying to get to breakfast/lunch at the Winjammer Buffet...never got there, lines were too long!   They also need an omelette station.
5.0	Sail Date: May 21, 2016 /	The cruise was both fun and relaxing. Always something to do if you are interested. Food was excellent, wait staff was very attentive and accommodating. For those of you who may get seasick, this is the boat for you. Most of the time I didn't even feel it moving. All in all, we had a blast and would definitely do it again!
2.0	Sail Date: May 21, 2016 /	"We had usually cruised with Carnival.  We chose the Oasis of the Seas for something new and different.  We had fairly high expectations, since we were paying considerably more for our cruise.  This is what we found:

 

-The ship is beautiful.  It is well appointed and the neighborhoods were fabulous.

-Our cabin steward was attentive.  Exceptional service.

 

Now for the the disappointments:

 

-We have always used these cruising opportunities for professional photography for the family.  The scenes did not change throughout the entire cruise and the poses were the exact same for each photographer.  The photos were horrible.

-Food was mediocre, at best and 24 hour venues were very limited.

-Entertainment was less than thrilling EXCEPT for Lou Gazzaro, who was awesome.

-Ports of call had less than desirable excursions, so we went out on our own for the most part.  One excursion that was booked was cancelled. 

-On board activities were fairly lame.

-Long lines made getting to ticketed events a nightmare.

-Expense was about 3x what we normally spend.  Everything was more expensive.

 

Overall, I will not cruise RC again.  I'm looking for a new line to try."
4.0	Sail Date: May 21, 2016 /	cruise ship was very nice, clean great staff.  food was okay except deserts were dry with very little taste. otherwise wonderful time. the shows and entertainment were great.
4.0	Sail Date: May 21, 2016 /	Yes I will recommend it to others. We enjoyed our time in Mexico the most. Our service on the ship was A1. Ryan and Karl were exceptional every dinner service. Ricardo went over and above to make us feel right at home. And Raymond was a delight at World Atlas. He was our first contact on the ship; he set the bar very high. The meats could have been seasoned a bit more and I would have enjoyed more time at port.
5.0	Sail Date: May 21, 2016 /	What a fabulous ship!! The room was spacious.  So many things to see and do.  The staff was courteous, helpful, and personable.  The shows were spectacular.  Can't wait to go again.
3.0	Sail Date: May 21, 2016 /	"The entertainment and activities aboard the Oasis of the Seas was outstanding.  We had thunderstorms for most of our cruise but the great variety of things to do aboard made the voyage worthwhile.  The food was average.  Overcooked steak at Chops Grill (supposedly a premium restaurant) and VERY salty food at the Windjammer buffet.  Other than that, passable fare. 

Service was very, very disappointing.  We had reservations a Chops and waited 2 hours for our food after we ordered without seeing our waiter the whole time.  Then they made us feel like it was our fault for not realizing it would take so long.  We tried to make reservations for Coastal Kitchen which is a restaurant reserved for suite guests.  The reservation desk was supposed to be opened from 11AM to 3PM.  No one answered the phone.  When we went there in person we were told to come back at 5PM.  When we did they said they were booked for the evening.  We tried again another day with the same procedure only this time we got in.  When we got there the host was very rude to us. 

We like to speak to staff while were cruising.  Most of the time, the staff is very friendly.  On this ship the staff was either unfriendly or, when they did speak to us, it seemed like they just wanted to get off of that ship.  After a while we felt the same way.  The overall unprofessionalism of the crew was shocking.  This is definitely a management and leadership issue.  Great ship.  Poorly run."
5.0	Sail Date: May 21, 2016 /	"Jus returned off the Oasis May 21, 2016 sailing. The ship is something to behold!!! The ships condition is in top shape. The staff, service, entertainment and food is the best we've had in 11+ cruises. The ship is so well laid out, that even with 5000+ guest, and 2000 more workers onboard, the ship never feels crowded. Our room was on the 14th floor overlooking Central Park. This was a good location to get around the ship, but there is nice from deck chairs starting at 6:00am. There's also music from the Caribbean Band, Heat Wave in the afternoons, so if you're trying to take a nap to take in the night life, it will be hard. The noise didn't take away from our vacation, but this was the first cabin we had that didn't had cabins above or below, and we don't know how we missed that, but we wouldn't select that deck again (we would do another Central Park cabin on deck 12 or 11).

 

The ships pools or hot tubs were never crowded to where you couldn't enjoy them. Their Production of Cats was Broadway level, and I recommend you see this, along with the other shows (Frozen in Time, Come Fly with Me, and the Aqua Show) onboard.  The adults only Solarium was our place for breakfast most days, and the place to relax. We ate dinner in Chops Grille and the food was really good, and as we remembered it from our previous Royal cruise. IF your a drinker, get the drink package (Premium or Ultimate). It more than paid for itself with the unlimited drinks. 

 

We made this cruise mostly about the ship, and didn't do any excursions except to stretch our legs at the port and port shops. This cruise was an awesome experience, and we've already booked another cruise on the Oasis when she comes to Port Canaveral. 

 

I highly recommend trying out the Oasis, or one of her sister ships, the Allure or Harmony."
4.0	Sail Date: May 21, 2016 /	The ship was amazing and never left me wanting more to do.  There was plenty to do and see.  Shows were great and the staff was friendly as always.  Bar service was a little slow (especially considering I purchased the drink package).  We didn't know we had to schedule some of the shows in advance and wish there was better communication about the need to select show times.  However, Guest Services was more than helpful in resolving the issue and getting us into shows and performances.
5.0	Sail Date: May 21, 2016 /	central park view was excellent. The water fountain and the staff  i really enjoy myself  will recommended to anyone ....we need more activities for older people and also the water  i will prefer more bottles instant of glasses .... i had more good times than complain thanks much for a good service.
5.0	Sail Date: May 14, 2016 /	There were many favorite things on the Oasis of the Seas. Starting with the place we called home for  7 nights in a beautiful balcony ocean view room which appeared to be a large picture window. Our room attendant Carlos was great, had some back issues, the bed was a bit uncomfortable, the problem was quickly taken care of by Carlos by adding extra cushion to our bedding.  We loved, Central Park and the  Solarium, The shows we attended were excellent. Enjoyed the specialty restaurants. A beautiful ship!!!!!                                                                                                                  We would highly recommend this cruise to our family and friends
5.0	Sail Date: May 14, 2016 /	Relaxing!!!  I go on a cruise to get away from my worries.  Relaxing was important to me because I take of my mother and my grandson.  The ship is big enough if you want to be with people you can or if you want to be alone you can.  The only thing I don't like is people saving chairs when you are on cruise days even though there is a policy of 30 min which is not enforced.
5.0	Sail Date: May 14, 2016 /	"Amazing ship! The food was ok... not bad but not great... We went to three of the special restaurants and enjoyed the atmosphere but, found the food to be average.  Some of the wait staff in the bars acted as though you were bothering them/interrupting their day. However, we quickly found our ""regular"" people who were pleasant and were excellent in their interactions with us.  It was very easy and quick to get on/off at the various ports despite the number of people onboard.

 

 As previously mentioned, the ship was amazing.  I feel as though I've become a ship snob now.  I can't imagine going on a ship without all the bells and whistles that Oasis of the Seas had! Overall - best cruise we've ever taken and I'd go again in a heartbeat."
5.0	Sail Date: May 14, 2016 /	It's hard to say. Everyday was great. Enough chairs by the pool on see days. Easy to get on off ship while in dock. Easy to get around the ship. Great service.

5.0	Sail Date: May 14, 2016 /	This was my first cruise I have been on and I loved it! The staff was nice and friendly and there were always lots of fun activities to do on board. I enjoyed the nice adult only Solarium, and the running track on deck 5. Even though the ship had about 6,000 people, it never once seemed that crowed. I traveled with a large group of 12 and we didn't have many problems trying to find one another. I would go again in a heartbeat! I have never felt that relaxed on a vacation!
2.0	Sail Date: May 14, 2016 /	"The ship was beautiful.  Meticulously maintained.  The rooms were comfortable and cleaned multiple times per day.  I loved absolutely everything about the cruise, except...

 

The food.  Words cannot describe how horrible the food was.  It was akin to bad hospital food or school cafeteria food.  Even the premium restaurants you pay extra for were on par with an applebees.  Speaking with other guests who had sailed the same cruise before, the food seems to have gone down in quality over the last 6-9 months.  Which is really a shame.  Even though it's just one aspect of the cruise, it made it hard to enjoy since every meal was dreaded.  I got a smoothie for a couple meals from the Spa to avoid eating the terrible food and even skipped a few meals."

3.0	Sail Date: May 07, 2016 /	This was my third cruise. the first was on Norwegian, The second on Carnival, and the third on Royal Caribbean. I was not real crazy with the lay out of the ship. Don't get me wrong.. it was very beautifully done. they had the shops on the inside of the ship on a lot of the floors. they had  a ''central park''  that was beautiful, with trees & benches..what I wasn't crazy about was the fact that  they did not have many  decks that you could walk outside on. there were two decks..one of which was for running, and the other was on the top where the pools are. Also, instead of you paying cash in advance & then have them take your purchases out of your money.. they let you charge all you wanted.. but then had to pay at the end of the cruise. The room did not have it's own coffee maker.. or ice bucket.  the food, as always.. was good. Was a little disappointed when they did not have a ''chocolate'' night. where everything is made of chocolate & done so beautifully like the other 2 ships did.  The waiters in the Grand dinning room where really great & nice & very efficient. Also, when they used the load speaker to communicate.. it is very difficult to understand what they are saying.. Not sure if I will try Royal Caribbean again...Where I know as of right now... Wouldn't mind another Norwegian cruise. I am trying to try as many as I can.. But so far.. they don't size up next to Norwegian!!
5.0	Sail Date: May 07, 2016 /	It was our first time with royal, our family had a great time. Our kids enjoyed the daycare and our family loved the windjammer food for all 3 courses each day, nice variety with healthy options as well.
5.0	Sail Date: May 07, 2016 /	I was extremely impressed with every aspect of this cruise from the planning with my agent Alli Mclivenny through my return on shore. Ms. Mclivenny called me the day before sailing to review my status and ensure that everything was in order. The staff at port and on the cruise were all pleasant, curtious, professional and helpful. The food on the ship was the caliber of a five star cuisine. The dining room staff, waiter and assistant waiter were amazing as was our stateroom attendant. I highly recommend this cruise to anyone seeking an amazing cruise experience.
5.0	Sail Date: May 07, 2016 /	The Cruise was outstanding and the crew from the Officers to the other crew members were great. The only complaint I have is the very low quality of the room service breakfast. It was terrible with cold toast, hard bacon and something resembling scrambled eggs that tasted bad. This was the same as the last cruise I took on this same ship. With everything else being outstanding they really need to upgrade their room service breakfast.
4.0	Sail Date: May 07, 2016 /	Lots of entertainment. Lots of things to do. I don't agree that the Royal Caribbean charges for popcorn. Considering the cost of the cruise and the drinks on the cruise popcorn should be free or the kids.
4.0	Sail Date: May 07, 2016 /	"Overall, we enjoyed our cruise on the Oasis of the Seas.  It was nice that no tenders were required to go ashore, although we know that was due to the immense size of the ship.  This is not our first Caribbean cruise, so we did not sign up for any shore excursions, we just strike out on our own.  The on-board amenities were great, but you would expect that from a ship this size.

 

The meals were typical for a cruise ship, although we had two excellent experiences with the specialty Italian restaurant, Giovanni's.  They were approaching people waiting in line for anytime dining and offering discounts. Well worth the extra cost.  The main buffet was a madhouse, with the lack of available seating a constant irritation.  We opted for the beverage package, since we have been surprised by our bar tab in the past.  For anyone that likes to have cocktails before dinner, drinks with dinner and maybe cold beverages at the pool, we would highly recommend this option as well.

 

A new feature that we loved was the ability to check our bags through to our home airport prior to exiting the ship.  Kudos to Royal Caribbean for that one!  While other folks were schlepping their bags through customs, we only had a couple of small carry-on bags to deal with.

 

On-board shows and entertainment were very good, although we would recommend booking your reservations as soon as you board.  Some shows were already fully booked when we make our reservations, soon after an early boarding.

 

Final assessment is that even though we felt that Royal Caribbean did a very good job overall, we will be looking for smaller ships in the future."
4.0	Sail Date: May 07, 2016 /	We had a great time. The ship was beautiful and well maintained. Staff was friendly and welcoming. Just make sure you schedule your shows before you board the ship.
4.0	Sail Date: Apr 30, 2016 /	my favorite part is the whole crew took very good care of personal hygiene for each customer and room server assigned to my room was very helpful and provided excellent services.  The only thing disappointed me was the food wasn't impressive at all and plus the dinner room wasn't elegant enough to be equivalent to the dress code that was recommended.
5.0	Sail Date: Apr 30, 2016 /	Oasis of the Sea is perhaps one off the best Cruises I have been on.  First day was a bit confusing but when you are boarding, feeding and trying to find your way with 6300 plus people plus crew, one should expect a little confusion.  But that was only the first day.  After we set sail things leveled out and all was well.  We absolutely loved the shows.  They were expertly done and excellent performances.  The food was excellent and I looked forward to our dining each evening. We loved Park Central and the Boardwalk was great fun.  We will definitely look to Oasis of the Seas for a future Cruise.  The Spa was wonderful.  Enjoyed the two massages and would recommend them to everyone.  For a special treat try the bamboo massage. Our room was very nice. We had room to move and be comfortable in our room.  We loved the fact that there was very little movement off the ship. We only felt movement a couple short time's. Must off the time it was as smooth as glass on the Atlantic.
4.0	Sail Date: Apr 30, 2016 /	Although the service was excellent I do not like the idea of taking away the dining room as it was once.  We use to be assigned a table number and we ate there every night.  I had to wait up to 15 minutes to be seated and the same amount of time to get dinner.
3.0	Sail Date: Apr 30, 2016 /	Nice ship, Staff not like normal Royal Staff they don't seem to care and food all taste the same I think they try to push the pay restaurants. The Itinerary was Awesome, St. Thomas and St. Martin were Beautiful.
5.0	Sail Date: Apr 30, 2016 /	"This was a much needed vacation for my wife and I.  The Oasis of the Sea did not disappoint.  All of the excursions were great.  In Nassau we went to Atlantis.  We had a great time, but we felt it was a little over priced.  In St Thomas we did the Catamaran and snorkled with Turtles and other fish.  It was great and was well worth the money.  The staff was excellent and provided everything we needed.  In St Maarten we did the ATV tour.  This tour took us from the Dutch side to the French side and to orient beach.  We were not that impressed with the beach, but the ATV ride was great.  Would recommend any of these excursions.  On the ship, it was amazing.  Everything was perfect from the room to the service.  Spent most of the time in the Solarium area.  

Would recommend this cruise for everyone.

4.0	Sail Date: Apr 30, 2016 /	This is my 13th cruise.There was plenty of entertainment,but you had to plan a head before you cruised,most shows had to be booked ahead.No complaints about the food,food service,bar staff,Room was clean and good service.The diamond club and staff were great,no shortage of drinks.Did not like the short time that we were docked in the Bahamas,leaving at 1:30 in the afternoon is to short of time,
5.0	Sail Date: Apr 30, 2016 /	"We were a group of 11 on this magnificent ship for 7 nights.  Our overall experience was outstanding!   I relaxed, had scheduled events, and sight-saw--all on the ship!  Everyone was friendly and accommodating.  Food was FAB, we ate in the main dining room every night except for 1.  Marvin and Kadek, our dinner service attendants were fun and professional.  Shonwinn, our stateroom attendant was invisible but always ""there"".  I felt safe walking the corridors alone.

The only negative comment i have is that we were not able to coordinate our group because we didn't have capability to TEXT.   Buying the package was too much.  It's hard for me to believe that free text is not doable!!"
5.0	Sail Date: Apr 23, 2016 /	My boyfriend and I went on our first cruise with RC's Oasis and although we were originally skeptical about the experience we would have, it only took less than an hour to know we would love it. The ship is highly impressive and the service even better. Staff treat cruisers like royalty despite how unappreciative some guests may be. The food is amazing and there are plenty of options to choose from onboard. Giovanni's table is highly recommended! There are 21 pools/hot tubs, multiple bars offering different genres of music, dancing, a theater, comedy club, casino, shops, ice skating rink, rock climbing walls...the list goes on! If you didn't want to leave the ship, you wouldn't be bored. RC helps you find excursions at ports if you are feeling adventurous and they guarantee returning you to the ship on-time. Overall, we were positively overwhelmed by the ship and had a fantastic time! We believe we will now be cruisers for life and plan on staying with Royal Caribbean.
4.0	Sail Date: Apr 23, 2016 /	Overall the cruise was very enjoyable.  The cruise staff especially the room stewart and the dinner wait staff was excellent as always.  My only negative comment is that we enjoy the midsize ships more.  This ship is too large and obviously too many people for our taste.  No negative reflection on RC..
4.0	Sail Date: Apr 23, 2016 /	Always a pleasure to travel with RCCl!! we have been on many other cruise lines before and RC is our favorite. Embarkation and disembarkation were a breeze, the accommodations were very suitable, Food in the Dining room was excellent! did not care to much about breakfast in the windjammer best choice always for me was the dining room. The ship itself is absolutely beautiful with lots of things to do, but did not like the pool areas during sea days they tend to get very crowed and to many people hogging chairs by reserving them with just towels and them not even being there all day, they should come up with a better fair way so everyone can enjoy.
5.0	Sail Date: Apr 23, 2016 /	Went last week with two other couples and had a blast on this cruise.  Dining was great; drink package worth it; entertainment awesome.  You can either do nothing or as much as you want to on this cruise.  Highly recommend it!!!
5.0	Sail Date: Apr 23, 2016 /	"The ship was as beautiful as I imagined it would be with a few exceptions.

We like to do casual dining in the Windjammer but it was so crowded at times they had to ask people to leave.  Complimentary ""restaurants"" are is rare on this ship.  There is an up charge for everything.  No longer ""Drink of the Day"" specials, average cocktail is approximately $13 with all the fees. Little or no little live music early in the evening for us old folks.

Loved the ship but doubt that I'll do a ship this size again, too crowded (6,700 passengers)."
3.0	Sail Date: Apr 23, 2016 /	We took this cruise to get a feel of cruising on a monstrous ship of this size. We were disappointed with our experience. There is lot of people on board,every whee we go there is a line, whether we are at a buffet or on our time dining. The meals served are mostly salty and no taste. there are no more personal touch from the ship staff to passengers. We feel like they jsut want to do their job assigned and some do not smile. True as with a big ship there are lots of things to see and explore but it takes time. Our room steward was so nice to us and greeted us by our first name. He seems eager to help us. Most of the passengers we talked to said they will not come back to this ship. they have the same experience as we have.
4.0	Sail Date: Apr 23, 2016 /	Mostly a good experience.  The debark was not handled well and could certainly gone better.  One of the headline shows was cancelled because of technical difficulties and we were disappointed with that.  The pools are insufficient for the number of people on the ship.  During cruise only days it was virtually impossible to swim in the pool, if you were lucky, you could stand in it to cool off.
3.0	Sail Date: Apr 23, 2016 /	"Beautiful ship, but way to big with 6,350 passangers and you have to do a lot of walking. I can understand that you have to make reservations for everything you want to do and see, but if they are all booked or if they cancel shows (as they did with the aqua show) it doesn't make for a happy cruiser. As always RCCL's crews are the best, they go way out of their way to please you. This ship is a marvel at sea and worth it just to see and experiece it once, but for me I will go back to the smaller ships where you can just walk into any venue without the hassle.

17 Cruises, 8 with RCCL"
3.0	Sail Date: Apr 23, 2016 /	The ship is incredible, a true modern marvel! Lots to do on the ship and the stops were good. Shows were great, however the food was just ok and the service was pretty bad. I think since tips are prepaid, they tend not to care as much or try as hard. I always give extra tips if the service and or attitude of the person is good, however that was a rare find on this ship.
3.0	Sail Date: Apr 23, 2016 /	We were impressed by the beautiful ship, but thought the services fell short. We bought the soda package and noticed that the bartenders would go to others without the cup first. We are also used to lots of fun things going on by the pool (on other cruise lines), but that wasn't the case here. The ship was so big that it was easy to get lost... We would have liked to have seen the cruise director out and about more.   The dining room had good food, but the buffet was sub par at best.
5.0	Sail Date: Apr 23, 2016 /	It was a great experience traveling with Royal Caribbean. Every crew member llwe encountered was very friendly and helpful. That was our first cruise, but it was excellent. The oasis of the Seas is excellent in every way. I greatly recommend this cruise lines to any body  who is traveling. The Oasis of the Seas is  fully loaded.
3.0	Sail Date: Apr 16, 2016 /	Very disappointed when Royal Caribbean would not accept my room credit you guys had told me would be given to each room.  Because a family was not able to travel, they wouldn't let 2nd room have the room credit.  Also was shocked that they charged per person in the room to clean the state rooms.  Seems somewhat unfair when there is only 1 room to clean.  Felt charging per person was very unfair.  Wasn't as impressed with the guest services staff on this cruise as on my last cruise.
5.0	Sail Date: Apr 16, 2016 /	We were totally thrilled with the OASIS of the Seas.  The stateroom was nice.  The bathroom counter could have been higher - typical kitchen counter height.  The handicap cabins could have the lower counters.  The nightlight in the bathroom was great, very safe to get up in the middle of the night.  Loved the balcony, our favorite cabin.  Anxious for the move to Port Canaveral, we won't have to drive so far.  Will cruise again on Oasis.
5.0	Sail Date: Apr 16, 2016 /	We have always traveled on smaller ships so, we wanted to try a bigger ship for a change.  Well, there is only 1 more bigger ship (for now).  For starters the Oasis is a HUGE ship!  It rarely felt like it was packed with people.  We were always able to get an elevator without a problem, there were always plenty of lounge chairs around, the only place that felt crowded was the promenade on the sale days.  There are plenty of things to do around the ship for every level of activity.  The staff was very attentive.  Our room steward was so concerned when I had a minor mishap that he checked on me several times.  The main dinning room staff was terrific.  Our waiter Mannuel and his assistant Royen were always there before we knew it.  Manuel joked every night that his grandma made us a special dinner.  The ports were good, I enjoyed St. Thomas and St. Maarten,  Nassua was ok, the people were definitely not as friendly as the other ports.  I would most definitely cruise again on the Oasis or her sister ships.
5.0	Sail Date: Apr 16, 2016 /	Had a great time. Great service.......................................... clean.. dining waiter excellent.............................................................................
4.0	Sail Date: Apr 16, 2016 /	The cruise overall was terrific!  The main prominade on deck 5 was beautiful with great lighting and nice stores.  I really enjoyed the Central Park and the Central Park cafe.  It had really nice salads and the sandwiches were awesome!  The dining room we had was the Grande.  It was very formal looking and the waitstaff was top notch.  The pools and hot tubs were so nice and relaxing.  This ship is the best one I have been on.  Although the ship did rock quite a bit and left me feeling vertigo well after coming home.
4.0	Sail Date: Apr 16, 2016 /	"The ship was very nice and not crowded.  We give high marks to the staff at the atlas globe bar.  All were excellent especially Cory Sawyers.  Dining was excellent except we were seated in an aisle.  Wheelchairs were a problem as they could barely get by.  Our wait staff were excellent. Especially the head waiter.

Entertainment was first rate and the sets and venue were as well. There were numerous show times so everyone should have made it.  All of the clubs had great atmosphere and friendly staff. 

Our room was always in top shape and we were never had to wait.  Not sure how he did that!"
4.0	Sail Date: Apr 16, 2016 /	This was a great cruise! The ship stayed clean, the staff were friendly, great shows/events on the ship, and organized. However, alcohol/wine/beer/soft drinks were an extra fee ($30-70/day) as was the wifi... I just wished they offered alcoholic drinks OR wifi complimentary. Also, there were 5,400 cruisers and over 2,000 staff so the lines to do things on the ship, include restaurants were really long. However, it was still a great experience and I would recommend Royal Caribbean to friends and family!
4.0	Sail Date: Apr 16, 2016 /	Food was amazing. Drinks were amazing. (If you're a drinker, the drink packages are worth it). The entire staff was friendly and helpful. Lots of things to do. The only downside was that it's a BIG boat and a lot of people. Takes a minute to get the hang of navigating things. And for us, the ship swayed almost the whole time- that was likely because of the weather though.
5.0	Sail Date: Apr 16, 2016 /	"Enjoyed everything. We have traveled on several Royal Caribbean Cruise Lines in the past and enjoyed the pleasures on each vacation cruise vacation.

 

Thank you."
3.0	Sail Date: Apr 16, 2016 /	"Check in congratulations best ever.  Getting off ship needs lots of work.

My time dining everything but my time needs lots of work.

Piano bar evening entertainment worse ever we have cruised several times now and this girl was horrible.

Shows top shelve.

Ship design unique.

No liquor available in room wet bar.  What are you thinking?

Too much emphasis on specialty dining.

Over all very disappointed with our cruise.

Hope this survey doesn't fall on deaf ears and decisions are made to make this ship a unique experience for your future cruisers."
3.0	Sail Date: Apr 09, 2016 /	Beautiful ship. Aisles too narrow for number of people on board on the public decks. You need a reservation for everything but arenas for events too small to accommodate the #of people aboard. Will not book on these large ships again.
4.0	Sail Date: Apr 09, 2016 /	Had a great cruise with 3 other couples.  This was our second time on the Oasis of the Seas. Weather was fantastic the entire trip, Labadee was a lot of fun great cookout.  My time dining crew was excellent and food was good too.  Enjoyed all the onboard shows especially Adult Comedy and Elvis Headliner. Zip Line was fun especially for the wives. Our house keeper was super she was very attentive. Arriving and departing on the ship was well managed.  The groups biggest disappointment 150 Park Central restaurant will not do that again.
4.0	Sail Date: Apr 09, 2016 /	"We had a wonderful trip. My husband and I had taken one cruise previously, along with our two oldest children (then 3 and 5). It was on another cruise line. Everyone talked up the cruise. It was such a disappointment. Nothing to do, one small pool. Needless to say, I didn't have high expectations this time. The less you expect, the less disappointment. I was wrong. I absolutely loved it. A great combination of relaxation and fun. Royal Caribbean does it well! I didn't pay attention when booking that we were on the biggest ship. It was amazing! It's huge! But somehow, doesn't seem overly crowded. 

There were a few things I would have changed, of course. We didn't get in to see the comedy show any of the nights bc it was always booked up. And after a few nights, we skipped the dining room. There are enough other options, and actually we preferred that. There is enough going on at night such as game shows, and things, that we were entertained. I did not want to leave this ship. I've been home 5 days and I'm having withdrawals!!! We didn't take our children, although there are tons of things for children on the ship, without feeling like you are surrounded by kids. All in all, I would, or shall I say WILL definitely do again!!"
4.0	Sail Date: Apr 09, 2016 /	"The size of the ship gives it a better ride.  During an overnight storm, I was not awakened.

MANY pools and hot tubs.  We are talking a lot.

Lot's of choices on eating.

A little extra entertainment.

Comedy club too small."
4.0	Sail Date: Apr 09, 2016 /	It was smooth sailing on the Oasis of the Seas. Great entertainments and shows on the ship. If you love Elvis, then you'll love Travis Ledoyt (Headliner). Dinning services was great. Hats off to severs Vishal and Jazzmin in the main dinning room. Love the layout on the ship.
5.0	Sail Date: Apr 09, 2016 /	Everything was great about this cruise, from the time we got to the port from the airport and through the line to getting our sail passes to get on the boat. Our room was ready around 1 pm so for about 40 minutes we just walked around the ship to get ourselves familiar with the Oasis of the Seas. I have cruised with Royal Caribbean numerous times but this was the first time being on the Oasis which was so much bigger than the other ships. We really enjoyed our Ports of call and met a lot of new friends during the week. Would definitely recommend this cruise to anyone.
3.0	Sail Date: Apr 09, 2016 /	I am very disappointed with the fact reservations are needed for most of the entertainment, for instance Comedy Show and Shows.  Also Ice Skating is on a first come basis.  So I wasn't able to experience the Comedy Show nor Ice Skating because they were filled to capacity.  Overall it is a beautiful ship but I will continue to cruise on Royal Caribbean smaller ships where I don't have to make a reservation and missed out on the fun.
5.0	Sail Date: Apr 02, 2016 /	"Just finished a 7 day cruise on the Oasis and I cannot find enough words to express my satisfaction with the cruise. From the time we boarded the ship to the time that we left it was truly a great experience. To be a ship of this magnitude my family and I never felt that it was overcrowded with guests or had to stand in any long lines. There were enough food options and entertainment choices that you will never feel bored or at a loss of appetite.

 

I cant wait until the next cruise on the Oasis!"
4.0	Sail Date: Apr 02, 2016 /	Captain great, weather wonderful shows good, food average, smoke on balcony bad, on and off excellent, staff very good, take lots of money - extras high.
5.0	Sail Date: Apr 02, 2016 /	The Oasis is awesome!!  It was so big you didn't even realize you were on a ship.  There were so many things to do you couldn't do it all.  We never got bored.  The staff was great too.  I was amazed that they could keep the ship so clean.  You never saw any trash or even a speck of paper.  I recommend this ship to everyone!
4.0	Sail Date: Apr 02, 2016 /	We love the shows....especially the aqua shows which you don't get on other cruise lines. We have a 6 year old so it's important that she enjoys the entertainment as well.  She also loved the ice skating show.  The food was excellent as the last time (2 years ago).  The staff is always friendly and helpful.  Don't be afraid about being on such a big boat...you'll figure things out after a day.  Room selection....we loved our location.  We were on forward part of the ship, 7th floor.  It was convenient to the fitness center and spa (6th floor), the boardwalk (5th floor) and Central Park (we ate breakfast at the Park Café - no extra charge).  Straight up to the 14th floor was the kids club.  BTW...if you have kids and keep to their bedtime schedule, you don't want a boardwalk or central park balcony (too loud).  My only complaint .....the fabric on our couch was dingy and dirty looking.  I'm afraid the boat is starting to show some wear after 8 years.
2.0	Sail Date: Apr 02, 2016 /	The ship was beautiful but I was guaranteed a ocean view room and I received an interior room. It had a balcony but it didn't take the place of an ocean view. Boat was sold out so they couldn't change it very disappointed.
5.0	Sail Date: Apr 02, 2016 /	This is the 2nd time on this ship and it was as good as the first. The crew was great, food was good, and we had a great time. The only thing that did not go well photo center, stay away from it. I would do this again!
4.0	Sail Date: Mar 26, 2016 /	I had a great time on the boat. This was a my 30th cruise, my  agent knew but that wasnt conveyed to the shipline. I had to fix the issue of the booking my guest in two separate dinner rooms. Therefore i will book directly through the cruise line and not a third party.
4.0	Sail Date: Mar 26, 2016 /	"The ship and the crew were fantastic! Dining area food was very good. The breakfast ""cafeteria style"" food was lacking. Powdered eggs were terrible. Not many ""green"" choices. Facilities were excellent. Gym was first rate. Labadee was a nice stop. Clean with nice activities. The wall/fence around the compound makes me think the outside is pretty rough. Jamaica was nice as well. Not too well organized but the people were friendly and patient. Cozumel is always nice. Departing the ship was delayed due to a lack of customs agents. Not RC's fault. Overall, I rate this cruise as ""Very Good"""
5.0	Sail Date: Mar 26, 2016 /	"We enjoyed the amenities offered by the ship. The shows were excellent, specially the ""Cats"" performance. The garden in the ship is very unique, quite unlike the other ships we have cruised on. Also enjoyed the great variety of restaurants and bars."
5.0	Sail Date: Mar 26, 2016 /	Although this ship is big and you can experience lines with all the people my grandkids had a great time ages 9 and 11.  They spent hours in the kids pool zone and the older one was big enough to participate on the flow rider.  We have been on this ship twice and this time we brought the grandkids and their parents.  There is a wide variety of excursions at the ports for all ages. RCCl's private island experience Labadee is outstanding.  We opted for main dining at a set time and I recommend that with kids and not my time dining if you want a formal sit down time for dinner. We had a great family vacation on this ship
5.0	Sail Date: Mar 26, 2016 /	I can't say enough about this cruise ship, and staff...it's way beyond my expectations!!...beautiful ship and whole staff is very pleasant, from the waiters to the room attendants...never a boring moment...In fact I already booked another cruise on this ship for next year
4.0	Sail Date: Mar 17, 2016 /	"Food wasn't the good enough, but the staffs were very kind to help, labadee island needs more improved because there is no restaurant there, and the buffet at labadee  was horrible. Porto Rico ok, ST Thomas is beautiful  the driver was very nice. St Kitts is wonderful place,I enjoyed the beach.

Oh wow i,love ST MAARTEN is a  beautiful place, I love the tour, the driver was very educated, I am in love with the parts of this island.

I will definitely recommend a family or friends to try royal Caribbean cruise."
5.0	Sail Date: Mar 17, 2016 /	"We had a great time on this cruise ship! It was an easy boarding process, it only took about 30 mins to board. The service was great and the food in the main restaurant was great! The buffet was good but I always would go to the main restaurant to eat, they have a better buffet in there! The kids area is to be avoided. My kids hated it there. They stated the staff was mean when the parents would leave. On the down side the prices for the restaurants were different then stated online. I called and I was promised $20 refund for a meal that was over paid but once I got on the boat they claimed that was not the case. The special restaurants state there is children price but there really is not. Our room was small with little storage space. The dress code for the restaurants were not in forced at all. On formal night people still were wearing shorts and T-shirts. 

All the stops were great and our shore trips were very nice. All the shows were great except for cats, way too long! Just make sure you get your tickets before you board and then check again when you are on board because they will change the time of your shows that you picked. 

In the end it took us about 1 hour to get off the boat. Great cruise line overall I would use them again."
4.0	Sail Date: Mar 17, 2016 /	"The ship offers so much for all ages.  We were 3 generations together on this ship for the second time.  Staff was outstanding.  Food was very good. Entertainment was excellent.  Our waitstaff (Aris and Avaylo) could not have been nicer or more accommodating, and our room steward (Anthony) and the others nearby were excellent.  We enjoyed lunches in Central Park and snacks in the Cafe with no added charges.  

     We would suggest a few small changes:  

       1.  The price for a small or larger bottle of water was excessive

       2.  Same rolls and no bread in dining room every night and in the

            Windgammer.

       3.  Teen center was not particularly well run.  (lacked communication)

       4.  Staff could not be reached for info regarding the Teen Skating for the

            hour preceding the event, even by guest services.

       5.  Popcorn on deck should be free and not $2.50 +18% (petty)"
5.0	Sail Date: Mar 17, 2016 /	"Good to get away for self time with spouse!!!!! With this 9 day cruise, 4 of the days were at sea. Two days leaving Ft. Lauderdale until we arrived at the first Port. Leaving one port (total of 5 ports) after another until we left St. Kitts. Two days at sea back to Ft. Lauderdale. You had a cruise compass for each day from day 1 to day 9 with daily featured events and most of the events were not for couples; therefore, we had to make our own fun daily. Overall it was a nice cruise with this being Royal Caribbean first 9 day cruise. Five Ports and four days at sea!!! I rated this cruise excellent because my spouse wanted to experience the Oasis of the Seas cruise ship. Now that we had this experience we may go back to the Freedom of the Sea!!!!

THANKS and ENJOY Oasis of the Seas with Family."
3.0	Sail Date: Mar 17, 2016 /	"RC Oasis of the seas stops at their private island in Haiti which is not one of my favorite ports. On their island you must pay for almost everything you do on the island, except the buffet lunch, heat, sweat and sunburn are free of course! If you go to the craft area you feel like you are in old Tijuana as the vendors are pushy, and won't leave you alone. ""How much DO you want to pay for this... I'll write your name on it"""
5.0	Sail Date: Mar 17, 2016 /	"This was a wonderful cruise.  The Oasis is a beautiful ship and all the staff were pleasant and friendly.  The meals were good and there is so much on the ship to do.  I encourage everyone to take a cruise.  It's a lifetime memory.  There is nothing you would not enjoy about cruising on the water.  It is so relaxing and so much fun.

 

Cheryl Burley"
5.0	Sail Date: Mar 17, 2016 /	It was a great experience .The ship is a state of art. We never got so much exercise on a cruise than on the Oasis of the seas.  You have to see it  to believe it. God willing we will do it again with our grandchildren.
4.0	Sail Date: Mar 05, 2016 /	Oasis of the Seas is a great ship with a lot of amenities.  Enjoyed the speciality restaurants and neighborhoods.  Great service as well and good choices for entertainment.  Definitely recommend this ship.
5.0	Sail Date: Mar 05, 2016 /	This cruise was incredible and exceeded our expectations!!! We definitely recommend this ship and can't wait to cruise again!! Royal Caribbean has done a great job!!
4.0	Sail Date: Mar 05, 2016 /	"Enjoyed our cruise. We met the captain several times and he was very friendly and personable. Loved Nassau & St Maarten. St Thomas was all about shopping, especially jewelry. So if you want to shop, you are set.

We wanted to go fishing at one of our ports of call but the St Thomas excursion was cancelled on us. 

We rented quads on St Maarten and drove around the island. Really enjoyed that but we did it on our own.

Some of the specialty restaurants were not what we expected.

Did win another cruise in the slot tournament so that was great."
4.0	Sail Date: Feb 27, 2016 /	beautiful ship, lovely facilities, wonderful entertainment.Did not visit speciality dinning but, food in main dining room good, service excellent, park cafe good, windjammer and solarium dining mediocre. Was shocked to pay $11.00 for a half glass of wine.  Bar prices too high!
5.0	Sail Date: Feb 27, 2016 /	"Loved everything about this ship.  Even though it's the largest ship in the world, you never go the feeling that it was overcrowded.  Had dinner at Chops Steakhouse and it was 5 star quality food and service.  Had dinner at Giovanni's and although it was great, Chops was better.  Did a wine tasting and had Tapas at Vintages and that was a great time.  Dinner and lunch in the dining room was good. They have a great salad bar at lunch in the dining room that I totally recommend - very fresh food.  Plenty of activities - bingo, trivia, zumba classes are some that I participated in and had a great time.  Only negative I can think of is sometimes the staff tried to be too friendly (yeah, that's a problem). The dining room staff would stand around talking to us for 5 to 10 minutes, when we just wanted enjoy our dinner or lunch.  I know some people like that....so not a big deal. LOVED central park!  Who wouldn't!  It's beautiful!  the entire ship is nice.  We stayed in a junior suite - I didn't like that we weren't considered ""suite"" guests with a gold key (that pushed you in front of lines).  If they call it a suite and you pay for a suite, it's a little annoying not to be considered 'suite guest"".  But that, again, wasn't a big deal, just a little annoying"
3.0	Sail Date: Feb 27, 2016 /	"The Oasis of the Seas is a Majestic Ship, absolutely worth seeing. However Royal Caribbean has lost touch with the Guests that pay the way.. We booked to celebrate My very Special Leap Year 60th Birthday.  booking agent knew this.. Royal Caribbean appeared to have no knowledge of it.. We met with the Captain & Crew, we mentioned where we were from and why we were on board.. was asked Our Cabin Number, one of his officers in charge of events said nothing planned for Leap Year Day and would bring that up at the meeting in the morning, Hubby asked where he needed to go ask to buy a b day cake for Me, she told him no worries whats Your Cabin Number, Your looking at who You need to see and we will take care of everything for You.. Cake, Decorations. etc.. she told Us I was the only guest Birthday for Leap Year. This officer was the only Female on the stairway at the Aqua Theatre she was introduced by the Captain as being from Canada. We Went to supper Sunday night at 5:30 was shifted to another dining room after and hours & half wait in line.. We asked the Maitre D how they would find Me for My Celebration tomorrow night, He took the Cabin Number and said don't worry we will take care of it.. Next night supper , Hubby asks at reception to the dining room is everything set up for My wife's b day, he said whats Your cabin number then checked and said nothing in the system regarding that. So we ordered and ate supper was offered the dessert menu we declined saying just the birthday cake would suffice and Hubby said he would share My cake with Me, after a very long wait three waiters come out and present Me with a 1/2 inch high x 2 inch long x 1 inch wide of their menu chocolate sensation square with a candle in it.. it was horrid same taste as a teaspoon of raw cocoa out of the tin.. 

10 Years ago We booked on the Royal Caribbean Mariner of the Seas and the exact same issues only this time after being forgotten it was a small slice of banana cream pie with a candle.. Sad Sad Birthday Celebration and yet others were receiving B Day Cakes, Wine, Fruit Baskets & Treats, it was reported to the front desk and We removed the Automatic Tipping from Our Account (which can be done by the way) We chose to tip those that served us well.. Royal Caribbean has gotten so big they don't give a damn about the Guests unlike other lines, been on 7 Cruises last time on Royal for sure.."
1.0	Sail Date: Feb 27, 2016 /	"Mikahl in Chops was terrible; the couple next to us ordered appetizers, then said they were still deliberating on entrees, and he told them that they had to order NOW, and that the menus were needed.


Ontay in American Icon was terrible. The table wasn't set when we were seated (at 8:35), he didn't greet us or introduce himself, or explain the night's selections, he brought my wife's soup and appetizer AT THE SAME TIME, he didn't clear our entrée plates before handing us the dessert menu, he didn't pour the cream into the soufflé, he brought my wife's coffee in a BREAKFAST mug instead of a cup and saucer, and the waiters were putting breakfast jelly on the surrounding tables at 9:45, when people were still eating! 


The Hostess at Chops was gruff and unwelcoming.

 

The show times were scrambled or cancelled with no explanation, my reservations weren't shown on my TV, room service couldn't be ordered from the TV, the art auction listed on time on their flyer and a different time in the Compass, we received another art auction invitation wit NO date listed (?), three of the fine dining restaurants were closed at various times for private functions. My 3-night dining plan said that the first reservation would automatically be scheduled the first or second night, but it wasn't."
4.0	Sail Date: Feb 27, 2016 /	I especially enjoy the opportunity to be able to have the different dinner venues that are on this ship. We had a balcony room over Central Park. This was not particularly to our liking and the room a bit too small. Going into the main dining room was a bit hectic with the amount of people. The shows were great! We enjoyed the Diamond lounge for our before dinner cocktails. Enjoyed my Latin music and dancing at the Boleros lounge. The sales on board were the same as usual. Wish they would bring new things. The shops are pricey. But, all in all, a beautiful ship and nice cruise.
5.0	Sail Date: Feb 27, 2016 /	We had a wonderful time!  I never felt like I was 1 of 6000.  Good entertainment, good food, excellent service!  The staff wanted us to have a great vacation and did everything they could to accommodate us.  We will be back.
2.0	Sail Date: Feb 27, 2016 /	On arriving to the room I tried to make reservations for shows and dinner and everything was already full. I did not realize that you need to make reservations prior to the cruise. I have been on other cruises and never had this issue.
4.0	Sail Date: Feb 27, 2016 /	Overall a pretty good experience. A little bummed about our cabin. I also tried to figure out why my husband is a gold member and I am not even though we have cruised identical together. I went to guest services about this and they didn't seem to have an answer or where to send me for the answer.....not good.
5.0	Sail Date: Feb 27, 2016 /	we love royal and especially oasis.  this is our second cruise on the oasis.  everything is top of the line.  we have tried other cruise lines but now only cruise on royal.
5.0	Sail Date: Feb 20, 2016 /	"First time on a cruise and I could not have made a better choice!  Crew was great, food was excellent, ship was awesome!!!  The port of calls were nice but the biggest treat was defiantly the ship its self.  So much to do and so much to see.  I know there are a couple of areas that I didn't have a chance to make it to.  Wish I had spent more time in the ""Central Park"" area.  Didn't discover that until the final night but it is very relaxing and a joy to spend time in."
4.0	Sail Date: Feb 20, 2016 /	"i am an Emerald Crown

 and Anchor member and I know what my time dining is suppose to be. This cruise was a complete disaster in My Time Dining. Long lines, ate on different floors everytime, and the service was horrible!!!! We ended up eating AT Windjammer of all things 4 nights because of it! Royal Caribbean you need to look at this as this is a problem"
5.0	Sail Date: Feb 13, 2016 /	"From the moment we got to the port, everything was smooth sailing on The Oasis of the Seas! Every single person was kind and efficient! We entered the ship to great fan fair! Music and good times greeted us! Smiling faces that aimed to please! And for seven days that's what we got! The shows were amazing! I had never seen such talent in one place!  The Dreamworks characters were there for the sailaway party and then they had the Aqua show which was amazing! Synchronized swimming, the breathtaking athleticism of olympic class divers and the heart pounding drama of acrobatic performances! One the second day we enjoyed the full production of the Broadway musical ""cats"". Just like the show you see in New York! The next amazing show was Frozen in time ice show! Hans Christian Anderson came to life in this breathtaking Ice Show! Featuring classic fairy tales such as ""The Snow Queen"" ""The Ugly Duckling"" and ""The little Mermaid"" And last but not least a gentlemen that was an artist drawing in sand! Unbelievable! Next the show ""Come Fly with me"" Daring aerial artistry, dance sequences and vocal performances! And again I said over and over, amazing! Then we were ""Blessed"" to see the Headliner show ""The Alley Cats""  A group of four men who could do anything! They were funny and were a great a cappella group singing 50's and 60's songs! Made you smile and cry at the great memories it brought to your mind. Their was so much more to do then just this, and I can't forget how amazing they all were. On to the food, What can I say but again, Amazing! It didn't matter which restaurant it was, every meal, every appetizer, every dessert was delicious! Dining rooms, waiters, the service, couldn't be any better! Even Johnny Rockett's was one of our favorite breakfast meeting places! All american food that made you want to come back again and again! The Spa was also unbelievable! I went in feeling like a mess and came out like I owned the world! To top all this off my husband put me in a slot tournament unexpectedly and I came home with a free cruise for December 4th,2016. Eligible to win a purse of $100,000 in a final tournament! It doesn't get any better than that! We feel so ""Blessed"" to have gone on an amazing journey and adventure with this wonderful Cruise line Royal Caribbean on ""The Oasis of the Seas"" Thank you! Thank you! Thank you! xoxo"
4.0	Sail Date: Feb 13, 2016 /	"This ship was designed to overwhelm and impress. The experience accomplishes both.  So many impressive features - too many to list.  I enjoyed the cruise but now I have ""been there and done that.""  Our next cruise will be on a smaller ship."
5.0	Sail Date: Feb 13, 2016 /	It was our excellent cruise overall. Wonderful crew members who make your time so memorable that you don't feel like returning. Something that the management can look into - the pictures taken in the cruise were very expensive to by. It would be worth to sell volume than the sky high profit. The pics would be wasted if people don't by due to the prices. I would like to go for cruises again and again with Royal Caribbean.
4.0	Sail Date: Feb 13, 2016 /	Overall the cruise was fine. There was the problem of being on a big ship, some of the lines for shows and meal were long, but not too bad. My main complaint was the gym, small and cramped for the size of the ship, the cruise line seemed to spend most of the space on the part of the spa that people had to pay for, and the gym, which was free, got short-shafted.
5.0	Sail Date: Feb 13, 2016 /	It was a great trip, the ship was excellent the food was good, we all had a great vacation. Lots of shops on board to buy things. staff was really nice to everybody.It took some time to find every thing because the ship is so big.
3.0	Sail Date: Feb 06, 2016 /	The food on the Oasis was mediocre. The buffet was the same everyday for breakfast and lunch. The food in the dining room was also mediocre. The room accommodations were a disappointment. I expected that they would be spacious staterooms with larger bathrooms and both were typical of any other cruise. The shower was an extremely small tube shaped stall. The storage space was rather chaotic. The bars and venues had their volume set very high and often ears had to be plugged do to the high volume. On the good side, the staff was exceptional!  Our dining room waiter was tops!!  Also, our room attendant was exceptional.
4.0	Sail Date: Feb 06, 2016 /	The ship was ginormous! We did everything from flow rider to going to the Shows on the ship. Every night was a different itinerary (ice show/ Cats/ theater). All the staff was fantastic and very informative! Food was good and satisfied me and I'm a picky eater.
5.0	Sail Date: Feb 06, 2016 /	As rated I had a wonder time on the Oasis celebrating my 62nd birthday on Super Bowl Sunday.  The staff, food and all activities were great. I was able to get my favorite cabin 12317 over looking the Boardwalk. I look forward to spending time on my next RC cruise.
4.0	Sail Date: Feb 06, 2016 /	"My over all experience was VERY GOOD. That being said, I had a few issues with our cruise. First off, the port of call in Nassau, Bahamas was a waste. Nassau is not a nice place. The walk to the city is a long way. Then you get barraged with taxi driver and another hounding the hell out of you. Then you get beggar after beggar, and savory person after another trying to sell you something or get you to go into a store. It's not good and we felt very uncomfortable with that experience. For an extra excursion fee, you can bus to the Atlantic Resort, but it was a rainy and windy day. I do not understand why they can not find another port of call? I have been to others on other cruise lines. Ports of call in St Thomas and St Maarten are excellent! Wish they would find another good port of call to replace Nassau and maybe one more stop at a private island would have been nice like Princess Cruiseline does.

 

There are several dining options on the ship, but a few you have to pay extra for; which I have no problem with. We ate at Chops Grill and Izumi, both were fantastic! However, DO NOT waste your time and money on Giovanni's Table. The food was bad and there was nothing Italian about the menu except it was written in Italian! It was pretty much just regular food you get at the other dining places. An Italian restaurant with NO Italian employees, no spaghetti, no meatballs, no pizza, no chicken parmesan, no lasagna, nothing Italian at all! When I asked our waitress about those items, she had never even heard of them! Like I said, just regular food with an Italian name! Even the staff seemed frustrated with the menu! Bottom line: They need to redo the menu! It is a pretty setting and nice atmosphere.

 

Entertainment onboard is good, but the Headline Act Show was a little boring and the show called FLY WITH ME needs some better tunes. One of the best shows of the trip was the DISCO INFERNO dance on Deck 5. Awesome time! Also, one more thing, $3.00 for a little tiny thing of popcorn in the Opal Theater? Really? $3.00?

 

Will I cruise again with Royal Caribbean? Of course! Just wish they would change a few things."
5.0	Sail Date: Feb 06, 2016 /	"This is the second time we have cruised on this ship; the first was a Western Caribbean cruise 2 years ago.  We loved this ship and it's offerings so much that we wanted to cruise on it again - albeit with a different itinerary.  Here's our detailed experience:

1.  Cabin Steward (Babu):  Great young man with an attitude like no other.  He was happy to help us, answered our questions, pointed us in the right direction several times (ok, it's a really BIG SHIP!!  ;-) ), and had our suite made up every time we left without our knowing he had been there.  We loved Babu!

2.  Food: There is a LOT of food on this ship. Except for one restaurant, the food was exceptional!  I would say the food experiences went in this order, best experience first:  A. 150 Restaurant in Central Park.  Absolutely first class in every single way.  Our Waitress / Host was a lovely woman from Trinidad, who was so sweet and fun... and made sure to carry our wine pairing ""opinions"" back to the chef, because he kept asking her for them!  The courses were so exquisite... B.  The Windjammer Restaurant/Buffet.  We ate most of our meals here, and the food was far above the quality you would expect from a buffet-type restaurant.  It's second place in my book, because of the consistently excellent quality of both food and service, day after day.  C.  Chop House in Central Park.  Another excellent restaurant.  We had a very good experience here, but it simply didn't compare to 150.  The wait staff was very good.  The food was great.  Desserts were awesome.   C.  Solarium Bistro.  The food here is always incredible, as is the wait staff. You can't beat the view, especially, and when we wanted a light-hearted meal out, this was the restaurant.  I would actually pick this over the Chop House now that I think about it, but I have all this written already...   D. Honorable Mention:  Coastal Kitchen (a Suites-only restaurant).  You would think that when serving suite-only guests, they would have this restaurant at the top of every single priority list.  Yeah... not so much.  As of our departure on 2/13/16, i would tell you to not bother with this one.  The service was absolutely terrible.  25 minutes for a mediterranean flatbread? 21 minutes for drink refills?  Unacceptable in my opinion.  Just not worth the bother of riding the elevator to the 17th floor, unless you want to sit at the bar and watch the sun set.  E. Also for honorable mention:  Johnny Rockets on the Boardwalk.  The wait staff was ok.  The food was heavy and greasy, and it ended up being the only meal we at that day.  Yuk.  Not going back there at all.  Actually we didn't finish our meal there because it was so heavy and greasy.  The malts, however were first class i must say.  F.  Room Service:  Unless you are ordering coffee, fruit trays or juice, DO NOT BOTHER! The room service food was simply and without exaggeration the worst room service food I have ever not eaten!  Gelatinous scrambled eggs.  Toast (I kid you not) I could not bite!  Nasty all around. 

3.  Shopping:  You can shop on board and off board on this cruise.  A word to the wise:  if you are shopping off board at any port, make sure to attend the shopping presentations on the Promenade deck prior to departure (usually the day before).  They have really good information for you, which will keep you from being hood winked and ripped off!  Lots of fun shopping in the ports though!  Also, the gift shops on board had nice things for the kids and grandkids, etc.

4.  Relaxation:  This is the place to relax!  On our balcony... On Deck... at Starbucks on the Promenade deck... Along the walking track at the back of the ship... there were places all over you could relax and kick back and watch the days, weather and water go by.  we had 3 sea days on this trip, which provided us a LOT of time to rejuvenate ourselves.

5.  The Vitality Spa and Gym:  First Class gym... awesome equipment, superb spa personnel, super huge running track on deck 5... ti's all there.  This ship is huge, as I have already said.. and 2.4 laps on the running track is a mile.  It used to be 4 laps around the track in high school was a mile.. so this gives you an idea how big this place is!  While on board, i wanted to spend a little uninterrupted time with a Personal Trainer, since work doesn't allow me that much disconnect from life to do personal training one-on-one, so I scheduled some time with a former Professional Athlete from Romania, Robert Mihai.  Fantastic guy.  Fantastic athlete.  Compassionate, conversational, and an incredible teacher when personal training. I wish he was in my gym at home. I would hire him often!

I hope that helps give you an idea if you are going on this ship..."
4.0	Sail Date: Feb 06, 2016 /	Overall...Great. Check in was very fast and prompt. U R talkin over 6400 guest here...Great. all cruise staff very friendly and helpful, Stateroom staff was fantastic..Ship had everything and then some. Entertainment, second to none (this was my 13th cruise and this ship was the Best), activities did not stop. Ship had so many physical activities as well. Wall climbing, Zip line, Pools, Surfing, Boogy Boarding, ice skating, Mini Golf, Basket Ball court etc, kept ya constantly going. Aqua theater was awesome, and movies under the stars took ya back to Drive in movie days(nights)....Even though there was a glitch on our dining time, Staff took care of it the best they could (sorry, had to fit that in somewhere) Eateries everywhere, all day and most of the night. Dining experience was great, the menu always had something different. The staff that served us we we very very through. Shops, Everywhere and Great deals all the time. Even though ship is one of largest in the world, I never felt crowded. The elevators kept you moving from deck to deck without waiting long.Central Park, Boardwalk, Promanide Deck was just spectacular. Directions of ship posted by all elevators, clearly marked, I was never confused, . Excursions in St Thomas and St Maarten were long but never blaring. Both tour guides made excursions very interesting. Transportation was very comfortable and sights we seen we we breathtaking. Weather was Not that great in Nassau and while sailing other than last day. Disembark net was swift, one of the best I have experienced......Only issues I had was that there was no announcements on when we got to port and when to disembark. Cruise director (Drew) was rarely seen or heard. I know I am forgetting some things, However, My wife and I had a fantastic experience on the Oasis of the seas. We are booked on Oasis Next March.
4.0	Sail Date: Jan 30, 2016 /	"The Oasis of the Seas is a wonderful ship.  We have been on 16 cruises and this, thus far, is our favorite ship.

I was NOT NOT a fan of the stops though.  I told my husband when we got off the ship that my favorite port had been Ft. Lauderdale.

All the shows on the ship are outstanding!  CATS was not our favorite, but from what everyone else said, it was was well done.  We just didn't get the whole idea of CATS.  But that was just us.

The staff was absolutely perfect...we didn't have one complaint about them.  

I think one of the only things I didn't like was at around 3:30 p.m. each day, ALL the food places close down....so you best not want a snack around that time"
5.0	Sail Date: Jan 30, 2016 /	I was amazed at how quick it was to get over 6,000 people on board. They had excellent systems in place. It truly helps when you register online. Met a Wonderful couple from Oklahoma and we became friends from the start. Our dining servers Sagar & Pan Li were the Best. They knew what we liked and had it ready for us. Very helpful and personable. We actually looked forward to dinner in the main dining room to be able to visit with them and even did table tricks & puzzles. Our room attendant Arnal did a wonderful job as well. We had some good conversations with him. The Oasis is a very large and wonderful ship. Well kept, clean and sparkling. There is plenty to do. You actually need more than 7 days to be able to truly get to everything without going home tired! We had a fabulous time and look forward to booking another trip with our Grandsons.
5.0	Sail Date: Jan 23, 2016 /	This was our first cruise and the experience on the ship was great.  The food on the ship was excellent.  I can not say that I had a bad meal at breakfast, lunch or dinner.  Two of the three shows that we saw were great, Come Fly and Frozen.  The Oasis water show was a little strange.  It does not seen to be for younger children.  It was very easy to get around the ship.  The hot tubs and pools were nice.  There was a lot of activities to occupy our time.  I would definitely recommend Royal Caribbean's Oasis of the Seas.
3.0	Sail Date: Jan 16, 2016 /	been on 33 cruises 1st and last time on oasis we are pretty easy to please breakfast at buffet and main dining room cold waited so long I n dining room ate it any how 1st night wanted to go to comedy show told it was sold out for the entire cruise were told have to book them before you cruise  I run a business 5 days a week 12hrs a day don't have time to book before cruise that's the reason we cruise to relax and be entertained . if you have 8.30 dinner reservations there are no shows to go to everything is geared for 1st seating purser desk told me there were plenty of other things to do on the ship if I want to gamble we live 1mile from a casino if I want to walk around we will go to the mall in our opinion ship, carries to many passengers to accommodate everyone well for us its back to the mid size ships not as many things to do but at least your able to do them without reservations months ahead of time I have never written a review before but felt the need this time beware future oasis cruisers bigger is not always better
4.0	Sail Date: Jan 16, 2016 /	"I wished to experience the huge Oasis of the Seas.  Our luggage arrived with us very directly.  We went

to our room.  I t was lovely.  Our travel person sent us a bottle of wine! We had lunch.  It was in the evening when we discovered that almost everything we did had to have a reservation.  We were on the anytime dining. But one must still make a reservation...we settled this with an 8:30 time .

This was a bit late, but had to feed us all!  Now we are ok.  Returned to room to read .  Learned about booking show and such by computer TV.  

We explored for hours.  So much to see.  After days, we agreed that this would be great for our entire family.  There seemed  to be quite a number of our folks.   All in all this was exciting.  This would be great for several couples to have fun.

 

The quality of performances was excellent.   We viewed diving of olympic quality.  The production of

CATS, took the cake!  I saw this several times.  Would have paid dearly for this set and cast.

Having a balcony, was worth the extra price.  

 

 For us, this was too dazzling.  I also missed the more personal attention of the wait staff .   To bus our tables  only,   did not seem correct, but only because we have been use to this manner on other trips.

We could find  quiet places.  But all and all, we would not choose this huge ship.  

I am still glad we tried."
5.0	Sail Date: Jan 09, 2016 /	Royal Caribbean did an outstanding job making our cruise experience exceptional. We were concerned about everything being crowded with 5,000 passengers aboard, but the variety of eating and entertainment options was awesome.  The crew made us feel a part of the big, happy family.  The quality of the dining and entertainment venues was first rate.
4.0	Sail Date: Jan 09, 2016 /	"We had a lovely time on this beautiful ship. The solarium and Central park were our favorite areas to hang out. Never felt crowded except for the lines at dinner some nights. We especially liked the table and chairs on our balcony where we had our room service breakfast and gazed out at the ports.

The entertainment was a mixed bag. Tried 3 times to see the aquatic show and never did because of large sea swells. CATS show was well done but too long. The rest of the shows were great.

Be prepared to walk a lot! This ship is huge! Great for families. Something for everyone!"
4.0	Sail Date: Jan 09, 2016 /	"This was the biggest ship my husband and I ever ever cruised on.  However, for the most part, it was crowded.  The only reason we gave it four stars instead of five, is that you have to book the shows several months in advance and you cannot just enter without a reservation unless there is seating.  This was our biggest disappointment because we had to wait for the midnight showing for the comedy show even though a larger venue was available. 

 

The food was amazing.  Our server Jezette was the best and I highly recommend her.  The ship was very clean and the staff was very attentive.  However, do not let the valet take all of your luggage at the pier.  It can take several hours to be reunited with your luggage and this caused us some grief because we had been traveling all day and wanted to change. 

 

Lastly, beware of the up charges.  I recommend if you are not a big drinker to wait for the 10 drink package that comes out a couple days into the cruise."
2.0	Sail Date: Jan 09, 2016 /	It is unfortunate to layer a negative remark on top of an otherwise positive experience with the cruise itself but as a result of going through  site rather than Royal Caribbean directly, the experience was more frustrating than necessary. Online, I had declined the travel insurance twice before speaking with the agent on the phone who made me again refuse it twice more. After four times refusing the insurance, I received there more emails and three more phone calls urging me to reconsider and pay for the insurance. That is a total of nearly 10 times refusing something that I clearly did not want. I realize the profit margin is the greatest with the insurance but I cannot stand being harassed over and over and over and over again about something I did not want. The insurance was so paramount for the CruiseOnly group that I am not sure they cared if we really took a cruise or not. I will not use the service again but I will take another cruise with Royal Caribbean. I still expect at least two more calls and or emails urging me still to get insurance even though the trip has already concluded or maybe they will find something else to sell me.
2.0	Sail Date: Jan 09, 2016 /	We experienced a very unorganized and confusing travel agent with . We also experienced VERY BAD customer service on our Royal Caribbean cruise.

at 10:30 RCC decided to get everyone off

this caused confusion, chaos in lines with shoving and people cutting around others to move to front. Almost had fights. Took an hour to get through cruise terminal. I do no want to cruise Oasis class again unless RCC can guarantee this never happens again.

terrible last impression after otherwise good cruise."
4.0	Sail Date: Jan 09, 2016 /	"Plenty of activities and shows on the ship for the family to do. The shows were top notch entertainment! Staterooms were very nice. We were in 10721 and it had a wonderful view out the back of the ship, we could see the diving show and watch people go by on the boardwalk. It was nice that the shower had doors not a curtain! Bed was surprisingly comfortable - our Room Steward Clover made sure we had everything we needed and always greeted us with an amazing smile!! The food was average. Breakfast and lunch were hit or miss and inconsistent (I eat scrambled eggs almost daily and they seemed to taste different every day). Dinner was always excellent and the menu very creative yet also offered classic ""safe"" food options. Late night food was limited and the room service menu was almost laughable on the lack of options. Last but not least you would never know you are on a ship with 6,000+ other people - except of course when you try to use the elevator after dinner or a show :)"
5.0	Sail Date: Jan 09, 2016 /	The cruise was a great experience and the ship was great.  A ton of activities, The food was great, and we were well taken care of.  I was ther to relax, and I achieved that goal.

Will have to do it again."
4.0	Sail Date: Jan 02, 2016 /	"The ship was new and clean.  The food choices were lacking.  The pool deck did not have tables to sit and eat to take care of overcrowding in the Windjammer. For breakfast there would be a long line waiting for a table unless you were taking the food to your room.  No trays available for takeout. After the Windjammer closed there was no beverage options available outside. You would have to go down to deck 5 or 4.  Cafe on 4 always closed early.

The ice cream machines closed sometimes as early as 6 pm which was unusual and you would have to walk over to the boardwalk and pay for ice cream. The comedy venue was too small and always had a wait to get in without a reservation.  After waiting for 30 minutes, we were turned away."
3.0	Sail Date: Jan 02, 2016 /	"This was our first cruise and I was very worried about the nickel and diming that could happen. Well, my worst fears realized. The very first person we met was the porter unloading cars. First thing she did was ask for tip to take our bags 15 feet. That pretty much set the tone for the trip. Be aware that if you don't do the prepay gratuity, they will charge per day per person $12.95. Watch your receipts when getting drinks or dinner, sometimes they already have in gratuity and still leave a blank line in case you want to add more. A rough estimate of what we spent on tips (including excursion drivers, guides, etc.) $500 for two. The ship is very nice and spacious. Rooms were nice but shower was small. Food was ok for lunch and breakfast (about same as what you would get at local buffet), dinner was really good. Service was always nice. Didn't realize until the cruise was almost over that you could really order more then just one main course, even get two of the same thing ... appetizer or main course. The Mexican place in the boardwalk had the best chips and salsa. Would have liked to try the other restaurants but didn't want to pay the extra fees. The ports of call were very third world and not impressive or great. I have no desire to go back to any of them. Labadee was nice but we found the beach to be very rocky and hard to walk on. Beware of the local vendors. My friends wife found out the hard way .. if they put anything on you they expect you to buy it. If you don't they get very disgruntled. It was unpleasant experience. The internet worked great and I didn't have any real problems connecting (yes, I actually did spend some time working). I was surprised by ""Come fly with me"". For being on a cruise ship that was quite a production and the high divers have some big .... Music on the pool deck was loud at times, found ourselves shouting at each other to talk. Like the different pool areas and they were constantly being cleaned. Overall the ship was impressive and nice."
4.0	Sail Date: Jan 02, 2016 /	Had a great time, Balcony room good but tight with two teens. Have already booked next cruise on board, got killer deal, plus 500.00 onboard credit. I put the teens  in a separate room for next cruise. Our stateroom attendant went above and beyond to keep us comfortable and supplied. Oasis, let me say, HUGE, plenty to do, crew and entertainment was great. Food always available, along with 24/7 ice cream. It was smooth sailing, didn't even feel like the ship was moving. Shore excursions were fantastic, especially Tulum, Mexico. A special thanks to Ms Arnold of Cruises only, she set us up, management if you read this, promote her!! Five stars to all who were involved in making my family happy and content onboard the largest cruise ship on the water, OASIS of the SEA. Royal Caribbean has it going on. Thanks Rod
4.0	Sail Date: Jan 02, 2016 /	"This has been our 14 Cruise with Royal Caribbean . We have been on the Oasis and Allure before, so we knew what to expect. Central park and the Royal promenade are away our favorite places to be. We enjoy the production shows and of course the diving shows are fantastic.

We were a little disappointed with the quality of the Food in the main Dinning room.  If you are looking to wow you're tastebuds, you may want to spend more time in the specialty restaurants ."
4.0	Sail Date: Jan 02, 2016 /	Our family of five adults took the Oasis of the Seas. The ship was chosen as our destination.  There are so many things to do on the ship that we simply did not have time to squeeze all of the available activities into our cruise. We found the Oasis of Dreams diving show to be outstanding, the Frozen in Time show was entertaining and the Come Fly With Me acrobatic show was very good. We did not care for the Cats show and left at intermission. The food in the dining room was good, however, it pales in comparison to the specialty restaurants. We thoroughly enjoyed the Chops Grille, Giovanni's Table had great food, Sabor's appetizers were delightful but the best dinner choice was the Chef's Table with its wine pairings. All dining personnel were terrific. Two places in the ship where we spent quite a bit of time were the Solarium pool area for adults only and the Rising Tide bar which elevates and descends three decks. We enjoyed the day at Labadee and went to Chichen Itza while docked in Cozumel. The port stop in Falmouth, Jamaica was very disappointing. We did not have the time to ice skate, flow ride, zip line  or rock climb - that will have to be reserved for a return visit!
2.0	Sail Date: Jan 02, 2016 /	I did not find this cruise to be family affordable. The on-shore excursion prices were not family-friendly, price wise. The evening entertainment did not appeal to all ethnicities. The cost of photographs taken by RC photographers were unreasonable. The daily rate charged for gratuities regardless of quality of service rendered is not a fair policy.
2.0	Sail Date: Dec 26, 2015 /	Uninformed staff, musty smelly stateroom, sliding glass door had to be fixed very difficult to open and close, made loud noise, cancellation of various shows, not enough music during the day on pool deck, had a great time at the Jazz on 4 and your servers at Boleros were awful, my husband and I sat down on two different nights and not one of the servers came over to us to see if we needed a drink or anything, and its not like they did not see us, they made eye contact with and and just kept going around us like if we weren't even there. Upon our departure, I mentioned to the staff of their ignorance towards us and the excuse was they did not see us.  So on the next night, we sat again in the same section and again, we where there for more than an hour without getting service.  Very Very Unhappy, Next cruise we will try Allure again.  Really dissapointing over-all.
3.0	Sail Date: Dec 26, 2015 /	This was out first cruise on Royal Caribbean and our girls were excited to cruise on oasis of the seas. Although we had fantastic service from the speciality restaurants and our stateroom attendant, the dining room experience was the worst we have experienced on 15+ cruises we have taken. I would only return to this ship if I ate only at the speciality restaurants and avoided the dining room. We had reservations in the dining room and waited over 45 minutes to just check in.  At the same time those guest without reservations were seated before us. Lastly the food we were served was cold and poor quality. We asked to speak with that food and beverage manager while on board to share this poor experience with them but ey did not contact us.
4.0	Sail Date: Dec 26, 2015 /	"Could not have had a better family trip. Celebrated our 50th and our sons 49th. 

We were 11 and ages were from 12-80. There was always something for everyone to enjoy. The shows were great, casino fun, food good and service excellent. 

Run with extreme precision. 

Will consider RC again.

5.0	Sail Date: Dec 26, 2015 /	"I went on this Holiday cruise with my family. My wife, daughter, son, mom, two aunts, an uncle, my cousin, my brother and sister in-law, my niece and my nephew.

 

We had a great and very enjoyable time. For the most part everything was fantastic. If you are looking for areas of improvement I would suggest not butterflying the filet mignon when someone ask for it med-well. There were several people in our party at Chops Grille that order their steak that way and were disappointed in their dried out steak. I believe that butterfllying the steak to get it more evenly cooked probably dried it out but also took away from the presentation.

 

It would also be nice if you could accommodate parties larger than ten at Chop's.

My wife and I  ate at Giovani's, at Chef's Table and at Chop's previously on another cruise and really enjoyed Chop's the best. That's why we decide to treat our family on this cruise and felt like we would not go again with a big group.

 

Anyway, this was the only issue we had and I would not have even mention except for the fact that I needed to fill this box to be able to continue. Also, I hope this helps you to continue to become better at what you are doing.

 

Everything else on the cruise was fantastic. Vicky took really good care of us a Dazzles the few nights we were in there. Thanks Royal Caribbean Team for providing a great Holiday Vacation!"
3.0	Sail Date: Dec 26, 2015 /	Should really give a lower rating, since I got food poisoning at the Solarium on day 2.  The upside is, I lost some weight on a cruise rather than gaining.  Service staff was very good.  Getting on/off ship was quick and efficient.  Service staff and vacationing with terrific friends boosted the star rating. Best 'included' spot to eat is Central Park Cafe.  I never eat lunch at the dining room, but did on New Year's Day and that buffet was OUTSTANDING.  Sorry, Wipe Out Cafe food was gross.  Beds comfy and showers hot with good pressure--some important points for me when I travel.   All Aquatheater shows and performers get an A+++, because they are simply amazing to do that on a moving ship.  Major broadway show on board--Cats--was cancelled entire week, but this didn't make me sad (rarrrrrr).  Cruise director Ricky and staff were probably the worst I've seen.  I've seen a lot of the RCCL routines before and their performance of some of the shows and contests rates the lowest.  Sorry Ricky, Quest rated a C- and Love and Marriage game a total bore D-.  Casino Royale is one of my fav spots, but gets a B- based on my winnings.  RCCL, why do you have such a tiny comedy club on Oasis?  New Year's Eve on the Promenade spectacular, but could use more bartenders.  I've noticed that RCCL is making a lot of areas and things to do 'privileged' on the Oasis....  Special deck areas and lounges are reserved for the guests of the more expensive suites or Emerald or better members.  The on board credits were wrong and we wasted a lot of time in line trying to get things corrected.  Still waiting on the remainder of the credits.  Watch your paperwork/account balance closely if you are offered credits.   Only take a cruise if you can handle a lot of walking--up and down steps!  The elevators take forever.  This didn't bother me as I'm in pretty good shape, but should be noted for people who are not.  Overall any vacation for me is a good vacation, but I felt the need to be critical on the details here for the benefit of future vacationers.  Happy sailing..
2.0	Sail Date: Dec 19, 2015 /	"Was told one price for credit, but yet did not get the amount that was the incentive for booking.  Had to call numerous times to even get adjustments, as the initial booking agent did not document the credit amounts, and never have received the full amount. 

 

Next time will just book directly with the cruise lines."
3.0	Sail Date: Dec 19, 2015 /	"We enjoyed the cruise once we got settled.  The first dining experience was

difficult as we had requested a table for 14 and had it confirmed by Ms. Jena Keese when we booked the cruise on March 31, 2015.

 When we checked in with Royal Caribbean, they had assigned us to 3 different tables that were not even close together.  After checking with their maitre'd at the dinning room, they ended up giving us two tables for the first night and promised to find a

better seating arrangement from then on.  The second night, they moved us to one of the paid restaurants and gave us two tables.  The third night, they changed our seating to yet another one of the restaurants and again gave us two tables .  This ended up being the sitting arrangement for the rest of the trip.    This was our family Christmas celebration and dinner was the most important

meal of the day for us.  According to RC they had never

confirmed a seating arrangement for 14 in one table. This was very disappointing to all of us especially since I had booked this cruise early enough to prevent things like this to happen.  I would appreciate your looking into this because I would like to know whose fault it was that the seating arrangement

which was originally confirmed was not honored.  I thank you for your attention,

Valentina Putzeys"
5.0	Sail Date: Dec 19, 2015 /	This was the first cruise for many of us and you couldn't ask for more.  The ship is absolutely beautiful and many families were celebrating Christmas.  The shows were wonderful, and were enjoyed by all ages - 9 years old to 70.  The food was terrific and service was above and beyond.  Thank you to Marolotta for her help in scheduling this wonderful vacation.
5.0	Sail Date: Dec 19, 2015 /	"I chose a 7 day cruise on the Oasis as a family Christmas gift. We traveled with my parents, sister, husband and 3 adult children. This cruise did not disappoint!! The dining options were amazing! They had something for everyone and a vast variety of food selections to choose from, and everything was delicious! 

        The boarding and departing process was quick, easy and painless. We were actually off the boat and with our luggage before our printed time! 

          There was more than enough to do for everyone. The aqua shows were very nice and the Cats play was very well done! The staterooms were a nice size and out Attendant Gerry was phenomenal!! Everyone on staff was wonderful, kind and helpful. 

            To sum it up; We were treated like Royal family!! We will definitely recommend and cruise again with our Royal Caribbean Cruise Family!!! - Marinda"
3.0	Sail Date: Dec 19, 2015 /	Fun ship but too big for me , to many people . The stateroom furniture needed replacing . worse bad .no toilet seat cover for in public restroom .the food was good in the anytime dining and great services .
1.0	Sail Date: Dec 19, 2015 /	"very rude staff all thruo out the ship and also the have curfew on the teen under 18 they have to be in there room at midnight and not  allowed to be anywhere on the ship pass midnight 

mans the food so  yucky  

we will never sail with royal Caribbean anymore"
3.0	Sail Date: Dec 12, 2015 /	The staff were not very friendly. The photo studio could not find any of our pictures and told us to check our folders daily. We don't have any pictures from the cruise. We were a party of 8 in 5 cabins and not 1 picture could be located.
5.0	Sail Date: Dec 12, 2015 /	"This cruise has to be the most fun I've ever experienced in comparison to any other cruise I've been on.

 

On this particular ship, I found there was so much to do!   We literally weren't able to see all the venues during our trip - which is a good thing, because we are going back in May!

 

The ship was extremely clean, the accommodations were great (we had a balcony overlooking Central Park - room 14-193) and the food was impressive for a cruise ship. (We were on the Queen Mary 2 and felt the food was comparable and at times, exceeded QM2)

 

The ports were a lot of fun (we've been there before) except that the Bahamas was a dump in my opinion.  When you get off the ship, go to Atlantis - you'll thank me later!!

 

One bit of advice for you:   If you rarely to hardly drink soda, DON'T buy the drink package.   I made that mistake.   I drink water and I could find cups of water anywhere on the ship, but I bought that refill Coke cup for a fee per day and it was a waste.  If you drink water, forgo ANY drink package.  (I also don't drink alcohol)

 

You must go on this trip!"
5.0	Sail Date: Dec 12, 2015 /	We celebrate our Anniversary every year cruising and Royal Caribbean is our favorite.  Embarkation in Ft. Lauderdale is one of the easiest to maneuver through and the staff are some of the friendliest. We have found waiting until later to get there makes it easier and quicker and there seem to be no lines. We have never been disappointed in the food whether it is in the Windjammer daily for lunch, ordering room service for Breakfast or a late night snack, or our evening meals in the Dining Room which always have several excellent choices to choose from.  Our only issue we had on this cruise when requesting a table for two for dining in the evening was the Head Maitre D on this cruise was not the friendliest or accommodating and was actually very rude.  We did receive one, but not without some issues and being bumped from it without warning on the final Elegant night without apology to be moved back to it the final evening.  Things we would highly recommend for cruising is taking advantage of ordering online on the Royal Caribbean sight things you may want to do or use.  We took advantage of ordering our internet package ahead of time and it was ready to use the minute we stepped onboard.  Another purchase ahead of time was the Alcohol package which was a huge savings and they have three to choose from, this also includes the Soda package and the upper two packages also include water as well.  Last, we highly recommend taking advantage of the Valet Luggage and Airline Check In.  Huge time saver at Disembarkation.  It has to be set up before Wednesday of the cruise.  The cruise staff takes your luggage the morning of Disembarkation to the Airport for you, checks it in at your airline so all you have to do is leave the ship, walk through the security checkpoint on the ship to your taxi and go straight to the airport and then through security there to your flight.  Huge, huge, huge time saver without the headache of finding your luggage the morning you leave and waiting in the lines at the cruise terminal.
4.0	Sail Date: Dec 12, 2015 /	Oasis is a beautiful ship.  Initially put in a corner facing the wall for dining at 6:00.  After 1st night, spoke with maître d who moved us to a lovely table on deck 4.  Our waiter and assistant at that table were wonderful.  All else very good.  It is a shame that shows do not rotate more often.  Same shows from a year ago.  Comedy show was really great as was the headline show, which was different from last year.  Cats, Come Fly with Me, Ice Show and Aerial show were the same from early Dec. 2014.
5.0	Sail Date: Dec 12, 2015 /	Absolutely GRAND! The Oasis of the Sea was filled with activities, the food wasn't the best, however we were please with Rachel services. EXCELLENT!  In our stateroom the couch had nasty spots on it, it was dirty, and look like someone had spilled something on the couch, simply put it was nasty.
3.0	Sail Date: Dec 12, 2015 /	We have cruised many times and on many different cruise lines. The ship is beyond explaination. It is awesome. The entertainment was the best we have seen on any cruise line. The food was average or  slightly below. The room service was great, the park cafe was good, the boardwalk dogs (Sicilian and brats) great, the main dining room lackluster and overly salted, the buffet was far below average. Waitstaff in main dining room were average. Room steward was great. If you for the ship it will not let you down. If you go for the food or service they are a let down in comparison.  Final helpful hint, bring pens! They ask you to fill out customs documents and baggage tags but they do not have pens for you to complete the task. And yes I am serious about that.
5.0	Sail Date: Dec 12, 2015 /	"This was our second time on the Oasis and the second time we enjoyed every minute of it.  The entertainment on board is absolutely amazing!  The food was not as good in the main dining room as we have experienced on Celebrity.  I think the Diamond level status should have better benefits.  The drink packages are good for most, but to me, very expensive.  I would rather have a discount pricing on drinks vs. all you can drink....way too many people over drink.

I was shocked we didn't do one more stop, 3 days at sea, especially 2 back to back was odd for us.  We are no longer sun worshipers, so it was basically just eat and walk around.  We are not a fan of Nassau, and especially when you are only there until 1pm....to do anything is too short."
3.0	Sail Date: Dec 12, 2015 /	"Winjammer buffet dishes are the same for the 7 days - nothing news daily.

Lunch buffet at main dinning room is much better than dinner at Grande or American Icon.

Glass of Oberon red wine is over charged $15 + tax + tips.

Tips is automatically added into every bill including minibar water bottle.

Bottle of water served in stateroom is expensive $2.50 per 8 oz bottle. 

$12.95 tips per person per day was added into bill automatically.

Ventriloquist is only show has a bit entertainment.  Oasis of Dreams cancelled twice due to windy and rainy show.  Come Fly with Me and Cats are childish fun.

 

We enjoyed the stateroom attendant, waiters/waitresses and servers, and staffs at American Icon and Grande.  My waiter, Ryan, went far and beyond to find me a good Indian food dinner on my last dinner on board.

 

Royal Caribbean Int't knows how to make money off from guests.  Last 8 oz bottle of water cost $9.50."
5.0	Sail Date: Dec 05, 2015 /	"I have been on 4 other cruises (not having been 21) and this one is by far the best that I have been on. The service was great.. Our room attendant was awsome, as well as the bartenders at the sand bar. (KT GENNER & RAPHAEL)

I would definitely recommend Royal Caribbean to other customers."
4.0	Sail Date: Dec 05, 2015 /	On the Oasis they give you so much to do you could stay busy all the time. Because she is so big, you hardly notice that there are thousands of other cruisers on board. The gym was great, the food was very good and they offer lots of choices on where to eat and when, the boat was clean and well cared for making our cruise experience top notch. One of the best things for us was hardly no one used the stairs so they were always empty. We never used an elevator even though there were 15 or so decks. We are looking forward to our next Royal Caribbean cruise.
3.0	Sail Date: Dec 05, 2015 /	"This ship was beautiful, but way too big for our liking.  With over 6000 people on board, it was too crowded to enjoy.  Central Park was our favorite area.  The food was very disappointing - it was cold and presentation was not there.  It seemed they just wanted to get the food out and be done.  My time dining was just herding cattle.  Service was good.  Rooms were smaller than on other ships, but still nice.

Entertainment was just OK.  Did snorkeling excursion in Cozumel but they simply took us to 2 areas off the shore - didn't get to see much.  They spent more time partying on the way back."
5.0	Sail Date: Dec 05, 2015 /	The Oasis is a floating city with professional entertainment as great as anything you'd see on Broadway.  Staff is friendly and helpful and take pleasure treating passengers like royalty.
4.0	Sail Date: Dec 05, 2015 /	Cruise ship is beautiful and most of the entertainment was excellent. CATS was not a big hit with 3/4 of crowd leaving at intermission. Food was great in the dining room as was the service. Food in the Windjammer was just ok. Staff on the ship in general need work on customer service. Would not purchase the thermal spa package again. Facilities are small - they do have a large nice locker room but have no keys for the lockers. Spa staff was the worst I've seen in my 25 cruises. Gym area is big and nice. Had no problems getting on a machine. Also seemed to be plenty of places on deck to get a chair at any time.
5.0	Sail Date: Dec 05, 2015 /	We had a really great cruise.  The entertainment was great, the food was really good, in fact better than expected.  The wait staff was superb.  Of course the ship itself is awesome, couldn't tell that there was 6000+ people aboard.  We did have some waiting at the anytime dining on a couple of nights, like lobster night, but that is expected.  The maître-de  staff even offered comps at a couple of the specialty restaurants instead of waiting in line, which we took advantage of, but a bit disappointed in the food at Solarium restaurant.  I even had an outdoor section to smoke my cigars.  We had no problems / delays in getting onboard, a little delay in disembarking... more of an issue with the port.
5.0	Sail Date: Dec 05, 2015 /	"The crew was very attentive. The food was great. the behind the scenes full access tour was very interesting and informative. Lots of great options every day. Peter the piano player at the schooner bar was super talented and very engaging.

The only down side was that our room was directly under one of the outboard spas, which was always open and every time it turned on  we could hear it and would wake us up if sleeping."
5.0	Sail Date: Nov 28, 2015 /	Stateroom attendant Garry Simeon and Waitress Althea and assistant waiter Ryan where very professional and performance of their required duties and responsibilities where above reproach. Gary, Althea and Ryan made our vacation every lasting with their happy and friendly attitude and services was excellent. I recommend all three of them to anyone sailing on the Royal Caribbean Oasis of the seas. We were in stateroom 9668 and dine at Silk table 928.
4.0	Sail Date: Nov 28, 2015 /	"The ship was beautiful.

DO NOT get my time dining.  We had to stand in line 30 min and we HAD reservations! 

The shows were nice. the sound system for CATS must have been messed up though because we could not understand the words, left about 20 min into the show.

The diving show was canceled, several times so we never got to see it.  First, about 5 minutes into the show they stopped it because the ship was moving too much and it was dangerous for the divers. Second, because of problems with the pool, so they canceled it.  then the last show of the week, the sound system would not work.  I think it would have been a great show if we could have seen it.

There is not enough time at the ports.  For example, the Bahamas port left at 2 PM so we had to be back on the ship at 1:30."
5.0	Sail Date: Nov 28, 2015 /	I really enjoy with this cruise.food was good especially windjammer market place.but dining food is less than average.my room was clean,and the shows was awesome.really recommended.
2.0	Sail Date: Nov 28, 2015 /	Took my parents on their first cruise for their 50th anniversary.  We had cruised before several times RCI with good experiences.  The ship is absolutely beautiful with lots to offer, but the overcrowding and over-stressed staff leads to poor customer service and an unfriendly experience.  The boat is handicap accessible but far from handicap friendly.  If you are in a wheelchair forget getting through the Promenade deck, which you must do to get anywhere.  Selling of goods, parades, Zumba, line dancing etc all take place here.  Every little thing that can be charged for extra is done.  Long lines for customer service.  Long lines for eating or any activities. Long lines for elevators that close on you before you are even completely in the elevator is the norm.  The buffet is a disaster with crowds and no tables.  The staff seemed stressed and spread thin and were unfriendly. Our last day at 7:15 a.m. someone walked in our room after a brief knock to count the mini bar before we were dressed.  On Prohibition Party night a staff member was more interested in how fast he could get everyone in and took it upon himself to press the button to make my mom's electric scooter go faster that he rammed her into the wall, catching her toes.  By the next morning they were severely black and blue and swollen. When reporting the incident it seemed to be more my mom's fault as to why she let him touch the button, as if she had give him permission, than concern over her injury.  The injury was severe enough for the ship doctor to order her to bed rest for the remaining 4 days of the cruise.  No apology was given, no offer of compensation other than a specialty restaurant dinner for someone ordered to stay in bed.  Very disappointing and felt the trip was stressful and a waste of money.  Keep in mind when booking that it does have a zip line, rock climbing, carousel etc, but these things are only open a few hours a day and you will wait in long lines to do any of them.  We felt the dinner food was good, our dinner service was good by Nicholas, and one specialty restaurant first night in Chops was fabulous.  However, the dinner for 5 did cost $268 dollars with tip, which would have bought  an extremely nice dinner for 5 most anywhere on mainland without going on a cruise.  We will try a different cruise line in the future.  It's a shame!
3.0	Sail Date: Nov 28, 2015 /	"I went on this cruise because I wanted to join a group having seminars on board, and their block of rooms was already booked.  Yours was the best offer and was the first time using CrusesOnly.  I was very satisfied with your service and recieved everything that I was promised.  I would use CrusesOnly again.

I didn't like having to book shows on Oasis at 10:45 pm.  Ship too big and like the Freedom of The Seas size much better."
4.0	Sail Date: Nov 28, 2015 /	There were 6200 passengers and 2500 crew members on the ship.  I thought they did a great job of moving people.  There were only a couple of times that we had to wait a long time for an elevator.  They highly promote their specialty restaurants but we didn't try any.  We just don't feel we need to spend more money on food when there is plenty of food already.  The food on the Oasis was better than the other Royal Caribbean ships we have been on.  The promenade was beautiful and made you feel like you were downtown in an old time city.  Make sure to prebook any shows you want to see.  Don't bother to see Cats, it was awful.  The actors and actresses were good but the story is not.  Most of the audience fell asleep in the first act.  The second act was better but we didn't understand what the show was all about until the last few minutes.  The Aqua show was fantastic!  They were only able to perform once as first the weather didn't cooperate and then there was bacteria in the water.  Finally the very last night they were able to perform.  Watching them dive from 85 feet high into a 14' pool was very exciting.  The synchronized swimmers, divers and tumblers were all excellent.  We feel that Royal Caribbean is the al-a-carte cruise line.  You have to pay extra for most of the activities on the ship.  The ship was beautiful and we enjoyed the cruise, but talking to other passengers that have cruised on Royal Caribbean, the consensus was that they enjoyed the smaller ships because they got more personalized attention.
5.0	Sail Date: Nov 21, 2015 /	Everything was excellent, the staff all were their to please us and did a great job. I would say the food was excellant and the entire trip was great. Would reccomend the Royal Line to anyone.
4.0	Sail Date: Nov 21, 2015 /	"Generally speaking, we enjoyed the cruise very much. Buffet in Deck 16 is very large and the food is ok, but it could be better, especially, it has an identical menu in all 7 days for each breakfast, lunch and dinner.

 

We enjoyed the dinner in restaurants in Deck 3, 4 and 5. The food quality and service was excellent."
3.0	Sail Date: Nov 21, 2015 /	My family and I were on the Oasis over Thanksgiving Had a great time Just a lot I mean a lot of people ( over 6,000) , it was like being in New York at Macys on black friday. Everything had an up charge, example $39.00 steak dinner, $6,99 for a hamburger at Johnny rockets ect,   and their were no perks in the casino no matter what you spent. Drinks were $10.00 for 1 oz pour and not one drop more 1oz. The ship was amazing and well worth the one and only one time experience. Personally my wife and I will go back to Holland America or Princess and if the grandkids are with us Carnival
4.0	Sail Date: Nov 21, 2015 /	"The ship was BEAUTIFUL !!!!!!!! And so well maintained. Shows were wonderful and food was delicious. I did my time dining for the first time and even though food was delicious I like 1st seating in Regular Dining room better. Loke having same wait staff and table every night, makes it more personal.

 

Decided we were going casual for Thanksgiving Dinner so did the WindJammer and IT WAS AWESOME...Turkey, stuffing, ham, Lamb, Mashed potatoes....anything that you could think of was there and so delicious !!!!!

 

My 16 yr old son loved the Flowrider, miniature golf and the ice cream and candy store on the boardwalk...wouldn't do the zip line. His favorite by far was being able to order FREE room service every night (but we always tipped person who brought our snacks) from the TV and he always ordered the Chocolate Chip cookies and milk !!!

 

The Park was soon beautiful, especially at night and so peaceful and loved the little Park Cafe they had there for Lunch. Grand Promadade was GREAT and loved the Christmas Decorations...Had so much fun watching the parade and the 70""s Disco night with the Oasis Men was great !!!!



Just had one complaint. I decided to rent a wheel chair due to my painful knees so my husband and son sould push me around the ship so I wouldn't have to deal with the pain. It was put in my profile that I would be bringing a wheelchair...booked throught a special promotion that you got an outside balcony room guaranteed but weren't able to pick your room. Royal Caribbean in thair infinite wisdom decided to put me (and my wheelchair) in the last cabin at the end of the hallway (10328) !!!! We did not mind being in the back of the ship or the cabin, cabin inself was great. What we did mind is every morning when we left cabin and most every evening all the cabin stewarts had their carts out and my wc and a cart just don't fit together side by side so I would try to walk around some of the carts and other would have to move their carts out of the way...really PIA for both me and the Cabin Stewarts. Not to mention my poor husband or son having to push me allllllll the way to the end of the hallway on brand new carpet so it was a little on the hard side to push me all the way down the hall. Did learn a lesson though...will never let them pick my cabin again no matter how good the deal is...it is just not worth it."
2.0	Sail Date: Nov 21, 2015 /	"Well, the cruise was about average except for the service...............I found it poor. Long lines exist for every single thing except for going on the ship and leaving the ship that was very efficient. The food was average. The so called professional photos were horrible and of poor quality. My room attendant was exceptional. We booked a ""Supreme/Superior Ocean view Balcony  Stateroom and received a regular balcony room and I complained to guest services and received no satisfaction at ALL. Therefore , I opted out of the gratuity..........they could have given us onboard credit for the difference in price of the room but THEY did NOT! The room should have had a love seat but had a nasty chair and they even brought another chair> which did not match. I have included a picture of this mess>they even put a sheet over the nasty chair to hide the DIRT...........I have been on several cruises before this venture on the biggest ship. I believe that they get a lot of customers like me>One timers> meaning I have checked it off and will not return to this Oasis ship. Bigger is NOT always BETTER. Everywhere we went we heard the same complaints from other

5.0	Sail Date: Nov 21, 2015 /	As a seasoned cruiser (15+) I can say that this ship, the Oasis, was a gorgeous ship. It had all the bells and whistles and definitely lived up to its reputation. I truly enjoyed the whole experience.
1.0	Sail Date: Nov 21, 2015 /	When I booked the cruise,  has d the promotion of receiving onboard credit. My reservation should be qualify for $150.  However, royal crabean didn't find 's notification. I didn't get the onboard credit.
3.0	Sail Date: Nov 21, 2015 /	"My husband and I set sail for a Thanksgiving cruise aboard Oasis. This was our 6th cruise and 2nd with RCI. My disappointment is mostly with how infrequently you see the ocean. This was the only cruise I've taken where I felt like I was in a mall rather than a ship. They do a lovely job and the service and room were excellent so I can't really fault RCI. My review has more to do with preferences.

I like the Freedom and Voyager class ships better due to layout. I was not happy with the movie screen being in the AquaTheater - it was rarely used by anyone. I also didn't like that on Oasis the jogging track is on deck 5 (I think) behind the life boats. I prefer it to be at the top of the ship where you can enjoy the ocean views. I am thankful we had a balcony so I had a view as well as a quiet place to read or have breakfast.  

 

I recommend Oasis only for active families with kids since this is not what I'd consider romantic for a couple. Again, due to preferences. Oasis is too large and doesn't feel enough like you're at sea to me so I will stick to the smaller ships or Disney Cruise Line."
2.0	Sail Date: Nov 14, 2015 /	"Although the ship was beautiful, it was a bit misleading. There are over 60 places to eat and you would think you could eat anywhere you chose to. WRONG! There were 30 ""SPEACIALTY"" restaurants, you had to pay to eat there. There were approximated 30 complimentary restaurants, but only 3 or 4 you could eat dinner at!    Very misleading, although the main dinning room, American Icon, Dazzle and Silk, a three level restaurant, touted as 3 different restaurants, NOT!!! Same menu, nothing special. Not sure what they are doing when it's supposed to be ALL INCLUSIVE; very misleading!!"
5.0	Sail Date: Nov 14, 2015 /	Oasis was truly a sensational vacation experience.  As always, Royal Caribbean was welcoming and professional.  Everything from start to finish  was perfect.  Great service at the pier as well as onboard.  We had a great time and were able to celebrate a special occasion in style.  Thanks to Cruise One for taking care of all the details.
5.0	Sail Date: Nov 14, 2015 /	Loved our time on the ship and on the islands.  Plenty to do and see.  We were pampered in all areas and the staff on the ship went beyond their obligation to make things perfect for our time aboard.  If we requested something it was there.  Amazing!
4.0	Sail Date: Nov 14, 2015 /	I felt we were just a boat Big boat and for that reason not a need to share what is going on ne sailaway parties which we enjoy. what was said was heard poorly bad system. As I took our complete family including grandkids there was lots to do for them. I felt bad for my daughter that need a pack and playfor their 11 month old did not give room for their 6 year old to pull out the bed. I thought this was to be a larger room as we did pay extra for that. What happenend?? liked to see some ice carvings and more fruit and vegetables carvings. why can things that look sweet not taste sweet.Not sure why I do this as I never get a response
4.0	Sail Date: Nov 14, 2015 /	This is a great ship and big I might add, They need to bring down their drink prices and picture prices,very high for the little they give you,the on Board credit will last not long.
1.0	Sail Date: Nov 14, 2015 /	overall the cruise was nice, however it was very bothersome to see a security guard sitting right outside at the door across the hall 24/7 for a day and a half. Lots of commotion, family visiting, good being brought to man inside etc. isn't there a more discreet place to put someone required in lockdown?? We had kids with us and it was very uncomfortable. This part of the cruise disgust our family having to walk out of our room to see all this
5.0	Sail Date: Nov 07, 2015 /	WE LOVE ROYAL CARIBBEAN BUT THIS YEAR HAD A LITTLE PROBLEM WITH AN INJURY DUE TO FOOT BEING HIT BY VERY HEAVY RESTROOM DOOR AS SOMEONE COMING OUT WHEN MY HUSBAND WAS GOING IN.   HAD TO GO TO MEDICAL EVERY DAY FOR CHANGE IN DRESSING.  WE COULD NOT ENJOY ANY OF THE EXCURSIONS NOR ENJOY THE JACUZZI/POOL BECAUSE OF THIS INJURY -- WAITED SO LONG TO TAKE THIS CRUISE BUT WILL TRY AGAIN SOME DAY.
5.0	Sail Date: Nov 07, 2015 /	Have no complaints about anything. The staff was wonderful. If you wanted or needed anything it was taken care of immediately. The food was good and you had so many places to choose from. We are thinking next time we will try the Oasis sister ship the Allure.
3.0	Sail Date: Nov 07, 2015 /	"We've been on the Oasis before, but this time, we found it getting shabby and worn around the edges.  The dining ""My Time"" was a disappointment.  Waiting in line for 20-30 minutes for my time is a joke.  Need more dining options available. We do not choose to eat in Windjammer, so are left with a few other choices. Most enjoyable was the Park Cafe at Central Park.  Really liked that one.  In our stateroom, the mattresses on our beds have large slumps in them - have pictures if you'd like to see them.  Also, leaving the ship early to carry our own luggage was a good move, too.  Will do that in the future.  That's all for now."
5.0	Sail Date: Nov 07, 2015 /	"The ship was beautiful and the food was great except for desserts.  We didn't finish any of the them.  They need a new dessert chef.

 

We loved the diving show and the ice skating show.  Come fly with me was OK and the welcome aboard comedy show was OK (one guy was OK, the other guy was not).

 The musical Cats was awful and we did not stay.

All of our rooms were great.

The staff in all venues were super."
5.0	Sail Date: Nov 07, 2015 /	We had an excellent experience.  The onboarding process went quickly and smoothly.  At no time did we feel crowded.  It was amazing how there was somewhere for everyone to be without being on top of one another.  There was almost no sense of motion throughout our cruise.  The production show 'CATS!' was as good as the Broadway touring show we saw back in 1987.  The salads and signature sandwich in the Park Café are to die for!  We ate lunch there almost every day.  Technical difficulties in the Aquatic Theater left us disappointed with that venue.  It took us 90 minutes from the time we began to leave Oasis until we were at our FLL airport gate; very efficient.
5.0	Sail Date: Nov 07, 2015 /	Ocean view Balcony room was very roomy, bed very comfortable! Our room was toward the front of the ship, very smooth sailing even though some days were very windy. Had an adjoining room with family and opened the balcony door to extend our balcony size!  Food was very good! Jonathan our head waiter and Shencaniah, asst waiter were wonderful. Entertainment was excellent! Full Broadway production of Cats! Great signing and dancing! The water show and ice shows great! Comedians great, Joe and Collin!  The acapella group Mo5aic also wonderful! Central Park beautiful on the ship, great photo spot!
5.0	Sail Date: Nov 07, 2015 /	"We thought we would be cramped on a ship with so many people.

It was just the opposite - there was so much to do!!  With all the different activities and different restaurants available - it was great!

The interactive TV was a valuable tool.  The activity at the restaurants were shown, so you were able to see what restaurants were busy or not.

Very impressed."
1.0	Sail Date: Nov 07, 2015 /	The food was worse then the buffet at a golden corral. Construction started right under our room promptly at 7am everyday. We had a view of a wine bar. Def not Central Park. My first cruise and def my last.
4.0	Sail Date: Oct 31, 2015 /	The ship was absolutely beautiful and never seemed crowded.  The service was outstanding.  The food was a little above average in the Windjammer and just average in the Silk Dining room.  The ship was always clean and organized.  A cruise of a lifetime!
4.0	Sail Date: Oct 31, 2015 /	"This ship is a beast! It's got some really nice shows and beautiful artwork. There is definitely plenty to see. We bought the ultimate drink package and it was worth it but the alcohol service left little to be desired. Rarely did we receive service with a smile. At the pool, we had to keep getting out for our drinks because the pool drink guy came maybe once an hour. At one point, the jacuzzi quit bubbling and no one came to fix it after talking to a few crew members. Our housekeeping service guy was lazy and left the room less than its best. It was by no means what I would consider a luxury cruise. 

 

The dining service, however... Oktay was our main waiter. He was PHENOMENAL. He was what all other customer service should be. We loved him and we tipped him a great big tip. We would book any cruise that man works on. 

 

Would I go on Oasis again? Unlikely. For the money, I'd rather take 2 Carnival cruises and get service with a smile. We try to be super nice to the people who work on the ships we cruise with. We know they are away from home and family so we try to be extra friendly and we understand that their jobs are demanding and their hours are long. But when we're consistently receive rolling eyes, disgusted faces looking back at us and overall crappy service in return, that's where we start looking elsewhere to spend our money. 

 

The shopping on board was less than desirable as well. But that's not a big deal unless you are looking to shop. 

 

Maybe your experience will be better and I hope it is, should you decide to book. Maybe there will be a different crew by then."
4.0	Sail Date: Oct 31, 2015 /	Had a blast! Ship was amazing. Something to do all the time. Looking forward to doing another one soon.I hurt my foot playing basketball and the staff was great in keeping me happy when I needed extra ice.
5.0	Sail Date: Oct 31, 2015 /	This ship is beyond words.  The size and the overall decorations is just wonderful.  So many pools and Jacuzzi that they all seemed empty.  No one place ever felt crowded.  The shows were truly top notch.  So many and different varieties we did not have a chance to see them all.  It helps to make reservations prior to getting on ship.  You get to skip the lines if you have reservations.  The food is great and so many options to choose from.  The crew was so helpful and attentive all around the ship.  I am already thinking of when I can do a 2nd trip on the Oasis.
4.0	Sail Date: Oct 31, 2015 /	we were extremely pleased with the cruise. It was too big a ship with lot of people. It was kind of hard to meet the same people again.  We have always travelled on ships with about 2000 people which is more intimate. The service was great.  The thing we did not like was to book the shows way ahead of the cruise date. We were not aware that you had to book that early. The comedy show could accommodate only 132 people so when we got on board we could not get a reservation as all shows were booked.  We waited in line the first time for an hour and could not get in.  On the second attempt we gave more time and got in.  With over 6000 people this show was too small.
2.0	Sail Date: Oct 31, 2015 /	"Being a loyal RCL cruiser, I must say that this boat and cruise experience was by far the worst of the 12 cruises I have done with Royal Caribbean. The dinner situation when it came to my time dining and seating was rediculous. Even with reservations, you would have to stand in line for several minutes, sometimes watching others without reservations being escorted in while you continued to wait in line.

    This was just one example of several different experiences with this particular boat (Oasis of the Seas) that just seemed to not have a handle on keeping things organized properly. The first night we were told all the shows were cancelled only to find out that some shows never to be repeated actually did happen. That was just day one, over the course of this cruise we as a couple had several bad experiences where shows were either cancelled or experienced technical difficulties, only to be cancelled after sitting and waiting an hour for the show to happen. In all of the 5-6 shows on the boat we had 4 different shows cancelled after waiting in lines or for an hour to see them...add to that that the aquatic show actually got cancelled 2 times on us in particular meaning we waited 3 different times for at least an hour or so, as it has limited seating to see the show once. The reservation system does not guarantee your seating, basically so you have to show up early!

    This cruise also had an emergency situation which most cruisers that I talked to felt was handled very poorly. Apparently a person jumped overboard only to land on a lifeboat, the crew was trying to get to this person, but the boat never started slowing down at all in the several minutes this event was happening. Then once the person actually fell, the boat sailed in circles for 5-6 hours looking for a needle in a haystack. There would have been a much better chance if say the boat had slowed down, plus this person may not have been pulled through the propulsion of the boat if it was stopped, where as that may have happened as we never tried to slow while this event happened. This catastrophe lead to another instance of absolutely no planning on the crews part as it delayed our arrival. This cause the few hundred people planning to leave the boat early to turn into thousands literally trying to get off the boat during the early departure procedure time. We were down very early for this departure and told we were in line on one end of the boat only to be told 15 minutes later we were not a line and had to get into a different line that now had literally hundreds of more people more than when we originally were told we were in a line by a crew member. It got worse from here as our line actually now stretch the entire length of the boat and they put other lines into our line basically putting hundreds of people in a different line in front of us even though that line was formed after ours. We stood in line for more than three hours for early departure, The crew seem to not have a clue how to handle a situation like this, so obviously emergency procedures are in serious need of changes or at least training so someone has a clue. When you get on the boat they ask if you have flights and what time....this should be in a system or database, gee once an emergency situation happens maybe we could ensure those people can actually get off the boat, or realize that this emergency situation and going to completely change the amount of person planning for early departure. 

    With all this happening, think about this, you plan your cruise to enjoy it, you plan your events, with other events in mind, so running into constant problems like this...well it pretty much completely ruined this cruise. While sitting there for hours waiting on shows not to happen we met several other people that cruised often and the theme was the same. Several stated they had been on the sister boats of the Oasis of the Seas and they were much better organized and did not run into these problems. To be honest, this was such a bad experience, after never cruising with any other company other than Royal Caribbean, I am actually considering trying them as this experience serious hurt RCL reputation for me. The only reason the rating is not lower is that at least the food was decent, although I have had better preparation on other RCL boats and I am loyal to a fault at times. I probably will not utilize Oasis of the seas in the next few years for sure, hoping for a crew changes for the better."
5.0	Sail Date: Oct 21, 2015 /	The Oasis of the Seas was an awesome experience for both my sister and I. We were impressed with the beauty and workmanship of the ship and the overall service and accommodations. Looking forward to booking another cruise in 2006.  Royal Caribbean is a wonderful and exciting cruise line.
5.0	Sail Date: Oct 21, 2015 /	"DEAR SIR;

THE SHIP WS GEAT..

THE ENTERTAINENT EXCELLENT...

THE PORT GOOD TOO...

ONLY COMPLAINT: DRESS CODE OF THE PASSANGERS MOST OF THEM HORRIBLE AND KIDS AT THE LATE SHOWS TOO"
4.0	Sail Date: Oct 21, 2015 /	"Overall a great cruise.  3 days is not enough time to enjoy and experience everything that this ship has to offer.  The updated cabin layout vs the other RCCL ships is one of the highlights of this ships.  The different layout makes the cabin feel larger than other ships.

 

Embarkation was a breeze.  got to the pier by 1215, on board by 1245. Cabins ready by 1pm.

 

We enjoyed the specialty restaurants on this ship.  Did not eat in the dining room or in the Windjammer.  Once on board we went to Johnny Rockets.  Great fresh burgers.  $7.95 for anything you want on the menu with the exception of a milkshake, but it does include a fountain soda.  We did miss sitting outside on the higher decks that you get with other ships.  1st night was at Giovanni's Table.  A very nice Italian restaurant served family style for appetizers and salads.  The pasta was spot on and the Filet of Beef melted in your mouth.  2nd night was at Sabor.  The best food at a specialty restaurant that I have ever had on a cruise ship.  Get the dinner tasting menu.  At first we were going to order a tasting for both my wife and myself, the waiter talked us out of it and I'm glad we did.  Each portion you ordered from the menu was enough for 2.  From fresh made at the table guacamole with fresh chips, all the way to the braised short rib in a mole sauce, the meal was 5 stars or more from beginning to end.  3rd night was at 150 central park, the meal was good, portions were very small.  Not worth the $40 per person cover.

 

Entertainment on board was plentiful.  Aqua show was very good, Come Fly with me was good.  Saw some of Cats, due to a ticket snafu couldn't get in until halfway through.  We ordered tickets online prior to sailing.  When we arrived on board,  they only had one ticket reserved, not two.  Costuming was good, and a nice show.

 

We enjoyed the entire ship on port day in Nassau.  We did not disembark, spent the day at the pool and whirlpools.  Lots of things to do on the ship if you choose not to go ashore.

 

Overall a good cruise.  We wanted to experience the ship as a whole and were happy with that.  Would we go on the ship again, maybe.  We enjoy the cruise ship feel, being able to sit at a restaurant and see the water go by during a nice dinner for 2, because of the location of the restaurant, we did not get that experience, no ocean views.  The normal Eastern/Western itineraries are not really something that we are looking for and that is all that this ship seems to offer.  If there was a southern Caribbean sailing we would go."
4.0	Sail Date: Oct 21, 2015 /	Couldn't read ship scheduled events on TV. It was moving too fast and ship didn't provide paper and pens to write it down. All shows on ship were booked before cruise started but was able to get a seat anyhow. Wish I would have known that you could book shows online before cruise sailing. Breath-taking ship! Very nice crew. Not a whole lot of activities during the day so we became bored. Shows at night were extremely excellent.
5.0	Sail Date: Oct 21, 2015 /	I had a blast enjoyed the ship so much to see and do. my only complaint I did'nt care for the food in the windjamer not a lot to choose from.  There was so much to see and do on that boat, we didn't get a chance to do everything because it was a short trip. However we will be going back next year and stay for a week, we have spreaded the word to others about the wonderful experience. I have never seen a boat that had so much to do.
5.0	Sail Date: Oct 21, 2015 /	Beautiful ship, excellent service and very clean. I will recommend everybody to take a trip with this ship. I will also recommend to have a balcony, so you can enjoy the beautiful views at sea, have a glass of wine before dining.
5.0	Sail Date: Oct 21, 2015 /	It's very nice vacation. Everything is perfect on cruise. It's great place to stay with a little toddler that I don't need to worry about taking little one on vacation. I'm planning to take next cruise to burn idea with royal Caribbean.
5.0	Sail Date: Oct 10, 2015 /	Loved this beautiful ship. From the first glimpse, you actually realize how huge it is. Takes your breath away when you 1st enter. Windjammer awaits you. Rooms aren't available till 1 pm.  See, eat up!! Thus begins your trip.  Pools everywhere.  Central Park was our favorite! Reviewing now want to go back
4.0	Sail Date: Oct 10, 2015 /	"The only reason I am giving this a 4 star is because the cruise line just cant get our dinning room seating right.  We were sat in a hallway next to a busing station again.  Thankfully we were able to use the Coastal Kitchen, which is a restaurant adjacent from the concierge lounge.  We did not return to the dining room the remainder of the trip.

Coastal Kitchen is a welcome addition for Suite guests and the staff their and the concierge lounge were exceptional."
5.0	Sail Date: Oct 10, 2015 /	From excellent food, service, entertainment and activities to total relaxation in the spa we had an awesome time!  We enjoyed the solarium adults only area and there was always plenty of activities to choose from.
3.0	Sail Date: Oct 10, 2015 /	"I had my time dining and I choked and gagged, every night going and leaving the dining room.  I do feel that after paying to go on this cruise, that I would be in a smoke free environment.  I did not read anywhere in all the paperwork that there was smoking onboard.  If I had known this, I would not have taken, this cruise,""very very unhealthy""."
2.0	Sail Date: Oct 10, 2015 /	"Way too many people, pools and jacuzzi looks like a bee hive, lines every where and quality of food not good at all. Cruise too expensive and they charge for everything, even for the sauna. Although I have to mention that the Gym was big and have a lot of equipment.

 The destinations are not good either.

Nothing to do after 12.30 am. Very disappointed!!!!!"
5.0	Sail Date: Oct 10, 2015 /	The ship was very smooth even in rough seas.  We did not need sea sick patches.  The restaurants were top shelf.  The entertainment was very professional  The ship has plenty of activities for all ages.  You really did not get the feeling that there was any where near 6000 guests on board with you.  The staff were very helpful and happy all the time.  Now the casino did get to keep $5.00 in their slot machines.  We will take this cruise again,as it was wonderful.
5.0	Sail Date: Oct 03, 2015 /	I loved it  ...It went by way to quick ,this was my second time on oasis  ,they dining staff was great and shows where great even though I seen half of them 2 years ago when I was on
5.0	Sail Date: Sep 26, 2015 /	Had a great time. Would do it again. Ship was amazing. Staff were amazing. Royal Caribbean is the best. CheapCriuses is definitely the place to book!
5.0	Sail Date: Sep 26, 2015 /	nothing but the best was delivered to us during our vacation on royal Caribbean. Activity throughout the day at sea was incredible. There were always something to do so you can never get bored. Everything was professionally uniformed when we embarked and disembarked at every destination
2.0	Sail Date: Sep 26, 2015 /	"overall it was a great cruise enjoyed myself and what a beautiful ship.  However, there are room for improvements on the following.

 

Anytime Dining - the lines were long weather you had reservation.  The first formal night I did not make reservation. However, you should not wait in line for 45 minutes before. Seating.  Something should be done about.

When getting off the ship it took forever to get off.  Getting on the process was excellent since I am a platinum member. Why it did not work as well while getting off.  Overall all other services was good."
5.0	Sail Date: Sep 19, 2015 /	Our cruise on the Oasis of the Seas, Sept 19-26, was fantastic. The ship was great, lot's to do. Our travel expert, Kerri Winston, was professional and helped through the booking process. A true professional.
3.0	Sail Date: Sep 19, 2015 /	"I have been on other Royal Carribean cruises and they were fun.  This trip the following things made say hmmmm

Having to pull up the toilet seats every time i had to use the restroom, why someone place the flush behind the toilet seat was stupid. the germs were nasty.

The bartenders and other staff were rude, it was like it was time for them to go home and stay home if they didn't want to service the customers.

It was so unorganized with the shows, no direct to the guest on what shows needed to be booked and what shows didn't. 

We should of gotten a weekly planner along with a daily one to help everyone plan their time on the ship.

You need more entertainment during the day around the pool, for people to sit and watch.

Our Server at dinner was nice, Ivan table 565 and Gilbert.  Very helpful.

Annette was great also, she helped with the jewelry section and the $10 sales.

To be honest I would not go back on the Oasis again, and I am not going to advise anyone else to go on that ship.  By talking with other guest we all had the same issues."
5.0	Sail Date: Sep 19, 2015 /	was a knowledgeable and friendly everytime I called.  They would check for updated discounts available.  We received an email for a discounted price to Atlantis and booked it.  We were thinking for such a short amount of time we had on Paradise Island whether it was worth it or not...But it definately was!!!  We have 2 children 9 and 11 and took a taxi ride over, it was very easy to find our way, no lines, was able to do all the slides several times. The ship was AMAZING.  The Adventure Ocean kids club was top notch, they had so much fun.  The Aqua show very good.  Will book again!
2.0	Sail Date: Sep 19, 2015 /	We have sailed more than 25 times with other cruise lines and were anxious to try out the Oasis of the Seas. Royal Caribbean caters to the European and South American markets more than to North Americans. There was loud popular music playing all over the ship, which was not something we enjoyed. The food quality was absolutely horrible. We had My Time Dining and the crowd control even with reservations was really bad. The food in the American Icon dining room was better, but still not made to a high standard. The crew was fairly friendly, but there were long lines for shows, even with reservations, not enough movies, and too many extra fee activities. The mattress in our cabin was very old and sagged in the middle and the carpet needed replacing. Thank goodness we had a balcony cabin to get a respite from all the loud noise and to see the ocean, but our cruise dollar would have been better spent somewhere else. There were so many issues that we will never sail with Royal Caribbean again. Basically we couldn't wait to get home and we have never felt like that before.
5.0	Sail Date: Sep 12, 2015 /	"I took my first cruise and it was the most enjoyable experience. I had a staff member name Puta Diana he was the most amazing staff and kept my room excellent. I will travel Royal Carribbean again in August 2016. Also,  is a great company to book your trip with if you want to travel and save money. 

Thanks!"

3.0	Sail Date: Sep 12, 2015 /	This was an excellent cruise! The week before our cruise, the Oasis had a stomach virus thing going around. They were very diligent about thoroughly cleaning the ship before we got on and diligent throughout the cruise to keep hand sanitizer available. The crew and shows were top notch and the food was excellent. Would defiantly travel Royal Caribbean again
5.0	Sail Date: Sep 12, 2015 /	I have been on four different cruises including Oasis of the Seas and this ship is hands hands down the best Ship I've ever been on. The shows, staff, and rooms were all impressive. The Destinations could have been a little better but all in all a great experience.
5.0	Sail Date: Sep 12, 2015 /	The Cruise ship and staff are Amazing. I felt well cared for from the time of arrival to departure. There is so much to do on this ship, your head will be kept spinning. I Highly recommend this cruise line of over Carnival Cruise line any day. Royal Caribbean is like  Macy's or Saks 5th Avenue (Royal Caribbean) and Carnival Cruise line would be equivalent to Walmart. They both attract a different audience. I just prefer Royal Caribbean Oasis of the Seas. This is something that you have to experience for yourself. Go grand or don't go at all.
5.0	Sail Date: Sep 12, 2015 /	We had a great time on board Oasis of the Seas.  The ship was enormous.  In some ways too big.  You realize that there were 6K people on board during embarkation and debarkation.

5.0	Sail Date: Sep 05, 2015 /	Royal Caribbean set my cruise experience to the next level. we would love to experience more Royal Caribbean cruises in the future.  The ship sale on deck 5 is a great experience. The entertainment is 5stars. The crew is the best very helpful. over all is an experience my family and i will never forget.
4.0	Sail Date: Sep 05, 2015 /	I enjoyed the cruise, had lots of fun. wish the food choices were a little better. I also would recommend getting  an ocean facing cabin especially if this is your first cruise. central park was nice, but I would prefer the water.
5.0	Sail Date: Sep 05, 2015 /	"This is the best ship. It's my 2nd time and i would not care if it never left the dock.

Already scheduled for another trip, Best entertainment. loved the different restaurants.

Check out the wiped out cafe."
5.0	Sail Date: Sep 05, 2015 /	"We had a wonderful time on our Cruise of the Eastern Caribbean. All of the waiters, house attendants and service  people throughout the ship were vary carrying and treated us as family.

All of the Shows were Outstanding and terrific with plenty of music and dancing by the Cast. The only one we didn't care for was 'CATS'. Most of the audience left at intermission as it was boring."
4.0	Sail Date: Sep 05, 2015 /	The Oasis of the Seas is a fantastic and jaw dropping ship with all its architecture and amazing ability to place so many environments on the ship.  However after traveling cruising on several other Royal Caribbean ships the Oasis exceeding expectations for its grandness, which also led to what I see as its need for improvements.  There were many activities and shows however with 5,000 to 6,500 people the venues for events for way to small to accommodate the people who wanted to participate.  Many of the shows were not available to most who wanted to see them even when trying to reserve a time slot.  Although the dining room service and food was outstanding the Wind Jammer food was mediocre at best.  After traveling on the Grandeur of the Seas the food expectation was set high (my greatest thanks to the Chefs) and the Oasis of the seas did not even come close.  Most times the food was cold and lacked flavor.  4 stars my be a little high but 3 what have been to low considering the other great services provided on board.
4.0	Sail Date: Sep 05, 2015 /	"This was my wife and I first cruise and we wanted to leave nothing to chance. It took more than 5 months to plan to insure everything went well. We were celebrating our 25 wedding anniversary and we wanted share a wonderful experience together away from distractions. The cruise, excursions and overall experience was wonderful. The title of this review ""From Disaster to Glory!"" is important to highlight because of the threat of derailment. This began when the airline (US Airways) mislabeled our luggage and we arrived in Fort Lauderdale with only our carry on bags. Thankfully the cruise line went above and beyond to help in any way possible. The stress this added to our first days on board quickly faded by the warm reception and positive staff onboard Oasis of the Seas. We were so taken by the wonderful atmosphere, we already booked another cruise."
4.0	Sail Date: Aug 29, 2015 /	From room service to overall experience on this cruise was excellent everything worked like a clock work. From boarding the ship to exit the ship and all the crew members were extremely helpful and courteous. We would have enjoyed 100% if we had the option of Halal ( Muslim ) Food Beef Steak. We enjoyed the fish and sure appreciate the lamb chops and lamb shanks were Halal and prepared perfectly. The shows we enjoyed a lot and Inshallah will go again...Thank you all.
4.0	Sail Date: Aug 29, 2015 /	"I wasn't sure if I would like a big ship - but it turned out to be a lot of fun. It never felt as if there were 6000+ people on board. Plenty of lounge chairs at the pool and lots of fun activities. This ship would be great for families with children of all ages. A few too many kids for my taste - but enjoyable nonetheless. Food was above average in the buffet area and okay in the dining room. My only two complaints would be that the ""my time dining"" was very unorganized. People without reservations were seated before those of us with reservations. My other complaint would be that the music played at the pool was terrible. Constant calypso steel band stuff and nothing else."
5.0	Sail Date: Aug 29, 2015 /	This will NOT be our last time onboard the Oasis of the Sea.  This ship was so much fun.  There is so much to do, you will NOT get bored.  All the shops, shows, and many restaurants to visits will keep you busy at all times.  If you have not experiences this ship, you must add it to your bucket list!
1.0	Sail Date: Aug 22, 2015 /	"I want to share my experience : “ The Worst cruise experience ever""

 

 

Beginning with the arrival of the cruise. The most rude and unprofessional staff. Our destination ports were changed at the last minute for security but lead to Costa Maya? Have you been to this port? Do you guys knows how dangerous is that city? People offering Sex and drug at the arrival of the port and downtown. Contaminated area and muddy beach. Taxi drivers taking advantage of the poor passengers trying to sell overpriced tours ?.

 

Upon returning to the cruise were more than 300 people screaming and unhappy in guest services because of the experience in Costa Maya. A Nicaraguan agent took our names and cabin number and told us that someone was going to give us a follow up in regards to our concerns.  A family of 9 people were given complementary dinner and not others? What is the difference between them and the other guests around?.

 

I sent a letter to the captain and the letter was returned to my cabin? I went down to guest services again to leave the letter to the supervisor Diane. She took it again and make sure that the captain would receive the letter. The first time I leave the letter I gave it to Stanley's the manager and asked him please forward it to the captain.This lack of communication in guest services it shows me what kind of unprofessional and rude people i was dealing with. Guest service agent Benjamin Claudine was very unprofessional. It was 24:00 and order room service: it was 2:30 am and even the order did not arrive?  I called Claudine and she told me that room service closed at 1:00 a.m.? Why they didn’t told me while i  was ordering  and that they were closing at 1AM? and besides I call and she put me on hold 15 minutes and additional I called back and she did not respond again .... That I was frustrated to be treated that way.

 

If you call to guest services or the PBX they take approximately 15 up to 30 minutes to answer. I asked why? The agent told me that they don’t have enough people VS 5000 passengers?

 

They were teenagers having alcohol by the pool late at night and no security around?

 

It was my birthday and nobody did anything. I most recognized the great Job of my room attendant He was The BEST! and makes my birthday happy with a nice towel with the shape of a elephant on my bed.

 

The chef of the Solarium was rude. They had bad shrimp on the buffet.  I reported to the hostess that the shrimp were not fresh. The hostess brought the chef  to my table and in addition to that the chef told me that i didn’t know what i was talking about and turned away in front of many people. LEAVING ME SPEECHLESS with his attitude. Ms. Anna was friendly and she invite us for free dinner because of the inconveniences.

 

At checkout Ms. Katia from guest services and other 2 agents i forgot the names told us that Royal Caribbean will be contacting all the guest in regards to a compensation. 

 

I called today Monday to know what they will do for us because of all the inconveniences and a young woman named ""Jackie"" from guest relations corporate informs me that we are not going to do anything? I told her that the cruise staff said that someone will follow up and call us about our bad experience and compensation. She replied that the staff was misinformed and that will not do anything about it. I told her I wanted to talk to his manager and she said that she don't have a manager? supervisor? anyone? I told her I did not think was true and that I was going RECORD our conversation and then she hang up the phone.WHAT A RUDE PEOPLE !!!!!!

 

We are so unhappy and frustrated 

 

Tell me!

 

 if you are in my position how will you feel? what kind of service is this? How are you in business? Our last cruise on Royal Caribbean years ago was an unforgettable experience and was great! This time we didn’t have the same luck.

 

I am very disappointed and i want the email of the CEO of Royal Caribbean because i want to take this to the highest level.

 

Best regards,

4.0	Sail Date: Aug 22, 2015 /	"I've always enjoyed my vacations aboard Royal Caribbean Cruise Line ships, some better than others. This was no different. 

My only complaint is the food in the Windjammer restaurant did not live up to the standards set on previous cruises. I hope this is a trend Royal Caribbean can reverse."
4.0	Sail Date: Aug 22, 2015 /	"We love the Oasis.  The different neighborhoods make it a great ship. 

The Icon dining room  (we went 3 times and the doors were late opening twice) needs to work out some kind of waiting line management.  The lines were not clearly defined and people sometimes inadvertently crowded the lines.  Also, the posted menu outside the dining room had not been updated and was not correct.

The Sudoku puzzles were not put out every day even after REPEATED requests."
4.0	Sail Date: Aug 22, 2015 /	I enjoyed the cruise line immensely. There were lots to do and the entertainment was great. Staff was professional, ship is beautiful and relaxing. Not much more to say. I had a great time. Oh and the food was great in all dining rooms!
5.0	Sail Date: Aug 22, 2015 /	We cruised for 7 days on the Oasis of the Seas  out of Ft. Lauderdale..  We enjoyed this cruise as well as any other cruise we have been on.  It was our first time m this type of ship. We were not disappointed!  We have enjoyed every cruise that we have been on.
2.0	Sail Date: Aug 22, 2015 /	I have been on 2 cruises prior to this one with another cruise line. This was my first time cruising with Royal Caribbean and it was by fart worse experience ever. I understand that they were trying to keep us safe from the hurricane, but I feel like they could have used better judgement as to where to detour the boat. Costa Maya is the worst place you could ever take an entire boat of people. It was absolutely nothing to see there and it smelled horrible. The beach wasn't available. It was just a horrible place to be on vacation especially knowing that there were other places that could have been chosen.
3.0	Sail Date: Aug 15, 2015 /	"I have traveled with Oasis of the sea before , first time I thought that was the great cruise and that's why I booked two rooms for my whole family again,

I don't think i would ever travel with Royal Caribbean again . The ship wasn't clean like before   I had to asked to clean our sofa because of all the dirty spots on it and they cleaned the next day but it was a bad impression. The only friendly people we met were two guys at the dinner time and their manager .  Great people. It was a pleasure to know them . Also two ladies at spa were great . My daughter and me had great experience with them.   other than that most of people had grumpy attitude . The food quality at the buffe wasn't comparable with before . Last day shopping at the ship we had to Waite more than two hours in line to purchase at the shops .   Shows quality wasn't comparable with the experience we had before the comedy show was horrible    Kids care bad experience. Nothing like before 😢After spending 20000 for this vacation and fly from Oregon to Florida to go withis ship out whole family were disappointed .       Best of luck.    Sarah"
5.0	Sail Date: Aug 15, 2015 /	The cruise was absolutely awesome! Something was going on somewhere all the time. Just the way I like it. I do however like free popcorn. The water show was my favorite. What a vacation joy.
5.0	Sail Date: Aug 15, 2015 /	Everything was amazing and organized.  Able to relax or go as much as you wanted.  The entertainment was top notch.  The crew and staff were personable.
5.0	Sail Date: Aug 08, 2015 /	A fabulous ship with central park and royal promenade (is like a shopping mall) are centrally located.  Boardwalk is at the rear with a carousel and water theater.  The shows are great (do not take kids to watch Cat's because it is a full production, 2.5 hours, but it was beautiful), the food is excellent, and the activities are so much fun. We were always busy doing something. The staff is wonderful and extremely helpful. The stateroom attendant (room #8128) as well as waitress and staff in our dining room (table #139) were awesome. We loved every part of this trip. Will do it again
5.0	Sail Date: Aug 08, 2015 /	Amazing Cruise!! Excellent Food, Excellent Service!!... Great destinations!... Just a little disappointed about St Marteen, Honestly I think this was going to be a better place, it looks kind of abandoned.
4.0	Sail Date: Aug 01, 2015 /	This ENORMOUS ship has a little something for everyone. It was a little too gigantic for my taste because it almost felt like a large wing of a mall floating at sea.
5.0	Sail Date: Aug 01, 2015 /	Fabulous trip. the ship was so beautiful. never saw anything like it. the food was really good. We're planning on going again. we took so many pictures. there was so many beautiful places to take pictures at on the ship. we were always busy doing something. At the end of the cruise, we had not even seen all the ship. we want to come back again on the same ship so we can see it all. the formal dinner was excellent. and the staff all over the ship were so very helpful and very, very nice. staff from all over the world. pretty neat.
5.0	Sail Date: Aug 01, 2015 /	The Oasis was a fascinating cruise.  Very different from many ships we've cruised on.  Lots to do, good food and entertainment.  Wish there were more ports to visit, but I guess being such a huge vessel it's difficult to get into most ports.
4.0	Sail Date: Jul 25, 2015 /	"If you like these huge floating cities, this is the cruise for you. Over 6,300 passengers on this cruise and I am told 2,500 crew, this is a HUGE amount of people ! The ship is an engineering marvel, never imagined so many pools and hot tubs. Tons of restaurants, personally resent the specialty restaurants. The food in regular included restaurants should be good enough, and in fact the included food in the dining rooms and Windjammer was great. Great = fantastic variety and amazing taste / quality given the huge amounts served. Never ate at specialty restaurant, but probably good place to get away from the ""herd"". Entertainment was incredible and beyond expectation. Shows have world class talent doing wonderful things.

Downside: 1. MONEYSQUEEZERS - They try to squeeze money out of you at every turn, every little thing is a calculated to cost you the max they can get. It starts off with a glass of wine with dinner, $10 pineapple drinks, tours which can cost a lot less from very qualified tour operators. 2. THE HERD - Even they were very efficient of handling the huge number of people, its just overwhelming the first day (unless you come from a large city) people everywhere, everything full, everyone milling about. During Disembarkation, they messed up somehow and got behind letting too many numbers out at the same time. There was line cutting, flare-ups and long, long lines to get luggage and get out. Everything was going smooth sometime before us, but when we at # 57 were released, we joined a stopped dead still line, and they kept releasing groups which made the lines almost 5 times longer and caused the problem. I think it was going slow and they decided to get everyone off the ship so they could board the new group (out with the old and in with the new"". 

Personally, I am going to see which ships I sailed on before, where it was a little quieter, a little more personally luxurious.

Special thanks to the exceptionally nice crew, amazing how people from all over the world can work together in such apparent harmony. Did not see any Americans (other than entertainers). Are we just not capable of being so nice and are we not willing to work as hard under their conditions ? Special thanks go to cabin steward Boengaradji Yerri, ""Crazy Yerri"" who was really a funny dude. Wait staff were so, so nice and once they knew us, pampered us anticipating our wants... thanks to Gilman Fernandes, Andrii Purtov and Ganna Poturai. They did such a nice job we actually sought out their stations to be spoiled !"
5.0	Sail Date: Jul 11, 2015 /	All in all the cruise was awesome.  The ship exceeds your wildest expectations and dreams. There are so many activities to do on board. I highly recommend sailing aboard the Oasis Of The Seas. You wouldn't regret it...can I say awesome again. ...
5.0	Sail Date: Jul 11, 2015 /	Everything is first class on this cruise and the destinations are amazing. You will never be bored because there is always a list of things to choose from on the ship. The shows are great, the food is excellent, and the activities (from shopping to pamper parties or even mini golf) are so much fun. I loved every part of this trip.
4.0	Sail Date: Jul 11, 2015 /	A beautiful ship with central park and royal promenade centrally located with elevators on both end.  Broadway at the rear with a carousel, hot dogs, and ice cream.  The staff is wonderful and extremely helpful.  Only downfall is a lot of extras that cost $$$...Ben and Jerry's ice cream place, popcorn, cotton candy, etc.  And, you can't bring water aboard!!!
5.0	Sail Date: Jul 04, 2015 /	This is our 29th cruise and was by far, the nicest experience yet! This cruise caters to all ages and the ship itself is beautiful! Excellent accommodations attentive staff in all areas, LOTS to see and do and unless you are going on Silver Seas, the best bang for your buck! I would recommend this cruise to all! ,
3.0	Sail Date: Jun 27, 2015 /	"This was our 15th cruise and 5th with Royal Caribbean.  For me, the ship seemed very enclosed.  Don't get me wrong, it was nice, but it was a little like being in a shopping mall.  Even though Boardwalk and Central Park are open air venues, they seemed enclosed as well.  It doesn't feel like you're on a ship most of the time.  You can't look out to the water from any of the public areas unless you go up top or to the aft, or hang in your room. 

The ship was very stable.  We didn't feel the movement of the ocean much at all, which is probably what they were shooting for, but it seemed odd.  We all commented on how it's nice to have a little rolling with the waves, especially at night. 

The upper deck is nice, but it seems so far up and away from the water.  There are a lot of gimmicks to keep people occupied, so the ship never really seemed over crowded.  One of my favorite things was the hot dog bar.  The brats were good.

As for the shows, the Abba show was good and the Aqua show was good as well.  We didn't do any of the others.  Everyone, including numerous members of the crew said that Cats was really boring.  I was surprised at how many crew members we bold enough to trash a show on their own ship, but it must be that bad.  Either way, make sure you schedule these things online in advance like they say because we found out that they really do sell out.

Oasis is really nice and very innovative and we had a good time, but that said, we will go back to the Radiance class ships, which are definitely our favorites.  We've been on the Radiance and Serenade previously and will be doing the Jewel in the spring."
4.0	Sail Date: Jun 20, 2015 /	"In general, I liked the ship and the quality and variety of amenities.  Food was great and the staff was always there to help out.

Two biggest complaints were that Bingo was $60 and the room was packed.  They played three games and gave away a total of $3000 in prizes approximately.  So it ended up being a ""get more money out of you"" scam... which is very annoying to me.

I thought the cruise shopper on channel 22 was very mis-leading.  That appears to be just full of kick-backs to the cruiseline.  Which in turn feels like a scam."
1.0	Sail Date: Jun 20, 2015 /	Casino Asst Mgr Emma Cuadra and Mgr Ray Denton are cheats and liars.  Do not go to the casino on board!  Cheated me and then liad about circumstances.  I will never cruise Royal Caribbean again!!
5.0	Sail Date: Jun 13, 2015 /	"This cruise was GREAT in every way.  We were traveling with 5 grandkids, ages 5 to 14.  Everyone of them commented on how wonderful the ship was with so many things to do.  The ship was clean, the staff was friendly, the food was great and plentiful.  We had a Central Park View Balcony. It was absolutely beautiful, the trees below and the lights and music in the evening.  There are many places to eat all over the ship.  Although the Oasis is the largest cruise ship, it was easy to get around and you would never know it by the number of passengers.  It never was crowded.  It was the easiest for embarking and disembarking of all the 20 cruises we've been on.

I would definitely cruise the Oasis again."
5.0	Sail Date: Jun 13, 2015 /	Everything was wonderful on the cruise.  The room Stewart, Dexter Matthews, was extremely courteous and helpful with showing us what to expect and how to use the TV programming to understand more of the ship's accommodations.  The room was always kept immaculate, the ship itself was always being clean and kept up to high standards.  It was an extremely relaxing and wonderful time... I would highly recommend Oasis of the Sea cruise.
5.0	Sail Date: Jun 13, 2015 /	This was my first cruise and I had an absolutely great time.  The ship was everything that I had heard it would be.  The dinning room and food was top notch.  My room was great and enjoyed the balcony. The shows I attended were very entertaining and the peace and quiet of the ocean was unbelievable.  The excursions I went on were very nice, priced well and had fun on all of them.
5.0	Sail Date: Jun 06, 2015 /	"The staff was incredible,food was ok,I think they should have more healthy wholesome variety or at least offer to sell it. The cabin was small and  clean,BUT,there was an odd odor in my bathroom..I called and maintenance fixed it immediately,apparently they did not empty out ""toilet"" issues..When we arrived in Ft.Lauderdale the entire cruise smelled nasty,I asked what was that odor,""toilet"" issues.. why could they not wait until the cruise was empty ???  

The kids room needs a more qualified staff and more interesting activities."
5.0	Sail Date: Jun 06, 2015 /	This is our second time on the Oasis of the Seas and we have already booked for next year on the Oasis.  We love all the activities on the ship, service, food, and entertanment.
5.0	Sail Date: May 30, 2015 /	This is a great ship. With as many people on board you could still always find chairs at a pool. Service was excellent especially from our cabin steward Stanley and our waiters Seri & Jack. This is a beautiful ship. Only down side was the long lines at the zipline and flow riders. Seemed like they could have sped up the pace for the zipline other wise great cruise.
5.0	Sail Date: May 30, 2015 /	First time cruiser -- everything is new but staff on Oasis made everything very easy to understand. Excellent food, lots of of activities, super friendly staff etc. Everything is awesome. Thanks royal caribbean a lot for this excellent vacation.

3.0	Sail Date: May 30, 2015 /	"Really had a good time and enjoyed all there is to offer on this cruise. The ship was amazing and we really enjoyed our Central Park stateroom.

The only compliant/issue I had is with the supervisor/manager of Photo (female, blonde South African). She was very rude and a displeasure to deal with, in an attempt to resolve an issue of a photo package (purchased by friends prior to our cruise). The issue was not resolved until our friends had to directly call Royal Caribbean."
5.0	Sail Date: May 30, 2015 /	First time going on a cruise and I truly felt like royalty....... Most relaxed I have felt in years... now I see what I have been missing. will take another cruise in 2017......
3.0	Sail Date: May 23, 2015 /	I liked the cruise but, compared to many RCL cruises, the food was very poor.  I found the Windjammer to not be up to the quality of other Windjammers.  When I inquired about the poor quality the wait staff told me that the Chef is responsible for the changes.  RCL needs to change the Chef.
5.0	Sail Date: May 23, 2015 /	WOW Cruise on the Oasis! Great cruise, even better than last time. Great ship, food, entertainment, and service. Did not like the new/future dining room set up/idea. Gone is the beautiful look.
5.0	Sail Date: May 23, 2015 /	The Oasis of the Seas is a phenomenal ship, I have been on several cruises and this by far has been the best cruise ship.  There is more than enough activities to engage in and the crew was great.  There were moments when I actually forgot I was on a cruise ship.
4.0	Sail Date: May 23, 2015 /	"This ship is the  ultimate! It is always clean and maintained. The stateroom, food, shows, music and shopping are all fantastic !!! The stateroom attendant as well as waitress and staff in our dining room were awesome. The onboard activities are plentiful and theres something for all. I suggest relaxing at the solarium for adults / couples. Several jacuzzis there and its an area for 16 and over !

If you sign up for any excursion, ask questions !!! We were not given all details and information  we ended up needing as far as what we need to take to excursion both from an ID perspective and for the excursion itself. Also ask to see all excursions available. We were not shown all available and found out later there were many other choices.

Spa is overrated. 

Fitness center is state of the art.

They do beach bootcamps at some port of calls but dont provide water so be prepared if you sign up. I think they should ptrovide water since you pay for these hootcamps"
5.0	Sail Date: May 16, 2015 /	"PROS: This cruise was far better than the previous cruises I had been on. The Oasis of the Seas is truly an all inclusive ship. I vacationed with my aunt. She is 83 and has physical challenges. The cruise line loaned my aunt a wheelchair, while on the ship. She used it as a walker and there was no stopping her. She wanted to see and do everything there. She couldn't go on shore while at port. I felt comfortable leaving her there. I came back one day and it took me 3 hours to find her. June, Stateroom Attendant was excellent, very knowledgeable and performed his job great. He made sure the room was clean, waiting some days outside until we left, so as not to disturb us (we forgot to use the Do Not Disturb tag). He gave us directions to various places on the ship. He was pleasant and greeted us with a smile each time he saw us. Luis and Muhammad and the assistant waiter in the dining room were excellent. I was very comfortable knowing that each meal would always be prepared paying particular attention to my extensive list of food allergies. These individuals made my vacation a wonderful experience. I was happy to see them every day.

CONS: I was shopping for a designer bag and electronics. Jenna, the port shopping person, did not recommended stores. Not everyone wants to shop for diamonds. The food (that I could eat) was great. I would've like to see more selection of foods without the "" BIG 8"" allergens included (milk, eggs, peanuts, tree nuts, fish, shellfish, soy, wheat.)  I understand that it is difficult, but possible. Gluten free station in the Windjammer is a start. I also picked through the food selection at the Solarium Bistro. Healthy and gluten free is not the same as Allergen Free."
4.0	Sail Date: May 16, 2015 /	"I gave this wonderful cruise a 4 star rating...couldn't call it a perfect 10 because of it's poor excuse for a kids' club.  We registered our 3 year old twins who were so excited to be Aquanots.  What they experienced was a big empty room with one adult sitting in a chair.  No toys-no planned activities-nothing!  The person did not introduce herself, nor did she ask the kids' names.  Our son wouldn't stay, but our daughter did.  We picked her up in an hour...still no toys, activities, and the ""youth counselor"" sitting in a chair.  Our daughter said she did ""nothing"" the entire time.  I was really angry that the daily program listed all of the activities that had taken place that day.  We talked to several other parents who had the same experience. If a well-staffed, activity oriented, friendly kid's club is what you want, sail on Disney.  Our two cruises with Disney were wonderful for our kids."
5.0	Sail Date: May 16, 2015 /	I had a blast and look forward to my next cruise in May 2017. I will definitely recommend Royal Caribbean to anyone that would like to experience their first cruise.
5.0	Sail Date: May 16, 2015 /	The ship was amazing and the service and staff couldn't  have been better. It was a great experience and I would definitely  do it again! Loved the ports too!
5.0	Sail Date: May 16, 2015 /	We had a great experience on the Oasis of the seas. The food is excellent and well prepared. The dining crews were so nice, polite , very attentive on their customer's needs and accommodating on the needs of the diners. Special commendation for Sandeep Rana /Damian Chin; Cheryll Caballero, Jerrich del Barrio, Vianney Manseras and Sheramie Atienza crews at Icon Grill. Also Arnel Barrameda at the Solarium. These crews made us like a VIP. We have our granddaughter and we were able to enjoy our time in the ship and outside because of free daycare. Our housekeeper Anthony Alexis provided as a clean and well arranged room. Entertainment is perfect. We will repeat this experience again at Oasis of the Seas.
3.0	Sail Date: May 16, 2015 /	Overall I would rate the trip a 7 out of 10. The ship and service were spectacular. The itinerary was okay. only 1/2 a day in Nassau with some rain. The dinning room food options were weak compared to my previous cruises on carnival and Norwegian ships. The stateroom was okay, but shower extremely small and broken shower head. The entertainment on he ship was out of this world, from performers to production... really nice. Comedians were excellent! As usual, the dinning room staff go out of their way to please you, don't know how they keep up such great service. The food on the 16th deck dining buffet was very good. The steak and meats option on the main dinning  room were not so good. They offered lobster from Maine, when in fact it's Caribbean lobster. NOT THE SAME!!! embarking and disembarking was very organized and quick considering the amount of people. Good job!!! Overall a good trip.
5.0	Sail Date: May 16, 2015 /	This was the best cruise I have ever been on. It was my 16th. The dining room staff in the American Icon were superb.Elena,Jaisen, and Head waiter Denzel. I mentioned that I liked terimosue (sp) and they said it was not going to be in the dining room that week. But all I had to do was order it and they could have it for me the next day. I thought that was Wonderful. Then Denzel came over and said he would get it for me that Night! WOW And he did. In less than 5 minutes I had it. In the Tequilla Bar I had my first margarita with nachos and salsa I mentioned that it would be great with some cheese.  He said you want cheese? I will get you some. Off he went across the boardwalk to Johnny Rockets for cheese!!! Again with the WOW.  Another night I needed a shawl and I was told they would be put out on the wrong night. In the Prince George store I asked the young man would he consider getting me one since I was given the wrong day, He said No problem mam meet me at 4:30 and I will have it for you. Perfection.  Your officers all spoke throughout the ship. on some cruises they even some Rcci  they act like they don't see you. But on this ship you were greeted , asked if you were enjoying you cruise .  I loved it
5.0	Sail Date: May 16, 2015 /	I am not going to even bother breaking it down because there is no way to ! It was an all together AWESOME experience all around. I HIGHLY recommend this ship , company , and whichever vacation they are involved with !
5.0	Sail Date: May 16, 2015 /	"We enjoyed this cruise ship. The Oasis of the Seas was by far the biggest, cleanest and fun ship we have ever experienced in our more than 10 cruises we have been on. The resta



urants and food were awesome and the shows magnificent. Our cabin steward and our wait staff were friendly and personable."
5.0	Sail Date: May 09, 2015 /	This was the best cruise I have ever been on.  I was a little worried at first because of the size of the ship and how many people, crew and passengers that it would be crowded and hard to do anything.  Boy was I wrong.  This is an amazing ship and the venues are wonderful.  I would highly recommend this cruise and everything about it to anyone who wants to go on a cruise of a lifetime.
5.0	Sail Date: May 09, 2015 /	Ship far exceeds my expectations!  Awesome service, great amenities, fun activities.  Our family had a blast! Will definitely be cruising Royal again soon!
4.0	Sail Date: May 09, 2015 /	"We had a great time!  We plan on cruising on this ship again but this time the Eastern Caribbean trip.

We would have given this a 5 star rating but the food was only good not great overall.  If you can spring for the extra cost to the upgraded dining experience for the additional restaurants on board, then its a must.  The service was great and the ship was extremely clean.  We really enjoyed this vacation!"
4.0	Sail Date: May 09, 2015 /	We loved the cruise and had an awesome time. The ship has plenty to do and despite the large number of people, plenty of room. My only criticisms would be (1) the quality of the food and (2) our stateroom cleanliness. The food was just ok. Although dinner was good, breakfast and lunch were disappointing.  Also, our stateroom attendant did a terrible job of cleaning our room.  There was dust everywhere, there was chocolate on the couch, and it was very obvious he barely took the time to clean the room.
5.0	Sail Date: May 09, 2015 /	great cruise, all staff went over and beyond, my husband hurt his back, and the dining room delivered 2 lobster dinners to him  that night, no complaints.
4.0	Sail Date: May 09, 2015 /	Excellent ship and service from staff onboard. Worse boarding experience in my 20+ cruises. No need for the way they handled the passengers waiting to board.
4.0	Sail Date: May 09, 2015 /	We took this cruise to celebrate our 45th anniversary and it was a great cruise in a very beautiful ship. The food was delicious, service was wonderful, and the entertainment was truly outstanding! The only complaint I have is that the huge size of the ship made it difficult for a person like me with foot problems to get from one area of the ship to another. By day 3 my feet were in bad shape. I need to stick with the smaller ships on future cruises.
5.0	Sail Date: May 02, 2015 /	This cruise was an excellent experience. My only complaints were small but never the less complaints. Guest services left a lot to be desired because I had to go to them twice about the same issue. The problem was finally resolved the second time. The comedy club venue was entirely to small for the number of guests going to the comedy show. People were turned around after  standing in line for 30 minutes. My final concern is a personal one. As a poker player playing in a cash game the slot tournament was next to the poker table with all the noise, bells and whistles causing a major distraction. Poker players don't want to have that kind of noise around them when playing.
3.0	Sail Date: May 02, 2015 /	After the first Island trip things seemed to work easier, but initially we were overwhelmed by not being able to talk to someone on board about our excursion and where we were to meet as we had never been on a cruise before this trip, and we were a little uncertain of the meeting location.
5.0	Sail Date: May 02, 2015 /	"This is the biggest ship in the world! The elegance is amazing. Everything from food to the entertainment shows were great; this ship is a city itself.

The only show my husband and I did not enjoy at all was the Broadway show, CATS. We fell asleep watching it and left during intermission to go lounge on the top deck in the pool.  

Nassau, Bahamas did not meet our expectations. St Thomas and St Maarten were spectacular!"
5.0	Sail Date: Apr 25, 2015 /	Dinning room service is excellent.  Food is very good, except soups were little salty. The only thing I didn't like was the picture taken during the dinner.  It would be better before the dinner start in the formal night (not casual nights).  Overall we enjoy the every meal in the main dinning.
5.0	Sail Date: Apr 25, 2015 /	Excellent service except the manager on Solarium. We arrived 5 minutes early to our reservation and asked my wife if everybody was present. We told him no and he said in rude manner that we call them that they are busy that night and pointed to the telephone. We were never treated an un welcoming manners in other dining rooms.
5.0	Sail Date: Apr 25, 2015 /	RC Oasis is a wonderful ship!! They treat you like royalty, everyone from the cabin attendant to the wait and bar staff!! The cleanliness is very impressive!! I can't believe there were 6,000 people on this ship because it never felt that crowded! Lots of things to do, or just lay around the pool!! This trip has spoiled us for any other ship at sea!! We highly recommend it!!
4.0	Sail Date: Apr 25, 2015 /	"Great experience and service. 

Food is great and wide selection but if it has more Asian choice and change a little bit in each day it would be much better. We found most of the breakfast serving the same. But overall is good, we love windjammer and solarium which is healthier food. 

Drinks and alcohol, we have to buy package with quite high price so we expect to have more variety for that. It should not have only soda because it is not suitable for health concern people, it should include lemonade, ice tea, etc...

Some shows not quite interested and boring like CATS, may be some more fun and popular shows would be better. But the great show that we love so much is acapella singer, this is very amazing. 

For shore excursion, we had wonderful trip in Haiti (cultural tour) and Cozumel (Xcaret) but not in Jamica (Dunn's river fall and plantation) because it took us more than 2 hour to sit in the bus back and fourth also we had lunch at 4pm which is too late. Before having lunch, staff at restaurant also trying hard to take photo of us. This is not nice. Actually shore excursion should include more details like how long for bus, how far for each place, etc....this all information is very important for us in making decision. We have no this information before we purchase."
4.0	Sail Date: Apr 25, 2015 /	My mom and I was very pleased with the staff and ship. We will be back on another Royal Caribbean Cruise. Compared to other cruise lines you guys were clean and the food was delicious.
5.0	Sail Date: Apr 25, 2015 /	This trip happened to be our honeymoon and it was fantastic!  The service we received from all of the staff was over and beyond!  Thank you for making our special trip even more special!!
4.0	Sail Date: Apr 18, 2015 /	"Overall, We enjoyed our first experience with RCL with a couple of exceptions(that later).
First, our main dining server made our dining experience exceptional. Always very attentive. Our Stateroom steward was also exceptional even though our first bad experience involved finding lipstick stain and hair on sheets the very first night. He immediately resolved the situation though and was always friendly and going out of his way to converse with us throughout the cruise.

Though a loyal 6-time Carnival cruiser, I was convinced(from friends) to try RCL and they would exceed my expectations and that I would never go back to ol' Carnival. I will admit, there WERE much more things to do on RCL than Carni. That being said, the few pluses onboard RCL are not enough to justify ousting Carni. RCL is about 40% more than Carni for same itinerary and there were a few things RCL fell short on.
1st, Insignificant but yet worth mentioning is RCL didn't provide detailed maps of ports of call. Only shopping maps of immediate port. Though, I did find the road maps at the port, I would have thought RCL would provide this. Again, no big deal.
2nd, I was completely disappointed in the reservation system for the shows onboard. Being, this was our first time aboard RCL, I did not know you must book ALL your shows on the first day. Some shows were so overbooked the 2nd day, we were unable to see them. I'm used to(as it should be) first come, first see for shows. Also, when you book one, you are unable to re-book for another day. We had booked one for 2nd day, but became ill so was unable to see. When we went to book another day, it said we had already booked this show and now not accepting any more reservations. This needs streamlined.


3rd, last day of cruise in main dining, I had mashed potatoes with main course. But something was added to potatoes upon a mouth full........some sort of plastic or saran wrap was embedded in mash potatoes. This is definitely unacceptable. I was told by Maitre d to report this to RCL but never got a response.
4th, Although plenty of daytime activities aboard(Zipline, flowrider, rock climbing, etc), hours of operation seemed very limited. Always seemed very busy during available times which made it hard to find a good time to access.
This is just a very good suggestion........when the comedy show is overbooked every night of the cruise, something needs to change. Once RCL realized this(as explained by the staff at Comedy Live), the venue should have been adopted to one of the bigger theaters to allow for the massive crowds that showed up. Due to the massive over booking, we were not able to see this show either.

RCL is a good quality cruise line but some tweaks are needed. Yeah, not everyone is going to be happy but I just don't see the big deal on switching to RCL from a better priced Carni. Carni just needs to up there game on available activities and hospitality.

I will say this, I loved  the Oasis of the Seas ship. So big, we were still finding shops/eateries 3 days in."
5.0	Sail Date: Apr 18, 2015 /	"We were on this ship last year to the Western Caribbean.  We liked it so much we decided to sail to the Eastern Caribbean on the same ship.  From beginning to end, the cruise line and the ship were excellent.

If you like shows, you can see one almost every night.  There is an island excursion for everyone's taste.  The food is excellent, the ship is clean, the entertainment is constant if you want it, or if you prefer quiet they have that, too.

We were constantly amazed at how friendly and helpful the staff was. 

This is an amazing ship and an amazing vacation."
5.0	Sail Date: Apr 18, 2015 /	It was great!!! Had a good time. Everyone was very nice. But I will not go thru . We were suppose to have $350.00 on line credit from  and when we called I think her name was Georgia said there was nothing she could do until Tuesday. Talk to Betty like she was a dog. Your customer service is lacking. I was in customer service for many years and this lady was trouble and I have told some of my friends not to book thru Crusiaes.com
2.0	Sail Date: Apr 18, 2015 /	"This was my first cruise on Royal Caribbean and it was not a good experience. I have cruised Carnival many times before and have been blown away by their service every time. Royal Caribbean's cruise is supposed to be even better, however, that was not the case. The entire crew seemed to have an attitude of ""we are inconveniencing them"" and were very combative and quick to tell you ""no."" I don't think it is too much to ask for my steak to be cooked medium well, however, we were told no, it has to be medium or medium rare. This is just one example of the many instances that occurred on the ship. Overall, the ship is gorgeous, but if for the money you pay to be on it, the service should equal the ships elegance."
5.0	Sail Date: Apr 18, 2015 /	Could not have asked for a better week!!! The ship was full and it didn't make a difference at all! No lines anywhere for anything. Food was awesome...we are the Buffet 5 nights and the main dining room twice just because it was that good....the lobster night was he best!!!!  One thing I did notice being a first time cruiser....he guest on the ship are just like me, regular people of all shapes and sizes. Everyone fits in and didn't meet a rude person the entire week!!! The staff on the ship were awesome, sometimes the language barrier was tough but never a issue on things!!! We will sail again!!
4.0	Sail Date: Apr 11, 2015 /	The Oasis Of The Seas is a destination of it self.The size had me a little concern before the cruise but after a day any concern was put to rest.From the  musical full production of CATS to the evenings piano and violin recital in Central Park the entertainment was best we experienced.This was our 25th cruise on over 12 different ships.Tthe food in the main dinning room was good to very good -the  buffet had a good veriety-the specialty dinning was ok with great service,food all over this ship.We booked a balcony over Central Park,Usually we stay in an ocean balcony not sure which one we would do .BOARDWALK was just ok great diving show and rock climbing wall.Always something going on the promenade deck. Enjoy this ship!
4.0	Sail Date: Apr 11, 2015 /	I won't take a mall balcony again . It was too noisy til late hours. Food was good and entertainment was fantastic. Ports of call mediocre but I understand the reasoning . The crew was very accomadating .
4.0	Sail Date: Apr 11, 2015 /	If you're into cruising, you should love this ship. Tastefully decorated and amazingly designed so it's easy to get around and you rarely sense the crowd that's onboard. The neighborhoods really work. Central Park is tranquil and inviting. There's always something to do on the Promenade, and plenty happening on the sports deck. Food was better than I've had on other cruises. So what's not to like? It's hard to find a quiet, private place. It seems there's always music playing somewhere - often annoyingly loud. There's way too much you have to pay for. One of the joys of cruising used to be having everything included. Maybe because we had a balcony on the Boardwalk, I tended to feel out of touch with the water. I've always loved working out with ocean views - the weight area is in a not very attractive interior area. Staff was great. The cabin felt small. We were a party of three, and it seems there should be a little more room than for a couple.
5.0	Sail Date: Apr 11, 2015 /	We have cruised with Carnival, Princess, and NCL but this was the best yet!  It's the biggest ship out there and we had always been curious about the experience.  Yes, it was crowded but there's so much to do we didn't mind that small inconvenience.  From the ice show to the Broadway production to the aqua high dive show to the comedy show the entertainment was great.  The carousel on board was fun even for us oldsters and the Boardwalk with the hot dog stand, Johnny Rockets, Starbucks, and Haagen Dazs was spot on.  The spa services excelled and our excursion in Jamaica (booked through Cruises Only) was affordable and of high quality.  I would highly recommend this line and ship - lots to do and you won't get bored even with 3 days at sea.
4.0	Sail Date: Apr 04, 2015 /	My family and I had a blast, definitely recommend. I still prefer Celebrity and Princess but it was great..I think alcohol was too pricey and they nickel and dime you for everything..The next time I vacation I think I will choose all inclusives. A better bang for your buck...
5.0	Sail Date: Apr 04, 2015 /	The cruise staff and entertainment were top notch. They left no stone unturned and all worked to make sure everything and everyone was well taken care of.  There was something for everyone from ice skating to ping pong, flow rider to dodge ball. The shows were plentiful and wonderfully executed. Bingo was hilarious and the hair salon personnel did not disappoint. Kudos to Tiago at the salon! He not only styled my hair beautifully but was very caring and informative when I needed it. Super kudos to my agent Chris Festerman.  After all the changes, additional room, late planning on my part, and the one million questions that I asked, he still made sure that I  wasn't living in the belly of the beast feeling the waves on the bottom of the ship.  I had a great view and a warm greeting from him when I  arrived in my stateroom.   Chris you are the best!!!!! I will tell all my friends and family about your great service and Patience.😇, and the time and care perfecting your service for others.  I felt like I was talking to a friend.
5.0	Sail Date: Apr 04, 2015 /	Yes!!! The ship, the crew, the experience, the best VACA I've had in a long time. There is so many good points about the Royal Caribbean's Oasis of the Seas. You want to bring your kids along and you want a day or two for yourselves sign them up fo the kids adventure piece all included. They will take them on scavenger hunts, play various games and even take them to see a movie all on the ship.Seven days is a must just to see all the ship has to offer, various clubs and bars resurants (some all enclusive) and the nice stroll down Central Park,the Cats brodway production and the Oasis of dreams aqutic show. So much more you just have to go and see for yourself.

4.0	Sail Date: Mar 28, 2015 /	This is the nicest ship that I've ever been on.  The room was great and the balcony is a must!  The crowd was older than I would have liked and the night life is extremely weak.  The casino seems to be the only place with people after 1130pm.  Overall, the stops were nice and the ship is beautiful.  The food was much better than any other ship I've been on as well.  The formal dining room is great and the specialty restaurants are overpriced and not worth it.  Next time I would do the Eastern Carribean trip as the beaches and stops are nicer.  Also,  watch your tab in Labadee Haiti.  RC allows waiters to make bogus charges to your room without pairing room numbers with names or sailcards.  When you get a credit from guest services, the computer automaticly posts it to your account again hoping that you don't notice.  Why RC allows room charges to be made to rooms with only a room # and no other proof is beyond me...
4.0	Sail Date: Mar 21, 2015 /	"Great Cruise Ship - Lots of people but never felt crowded. Shows are good makes sure you reserve the comedy clubs as soon as you can as space is limited and this is very popular. Chops was the best specialty restaurant. If you want to relax and have fun this is the cruise for you.

Get a balcony ocean view - worth every dollar, we had room 14650 - Deck 14 - what a voew"
2.0	Sail Date: Mar 21, 2015 /	This was my second cruise on Royal Caribbean, I have previously sailed many times on Carnival and NCL.  I was super excited to sail on the most talked about ship in the world.  Was totally disappointed, the food was ok... everything tasted the same, bland.  We had two cabins (Inside and a Balcony) both were nice and clean.  Was sad to see that the employees never looked happy to be working there.  Elevator wait everyday was a minimum of a 10 minute wait.  My teenagers 15 & 18 did not enjoy the teen group as much as they have on other cruise lines (Did not offer many things for them to do).  The aqua show was good but the comedy & Cats show was horrible.  They didn't play any tropical music on sea days until 1:30pm?  I found it to be very boring and not lively. We had dinner at Chops Steakhouse, the food was good but was ruined by the staff deciding to clean the kitchen with chemicals and blowers and the stench blowing into the dining room right where we were seated. Central Park was a nice feature on the ship and so was the Park Café.  It  was a great place to eat breakfast & lunch.  Windjammers was horrible for breakfast they offered Chinese food every morning which made no sense? food was greasy and non appealing.  Sorrento's on previous ships offered more selections other than just pizza but the Oasis it was just pizza.  We were almost turned away from an empty specialty restaurant because we didn't make reservations at Izumi? we previously called and they said we could walk in for lunch.  When we arrived they only had 3 diners and 10 empty tables? The greeter told us sorry but we are completely booked and I told him it doesn't look like it? and he said well our 1pm never showed so I guess we can give you their table?  (Mind you this is a specialty restaurant not free) Thank God the sushi was delicious.  The icing on the cake was debarkation... We had our breakfast at 8am and were rushed out of the Windjammers by 8:30am?? We had to go to our waiting areas to debark.  The lines were ridiculous we were ushered around like mass cattle.  Thank God we are Crown & Anchor members (so I thought)  you get to wait in the theatre with seats and continental breakfast and when you number is called you can debark. Well that's not what happened, when they called our number we had to go to the back of the line that was now double as long?? What was benefit of the special wait area? totally ineffective.  We saw parents with small children and infants standing online for hours with us.  They should have been able to debark earlier.  This will definitely be our last cruise with Royal Caribbean not worth the hype.
5.0	Sail Date: Mar 14, 2015 /	My family of four just returned from a 7 nt. cruise on Oasis during the week of spring break.  The ship is HUGE with tons of different stuff to do.  The entertainment was the best of any cruise we've been on.  The ship was beautiful.  The staff was excellent!  Very friendly and committed to making sure you had a great trip.  My only criticisms were that there we so many kids on the ship that all the kid-related activities were difficult to access.  I know that much of this is due to when we cruised.  We would definitely cruise on this RC ship again!
5.0	Sail Date: Mar 07, 2015 /	"We had a great time on our Oasis of the Seas Eastern Caribbean cruise. We were worried that the ship would be crowded for our spring break sailing. Not so. The way the ship is designed, you can be as quiet and solitary or loud and in a crowd as you please.  We were impresesd with our Family Stateroom that had two bunk beds, a pull out sofa and a king size bed. There was plenty of room for our two teens and we weren't cramped with all four of us in a room.  

The food...oh where to start? We really enjoyed the food on board. We purposefully didn't want a schedule or a set time to dine, we wanted to go with the flow of the day. We ate most dinners at Windjammer and the food was delicious. Plenty of options for whatever you were in the mood to eat.  We ate at Silk with My Time Dining reservations twice- it was great, too. My husband spotted a filet mignon on the menu that included an upcharge and stated it was from Chops Grille. It was certainly cheaper than eating at Chops Grille and was cooked to perfection. I enjoyed ordering 4 appetizers one night, instead of the standard fare. The wait staff were friendly, always helpful and smiling and even when the lines were long- they kept a great attitude.  

Since we didn't have a list of reservations booked ahead of time, we happened to speak with someone at the reservation desk at Silk. They commented that we hadn't eaten at any of the specialty restaurants,  we explained we were going for relaxation and not too structured of a schedule. He offered reservations at the Solarium Cafe for dinner at no charge for 7 people.  We took him up on the offer and really enjoyed the food at Solarium.  The ambiance there was very relaxed and it wasn't crowded at all. I think they were trying to off-load some patrons from the busier restaurants for the at-sea days, but it worked in our favor. 

We spent most of our time in the Solarium area- it is peaceful, relaxing and there are plenty of spots to be in the sun or stay out of the sun. Great place to curl up with a good book and the Solarium Bistro is just steps away to grab a snack or lunch.  

Our kids really enjoyed the teen program. There were plenty of 'cool' activities for them to do and it was organized very well.  Dinners, dances, dodgeball tournaments, air hockey, ice skating, Flow Rider sessions for teens only, on and on.  I think they enjoyed the freedom to roam on the ship, along with all of the activities, too!

We were overwhelmed by the drink package choices and in hindsight, could have gotten away with just purchasing the kids the Royal Refreshment package.  We don't drink much soda, but we do like juices, flavored sparkling water, and frozen drinks. We aren't big drinkers and purchased wine/beer by the glass at dinner, which worked out well to forego the all included alcohol package.  It took us a few days to uncover where the Coca Cola FreeStyle machines were hiding- there are two in the Windjammer Cafe and two by Sorrento's. We liked the Dasani Sparkling Raspberry water option, but quickly discovered the Windjammer and Solarium Bistro have a low calorie flavored water (Strawberry and Mango) that were refreshing. 

We LOVED the Oasis aqua show, the ventriloquist and the bands at Bolero.  The people watching just sitting in the main promenade area was priceless.  We couldn't believe we were on a cruise ship while strolling through Central Park one evening, they've piped in sounds of crickets and if you didn't know it, you would think you were in a random park.  

We had a great experience and will definitely be back."
4.0	Sail Date: Mar 07, 2015 /	"Overall, a good experience. There were some rough spots though. On boarding day, we boarded at the time they recommended -- and could not find any food available! The Windjammer was closed, as were all the other food venues. We went from floor to floor (6 of us) and could not find any venues open, nor was it easy to find out what was open. Others we encountered had similar experiences. 2 in our party are diabetic, so we resorted to the slightly smashed protein bars we had in our purses for emergencies. We were told that the Windjammer would be open when we boarded.

The Aqua Show was amazing. Loved it.

Cats: Meh. Too long, seemed pointless.

Comedians: Good! We went to both the ""adult"" show and the ""family show."" Both good.

We loved the ""Morning Show"" on the TV, with Drew Devine, the Cruise Director. He was very funny, and we made a point to watch it every day. Ha!"

Only thing was that you have to buy your beverage package.  Water is the only thing free and juice in the morning.

CATS MUSICAL IS A HIT, AND CENTRAL PARK IS SO RELAXING ESPECIALLY IF YOU LIKE READING. MY DISLIKE ABOUT MY CRUISE: IT IS A MONEY SHIP. EVERYONE WE MET SAID THE SAME THING WE WAS THINKING. TO ADD INSULT TO INJURY, WE PREPAID OUR GRATUITIES, BUT AT THE END OF OUR CRUISE AN ENVELOPE WAS LEFT FOR EXTRA GRATUITIES. I HAD TO ASK THE PORTER TO CLEAN THE BATHROOM. THERE WAS HAIR IN THE SHOWER ON THE FIRST DAY, AND THEN I NOTICED FOR FOUR DAYS THE SAME TRASH WAS ON THE BATROOM FLOOR.

4.0	Sail Date: Feb 14, 2015 /	The entertainment was the best of any cruise.  The flow riders are always full with kids.  I'd like to see an adults only time slot.  There's a fee to use the steam room as part of the spa so we passed on that.  Only had one questionable dining experience because the lobster tails were overcooked.  The Sonora Mexican restaurant is no longer free.  That was a surprise.  Although not publicized RCC allows you take 2 750 ml wine bottles on board which fit nicely into the fridge.  We recommend avoiding the buffet and always eat in the dining room on 3 or at the Central Park café.  The layout was great where you didn't have to walk through the casino.
5.0	Sail Date: Feb 14, 2015 /	"I should be able to give some constructive criticism, but I can't.  Great food, entertainment and personal attention.  Wind blew a bit, but not your fault.  Our room was cleaned 3-4 times a day, and was spotless.  The food was as good as money can buy anywhere.  The staff were all attentive and friendly.

I recommend Royal Caribbean without reservation."
5.0	Sail Date: Feb 14, 2015 /	Great service in the suite  lounge and coastal kitchen. (Mary) the bartender made you feel like home. Servers were great. Room was absolutely fabulous. Our room steward was the best. Shows were absolutely wonderful.
5.0	Sail Date: Feb 14, 2015 /	"This was our fifth cruise and third RC cruise .  The ship was everything promised.  Very impressed with the interior of the ship. RC did an excellent job  planning areas of the ship exclusively for different age groups.   One of my biggest complaints on a cruise is that any relaxation time is marred by teenagers and younger people being loud and partying.  I was one of those years ago but now want to be able to get in a hot tub without them.  Love solarium and spent most of my down time there.  Enjoyed getting in my five miles every morning on the 5th deck track.  Service was superb. The entertainment, when we could get a seat was world class.  Much better than other cruises.

Things to improve on. Desserts.  I love to indulge in a good decadent dessert. I understand making small hand held desserts in windjammer but it would have been nice just once to have a truly memorable dessert in the dining room.  Having a bakery where you could buy specially made desserts would be great.  

Classes- In the past classes were a part of every cruise and did not cost extra.  $25.00 to learn how to decorate cupcakes????

Making reservations for the shows was a pain.  I was not told to do so before hand so I had to stand in line to get left over seats.  Im assuming the large number of passengers made that necessary.

Over all the ship, the entertainment, the activities were fantastic.  It was like living in fantasy land for a week.  Now Im sitting here in SC looking out at the snow dreaming of Jamaica."
3.0	Sail Date: Feb 14, 2015 /	"The ship was beautiful, better than I could have expected. For as many people as were on the ship the only time we felt crowded was on sea days at the buffet for breakfast. All other times were not an issue. Service all around was average, not bad but not what we are used to getting on Princess Cruise Line.  Shows were ok, was disappointed because the reviews made it sound like they were awesome. The ice skating show was the only impressive one. Nightly entertainment in the pub was fantastic, we listened to a solo guitarist/singer named Aaron Copple, he was very entertaining and enjoyable to listen to every night. He will be on the ship till the end of May, i do recommend stopped at the Pub on and listening, he starts around 9:30 and goes till 12:30-1am. Boarding and disembarkation was to be expected. No lines to get off boat at any port. Food wasn't bad but wasn't outstanding. All we heard on the ship and in the mailings was talking about the Royal Caribbean ""WOW"", but we never experienced that. Too bad, missed opportunity with such a nice ship. All in all not bad but not better than princess which was what was what we were told."
3.0	Sail Date: Feb 14, 2015 /	"The ship was amazing but the service and food was not there....

No pool area for adults only, no food included when we took an excursion at the dunns river falls....it was very cheap....

For the same price you should try Celebrity concierge class instead."
5.0	Sail Date: Feb 14, 2015 /	This ship was absolutely beautiful. We traveled with two teenagers(16 years old) and they had a blast, we hardly saw them the whole trip. There are a variety activities happening every minute, and all day long. The food was amazing and so was the service throughout the entire ship!! We have cruised on Royal Caribbean four other times and we have already booked another cruise for next February 2016 right on the ship. They offer great incentives and on board credits!!
5.0	Sail Date: Feb 07, 2015 /	The Oasis of the Seas and it's sister ship, the Allure, are our favorite ships. We've bnoth been on over 1oo cruises, which gives us a good means of comparison. We particularly like the concierge lounge and the shoes.
5.0	Sail Date: Feb 07, 2015 /	"Beautiful ship great service great shoes really didn't like cats the dining room

Service was excellent! Kenroy did a great job. The hot dog was great too!"
5.0	Sail Date: Feb 07, 2015 /	The Oasis of the Seas is an awesome ship!!!!!!!!!!! RCL really makes the cruise a great experience. Very easy to board & just as quick to leave the ship. Plus so much to do while on the Oasis. The only thing I was less than 100% on was the Chop's Restaurant. Everyone's meal was good (I had the $19 extra porterhouse) but it was just not worth the extra charge ($35 each). I expected more choices. The dessert choices were very limited as were the vegetable selections.
5.0	Sail Date: Jan 31, 2015 /	The Oasis is a huge ship but still very manageable. Crew was extremely courteous and friendly. We really enjoyed My Time dining. food was  generally  excellent. Service was  superior in the dining rooms. Entertainment was  great. The high diving and sync swimming show was fantastic. We have been on 50 cruises and this was in the top 5%.
4.0	Sail Date: Jan 31, 2015 /	I loved all the interesting features of the ship and I am happy I did it at least once.  Would I go on her again, probably not.  I enjoy the smaller ships you can get closer to the people you are sailing with.  The itenaries were excellent.  With that being said I believe a true cruiser should at least try it once.  Most of the staff was wonderful .  The only time was at the casino.  I had a waiter take my coffee away and told me to buy drinks and I stil was playing and my husbands' soda package they refused to fill at the bar.  I complained to guest services.
3.0	Sail Date: Jan 31, 2015 /	We did have issues with my husbands sail and sign card, several times.  We spent several hours of our vacation at guest services, which ended up turning into a big inconvenience after the 3rd time.  I also had expectations of music being played on the deck by the pool, and there wasn't any music playing any day. The ship is beautiful, the Waite staff and room attendants are very good.
3.0	Sail Date: Jan 31, 2015 /	"WE WERE EXCITED TO TRY OUT OASIS AFTER DOING A DISNEY CRUISE A FEW YEARS EARLIER.  IT WAS AN AMAZING SHIP. HOWEVER, WE WERE TRAVELING WITH YOUNG KIDS AND FELT A FEW ACCOMMODATIONS WERE MADE FOR FAMILIES, BUT THE MAIN TARGET FOR ACTIVITIES AND FEATURES WERE FOR WEALTHY RETIREES. IT HAD A SMALL KIDS CLUB THAT WAS MEAGERLY STAFFED AND ONLY OPEN FOR A FEW HOURS AT A TIME.  YOU ACTUALLY HAD TO PAY TO USE IT AFTER 7PM! WHEREAS, ON OUR DISNEY CRUISE, THE COMPLIMENTARY KIDS CLUB WAS HUGE AND OPEN FROM 8AM-MIDNIGHT EVERYDAY WITH A RATIO OF 1 STAFF MEMBER FOR EVERY 2 KIDS.

THE GREAT AMOUNT OF PEOPLE ON THE SHIP MADE ITSELF KEENLY KNOWN IN LINES AND STANDING ROOM ONLY FOR MOST ENTERTAINMENT/DINNING VENUES. THE SHOWS AND ENTERTAINMENT WERE TOP NOTCH, BUT IF YOU WEREN'T 30 MINS. EARLY, YOU COULD NOT FIND A SEAT. THE ONLY TIME WE DID NOT HAVE A PROBLEM WAITING IN A LONG LINE TO EAT FOR ""ANYTIME DINNING"" WAS RIGHT AT 5PM WHEN THE RESTAURANT OPENED. TABLES WERE ALWAYS STICKY, DUE TO QUICK WIPING TO MAKE ROOM FOR THE CONSTANT STREAMS OF PEOPLE GOING IN AND OUT OF THE BUFFET. WITH SUCH LARGE QUANTITIES, QUALITY TOOK A SECOND SEAT.

IT WAS ALSO DISAPPOINTING TO FIND OUT THE AMOUNT OF RESTAURANTS YOU HAD TO PAY TO EAT AT FAR EXCEEDED THE COMPLIMENTARY ONES.

THE ACTIVITIES SCHEDULE WAS POORLY PLANNED OUT. FOR EXAMPLE: FORMAL NIGHT WAS THE SAME NIGHT AS THE SUPERBOWL, SO WE HAD TO MAKE THE CHOICE OF DRESSING UP TO EAT A NICE MEAL OR DRESS DOWN AND STARVING (OR PAYING $2 FOR A BAG OF POPCORN) TO WATCH THE SUPERBOWL! ALSO, MEET AND GREET THE MADAGASCAR PENGUINS WAS SCHEDULED FOR THE SAME TIME AS WHEN THEIR MOVIE WAS SHOWING!

OVERALL, WE HAD SOME FUN, BUT IF WE CHOOSE TO CRUISE AGAIN WITH OUR FAMILY, IT WILL BE ON A DISNEY CRUISE."
3.0	Sail Date: Jan 24, 2015 /	The Oasis is a beautiful ship with tremendous entertainment. The cleanliness of the ship left a little to be desired. I witnessed a crew menber kick a grape into the walk way and went into his crew entrance. It would have been different if he walked over it and did not see it. But to deliberately kick it into the path of people travelling in and out of the solarium.. unacceptable. There was also a lot of dirty dishes and trash left on tables for way too long. Other cruises I have been on, the staff constantly walked around clearing and wiping tables. If that is how they clean what we can see, how are the areas we cannot see?
3.0	Sail Date: Jan 24, 2015 /	"Service on board from the staff was wonderful Entertainment was fairly good ... However the drink prices, pictures and some of the package excursions were overly priced considering the price of the cruise also the limitation of what was offered to eat late nights were very limited to what they used to be just a couple of years ago! This has been my 20th cruise with Royal Caribbean and I'm sorry to say this might be my last with you.

5.0	Sail Date: Jan 24, 2015 /	"This was our second voyage on the Oasis.  Both times the embarkation and disembarkation were super quick - quicker than any other ship we've ever been on.  We were so ""wowed"" on the first trip that we were afraid that our expectations might be slightly disappointing on this trip, but they weren't.  We were a group of eight and had to do ""My Time"" dining as we couldn't get all of us on the early seating (our first negative).  HOWEVER, we sat at the same table with the same waiters each night so it was great!  They were attentive and top notch in their service.  The food was better than our first time on the ship.  The second negative (and I'm not sure there's a reasonable fix for this) was in the Windjammer Café on the day of embarkation.  We got to the Café around 12:35 and we could not find a table anywhere.  We walked around for over 15 minutes before we found one table for 4.  They kept announcing for folks to please leave their table once they were through eating, but no one did.  They were just sitting around waiting for the cabins to be ready (which was 1 p.m.) .  Shortly after 1 there was an abundance of tables.  We tried all of the complimentary restaurants and they were just as good as we remembered.  The third minor negative was in the show CATS.  Their performance was top notch.  I had seen the Broadway version and a fellow traveler saw it in London and we both felt it was better than what we had previously seen.  The negative was that we had it booked for an evening show and it somehow got cancelled and we had to see it on the afternoon of the last day of the cruise.  It just doesn't have the same feel in the afternoon as it does at night and the theater was probably 50% full - which says something about the timing.  Even though their performance of CATS was excellent, I didn't think it was the right production for a cruise ship.   I think many agreed in that probably half of the people in attendance left at intermission.   We saw ""Hairspray"" on our last sailing which was light and funny.  CATS is neither of these.  There are plenty of ""happy"" musicals that could have been picked before CATS.  The rest of the shows were phenomenal and they set the bar really high for other cruise ships' entertainment.  The crew on the ship are among the friendliest we've ever encountered.  Everyone spoke to you.  The final negative was in the casino.  My husband played the slots and they were not at all fun.  He spoke to a lot of other players and they all agreed.  The ship itself is an amazing experience just to walk through and it is easy quickly learn the layout. Walking down the promenade was like walking through a mall.  As you walk through Central Park, you have to keep reminding yourself that you're on a ship. The live plants and trees are beautifully arranged and at night, it's just wonderful to stroll through the park.  And the Boardwalk is much smaller, but cute.  We rode the carousel one night which was fun - mainly because we were at sea!  Johnny Rockets is open for breakfast and it's complimentary.  It was never crowded and you can eat inside or outside.  If you eat outside, you can watch the zip liners overhead and if you don't watch, you can certainly hear some of them.  We did play miniature golf and my husband did the rock climbing.  We never got to ice skate as we were too busy with other things and decided to skate on the last day at sea but didn't find out until we read our activities for the last day that they weren't going to offer it.  By then all of the skating sessions had closed.  That was kind of a bummer.  The parades are fun to watch and even though we didn't have any children on the cruise, there was plenty of things on the ship geared to them.  It was the first time for the other six travelers in our group to sail on the Oasis and they were as awed as we were the first time we sailed on it.  We've already said we'll do it again! Royal Caribbean's ads now show a ""WOW"" experience and the Oasis is just that - ""WOW""!"
5.0	Sail Date: Jan 24, 2015 /	"Most things were as expected. Which is great. We did miss the chocolate on the pillows. Also noted not as much pushing of drinks, which is fine for us. Also noticed more plates, glasses etc being around for a fair while before getting picked up. 

This was our first really big ship with Royal. We liked the reservation for the big shows. Cats and Frozen in Time were wonderful. 

Wish the weather was nicer, but that is not under anyone's control.

This is John not Patricia"
2.0	Sail Date: Jan 10, 2015 /	"It was exciting to think about cruising on the largest ship in the world (though I think that means passenger ship, but not sure).  Anyway, bigger is fine, but not necessarily better.  The shows were decent, except for Cats which was terrible.  The service was good and what you would normally expect.  The food was less than average and hard to find a place open many times of the day.  Maybe it was the time of the year, but many of the passengers were old and cranky.  This rudeness was hard to overcome many days. 

Of course, like most things in life, it is what you make of it.  The lack of quality of food prevented me from gaining weight, so I guess I should thank them.  The ports were as to be expected and the weather was very nice.  My wife and I hadn't gotten away on a trip for just the two of us in years, so we danced and laughed and had a great time!  Several folks mentioned they really like Princes so we may try them next time or a luxury cruise with Crystal.  We avoided the luxury cruise because of the price, but after all the add-ons with RC, it wouldn't have been that much more with Crystal.  Internet $200, Specialty dining $15-$30 per person, per night, $10 cocktails (or unlimited for $880), several parts of he ship where us steerage folks weren't allowed to go (a bit like being Irish on the Titanic down below the gates haha), Photos for $15 each, and it just went on and on.  Okay, I've gone negative again, so I'll stop there.  Just set your expectations low and budget high and you'll be fine.  Make the best of it. 

Book your shows and excursions at least 7 days before you depart or you won't get to see or do much."
3.0	Sail Date: Jan 10, 2015 /	Overall I enjoyed the cruise, but I prefer smaller ships with more individual attention.  The night club entertainment was a bit of a disappointment.  So much of it was geared to the young adults.  The entertainment geared to dancing that was available for the mature adults, did not last long enough with too many breaks.
5.0	Sail Date: Jan 10, 2015 /	This ship is fantastic!   Loved our balcony room and our stateroom attendant, Antoinia, was amazing.   The food was great and we loved all the options.    We also loved being able to go for a walk on the track around the ship after our dinner!    The shows were great and especially loved the comedians, ice skating show and come fly with me.    We played a little in the casino and besides the smoking in there, enjoyed that as well.   There is great shopping on board and so many places to see that it is amazing that we did not see it all in our week stay.   We took the ferry over to St. Johns, USVI from St. Thomas and recommend doing that.   (get over there as quick as possible since it takes a little time to go back and forth.   Trunk Bay is a fun place to relax, swim, snorkel.....   Loved it.
3.0	Sail Date: Jan 03, 2015 /	"This ship feels like a small city floating on the sea. There were pros and cons to our experience. 

Pros: Staterooms were spacious and clean; Ship was beautifully crafted with smart use of space; loved the spa & solarium area; ice skating show was the best entertainment we've seen on any ship; fantastic entertainment venues.

Cons: Crew seemed overworked and rude; crew responded negatively to prepaid drink cards; my time dining delivered a poor table and indifferent wait staff; food was average unless you paid extra for the specialty restaurants; outside of the ice skating show & comedy club the other shows were poor."
4.0	Sail Date: Dec 20, 2014 /	Everything was excellent.  Did not love My Time Dining.  Seemed a bit unorganized.  Shows were fabulous except Cats.  Steak restaurant delicious.  Would like a different itinerary on same boat.  Already did eastern and western caribbean.
5.0	Sail Date: Dec 20, 2014 /	Ship was beautiful, had many options, did not feel crowded, easy to get on and off.  Very hit or miss with the food.  Some menu items were excellent, others were bad mostly because of poor preparation (not poor quality). Could just order something else if the first option was bad.   No 24 hour food options other than room service.  Venues advertised as 24 hour actually closed at 3:00 am.  Could of had more music (live or canned) poolside.  Cats musical was too long for a cruise ship performance but very well done.  Other shows were excellent as well.  Would have liked a switch of comedians halfway through the cruise as was the case on another cruise. Refreshing that I was not pressured to buy drinks or additional services as was the case on previous cruises.  Very international vibe.  At least a third of the guests were not from the US.
3.0	Sail Date: Dec 20, 2014 /	"2nd time sailing on the Oasis. Wonderful ship. I was fortunate to sail on her during the first year of service. She's starting to show her age. The beds mattresses are in desperate need of updating. 

Menu's in Silk are very predictable with only a couple of menu items changing from night to night.

Windjammer staff was very small and not helpful, breakfast was a chaotic nightmare. Royal has really cut back on deck staff, as finding a drink was incredibly hard.

The ship has added new stores, but with this said, the sacrifice was evident as I could never find the Crown & Anchor Society desk. I even asked 7 crew members, they didn't know...

These are minor items, the Oasis is still my favorite ship...

Onward and Upward, the next cruise I have Diamonds in my eyes:-)"
4.0	Sail Date: Dec 13, 2014 /	Gorgeous ship, we love the Central Park. The specialty restaurant are outstanding. The crews were great. Reyly and partner at the Silk dining, Elmer of the Chops Grille and the bartender Bailey in Central Park, room attendant helped made our vacation memorable.
5.0	Sail Date: Dec 13, 2014 /	"The ship is beautiful, lots of activities, GREAT shows (saw full Broadway production of ""CATS""! WONDERFUL!!); well maintained w/ an excellent and very hard working crew.  Loved the food, the rest and relaxation. Each time we cruise, we learn new stuff.  Should have listened to Joseph Parks, our ""Cruise Guru"" and committed to a seating but things still worked out well.  Next time we will also sign up for our excursions WHEN we book the cruise (couldn't do a few that we really wanted to do because they were ALL booked up!).  All in all, will be watching for more great deals in the future from Royal Caribbean.  The OASIS of the Seas convinced us that cruising is the ideal vacation for US.  Thanks again."
5.0	Sail Date: Dec 13, 2014 /	the cruise, the staff [except for one], the entertainment, the food and everything else was the best. all the people we met and teamed up with was party to making the cruise wonderful. the diamomd lounge was our meeting place and eddie [diamond lounge manager] made our daily meetings even better. so once again to the staff, crew, guest and everyone else THANK YOU
4.0	Sail Date: Dec 06, 2014 /	Our boarding experience was not too comfortable. Many people got tired & hungry because of the size of the crowds checking in & were waiting for restaurants to eat. Most restaurants were very full & elevators were packed with people.
4.0	Sail Date: Dec 06, 2014 /	Really the ultimate of cruising that we have done so far. If I had any criticism it would be destinations we have been on this ship 3 times tired of these stops. Cats was amazing but too long, I  think most people felt that way. Those two issues aside it was elegant, entertaining, great service, Love the spa, the fitness center, central park was so peaceful,  we really did not have a bad meal. Our group really enjoyed the week!
5.0	Sail Date: Dec 06, 2014 /	This is a huge ship that has everything that you would want.  The restaurant selection is so varied that even the most picky eaters can find something that they will like and enjoy. Activities are non-stop and the crew are all gracious and helpful.
4.0	Sail Date: Dec 06, 2014 /	"Over all was a very good cruise. The staf was great. We thought our room nice but would have been better if was higher. Most shows we attendant were great but didn't like ""cats"". Did care fo mytime dining  to many people to close together settings, could not visit with other table guests because of noise. Again it was a very good cruise."
5.0	Sail Date: Dec 06, 2014 /	We had a great time on Oasis of the Seas.  It was our first time sailing on a large ship and what an experience. The ship is awesome, you don't even realize that you're on a ship most of the time.  The staff is fantastic, always very friendly and willing to help with anything you need.  The Cruise Director Ricky, made the trip even more memorable.  He was so lively and very entertaining.  If you have an opportunity to go, you won't be disappointed.  We can't wait to go back!!
5.0	Sail Date: Dec 06, 2014 /	I'd highly recommend the Oasis for those with little ones.  The nursery staff were really great with our daughter.  The ship is very accommodating for families.  The ship also has a lot to do but if you want to keep it simple you can do that too.
5.0	Sail Date: Nov 29, 2014 /	"Oh My! From the first step in to the foyer of our suite we knew it was going to be a ""Sweet"" experience!

Our stateroom attendant was very friendly and accommodating, and very attentive especially to Nana, my Mother-in-law (90yrs) who stayed in room a lot just reading or sleeping. Roshan Boodhooa is perfect match for suite comforts.

The wraparound Deck was awesome but too windy to relax on this particular cruise. I actually slipped and fell because the deck was wet and the wind was howling. Luckily, I'm pretty fit and could pick myself up. We did get to see the aqua show twice (the last three shows were cancelled due to weather.) It was so fantastic! The belly flop contest was lots of fun especially from our deck! Had great fun watching the wall climbers.

Dining experience was not our best. 8:30pm American Icon. Everything seemed to be coming out at same time and many things never did arrive...ice tea, asparagus...gluten-free rolls (offered). Entrees just ok. Went with our kids to their "" my time "" dining in Silk and the service and ambiance were superb! Dining in Chops is always the ultimate experience for us! We reserved 2 nights with all five of us and although it cost us well over $400.00 a night even with 2 free covers one night. Chops experience is always a five star experience! Sorrento's gluten-free pizza was great and will be a bonus next time we bring my son who has celiac. Johnny Rockets is always a fun and tasty experience. All 5 of us went for those burgers twice!

We really didn't get much time with the concierge perks in the Coastal Kitchen because they would not allow our children (in their 40's) to join us at all. I asked if my daughter could just sit with me and wait for our dinner reservations and they just said a flat ""No!""  Next time, and there will be that, I will get it for all 7 family members. This time I needed a separate bath for my mother-in-law and so I put our kids down the hall so they had own space. I asked to pay for them to join us in concierge lounge but I got a ""No!"" once again. The fruit plate was refreshing.

Next time we will all be in the suite and we will most likely abuse the concierge lounge because that is what we do best....""lounge around and share experiences""!"
5.0	Sail Date: Nov 29, 2014 /	the only things that I didn't like about this cruise was you needed to reserve every entertainment you wanted to do on your trip before you left home.  We missed quite a bit of different shows we wanted to see but they were all booked. Another thing was instead of having a show  in one of the larger theater so more people could see them, they put it in a small room where we were so crowded that people were going in the hallway to get seats and putting them all over the place blocking the exit door to the club.  My sister who is 67 almost got into a fight because she was seated then people would just come in the room then stand right in front of her and she couldn't see.  We had come in early for a seat but it was just so crowded in the small show rooms, especially the On Air bar.
3.0	Sail Date: Nov 29, 2014 /	"Boarding was quick and easy.   I would say it took less than 10  minutes from parking lot to ship.   Way better than other cruises we have been on.   As for the ship - it was really so nice and had an amazing amount of entertainment.   The choices seemed endless of things to do and the shows we were able to see were really very good and we typically walk out of all cruise shows within five minutes (although the particular headliner show we walked out of).   We were unable to see the aqua shows as we had rough seas most of the week so they were unable to perform but we heard it was amazing.   We had a great time in the adult show in Studio B.  It was hilarious.   The 70's dance show in the promenade was so fun and I can't say enough about the Cruise Director, Ricky, he was awesome.  What wasn't so awesome was the food..... BLECH.  And I really mean BLECH.  My thin husband likely lost weight as he just simply decided by the fourth day that there wasn't anything on the boat worth eating and it was always cold..    Even the lobster was severely overcooked and cold and they either gave us fake butter for the lobster or the lobsters tasted horrible?   We even at a specialty restaurant (Serenity) and it wasn't much better.  Carnival's Burger Joint (by Guy Fieri) and their burrito bar so far blow the Oasis food out of the water.   Anyway, we have always said that ""it is hard to mess up breakfast"" but even it was horrible. The last morning we ate in the dining room as I had to eat fried eggs every morning as all other eggs were powdered, the waffles were cold, soggy rubbery things that were absolutely inedible and so on.   But to my surprise even the dining room served powdered eggs and cold hash browns that looked like the ones at McDonald's  and the bacon was pure fat.   I pushed the plate away once again and ate rolls/toast for yet another meal.   I ate so much bread and I try never to eat it but it was some of the only edible stuff we found (with the exception of the Park Café salad and roast beef sandwich (which got boring fast)   Some people on the ship said that the food was what they expected and some fully agreed with us that it was horrible but I didn't hear anyone say once that it was good.   One gentleman was so disgusted that he said he was giving up on RC and he was a diamond platinum member or something of the sort as he thought all the food was horrible to the point as he called it ""mystery food"".    With all this said.....I think the actual ship and entertainment/sports were so good they ruined us for other ships but the food was so inedible that we can't go again.   Quite a quandary.

Oh.....  and as everyone says....  be prepared to wait in line.   And then wait in more lines.   You really need to make reservations for the main shows and then still get there more than 15 minutes early or they let the stand-by line in.   If you want a good seat.... be prepared to wait 45 or more minutes.    You even have to make reservations for ""My Time Dining"".   Doesn't that sound counter intuitive?  Or is it just me?   If you don't make the reservations for My Time Dining... be prepared to wait an hour or more.

I can say that from what we experienced, the staff and crew were nothing but friendly and helpful and never once had an issue at any time."

4.0	Sail Date: Nov 29, 2014 /	Overall, the cruise on Oasis was excellent.  The ship did seem crowded at times, but the shows were great and the crew was brilliant.  Having done both the Allure and Oasis now - I would lean toward medium sized ships in the future.
5.0	Sail Date: Nov 22, 2014 /	amazing food. Tons to do for everyone. Clean and loved it! The shows were good. We went skating, zip lining, played miniature golf, and road the wave. The frozen yogurt was good and we loved all the pools and the hot tubs.
3.0	Sail Date: Nov 22, 2014 /	"Very first cruise, but not exactly what I expected.  I was very impressed with the size and cleanliness of the ship.  The staff were very friendly, courteous and helpful.  The downsides for us were: (1) we expected more family-oriented activities.  It seemed the activities were geared towards kids in the clubs and activities for grown-ups separately; (2) we were charged $12.00 per day per person in the stateroom for gratuities (three of us).  We weren't sure if this could be changed in any way, but it seemed a hidden cost.  We would have liked to tip our service providers ourselves based on how we ranked their service; (3) there was no iron or laundry facilities onboard as we were told there would be.  As such we paid the cruise line for every item that needed to be pressed and had to send my husband's suits back to be re-done as they came back worst than when we sent them and my formal dress was simply not pressed!; (4) the drinks package was a joke!  the cheapest package was $19.00 per day per person (non-alcoholic).  I'm not sure if other people can consume that much in sodas, lattes and fruit punch daily, but it would take the three of us to consume that much.  If you wanted a soda or fruit punch, you had no choice because all the ship offered was water, flavored water, lemonade, and at breakfast, an apple juice that was too sweet to consume; (5) the excursions were very expensive and everyone seemed to beg for tips upon tips:  tip the driver, tip the tour guide, tip the guide on the river climb, tip the videographer and purchase his videos. Then on the transfer to the airport, the driver asked a bus load of people to not forget about him.  He stood at the bottom of the stairs with his hand out and actually, grabbed my husband's arm and stated ""nothing for the driver"".  I thought paying for the excursion included payment for all these people!  it was simply over-whelming."
4.0	Sail Date: Nov 22, 2014 /	"Definitely the largest ship in the World. The amenities are many and the ship is very accessible for people in wheelchair. The staff compared to other cruises were in general a 4 star. Of course there are many that exceeds 5 star. We felt that some of the staff were not as warm or outgoing as to our other experiences. The food at the buffets could have more variety for sure. We believe they keep it simple in order to promote the Specialty Restaurants more.

The Specialty Restaurants were of very high standards. Very Good. But the buffets can have more variety for those who can't make it to the specialty ones. Same as to the General dinning."
1.0	Sail Date: Nov 22, 2014 /	"This was one of the poorest cruises I have ever been on

Wheel chairs not  available upon arrival even though I checked several times to make sure they were ordered and confirmed  Told us to walk  to area for wheel chair wait.  This was quite a distance to  walk.   Family members  had a very difficult time getting to this area with no one offering  from the cruise line to help us.  Check in difficult  Credit cards mixed up  Rushed Rushed and Rushed    Family not able to stay together which made it difficult for me to monitor 9 people especially for those who needed assistance.

Rooms that were suppose to be connected were not.

Rooms were far apart

Room steward for one disable family member less than understanding and helpful

Food was  mediocre at best compared to other cruises   Dining room had to keep asking for wine

steward and drink waiter.  Menu limited  Additional charge for some items in dining room   This was never mentioned at any time during my time of trip arrangements

Could not make some of the shows as they were already fully booked especially the comedy shows

Were able to make rest of shows by standing in a line No provisions or exemptions for wheel chair

individuals

Experience getting off ship  worse than getting on.    Again would not let family stay together

Consequently some of luggage was left behind as there was no one to assist those with disabilities find luggage   Had to wait an extra two hours to get luggage that was left behind   Most of the difficulty was caused by the rushing and impatience  to  wait so family could remain together. There were only two adults who could help all other members of this party were either minors or someone with a difficlty"
5.0	Sail Date: Nov 22, 2014 /	The Oasis is a wonderful place to spend a week away!  The ship has everything you need and more with all the great restaurants and bars to choose from.  The staff is super nice and always friendly.  The ship is always clean or in the process of being cleaned.  Our cabin with balcony was really just perfect.  The drink package is the way to go if you like to drink, its worth it!  The food in the main dining room was great and you could get as much as wanted of everything!
4.0	Sail Date: Nov 15, 2014 /	"The ship was great and there were a few exceptional crew members and wait staff.  I do think the rooms need a little attention. We had "" My Time Dining"" at first I wasn't sure I would like it but I definitely would do it again. The one thing that I thought was wrong was getting an e-mail from Royal Caribbean  saying not to come until a certain time then when we do we have no time to get something to eat before the drill. I feel they did this as a ploy so that they didn't have a lot of people arriving at once."
5.0	Sail Date: Nov 15, 2014 /	I find it difficult to book our next cruise on any ship other than Oasis or Allure. These ships are AMAZING. The food and service are superb and the shows are absolutely Vegas-quality. There is something to do all day and night and the ports of call were great as well. Missed leaving the ship when the cruise was over!!!!
5.0	Sail Date: Nov 15, 2014 /	The ship was very cool. The only negative is the buffet open to late and closed to early. The only late night food was Pizza. The service was Royal Caribbean standard. Our rooms were nice. The boardwalk view was very good however a bit loud until around 11pm
5.0	Sail Date: Nov 15, 2014 /	"Really enjoyed our cruise. Plenty too see and do for ""mature"" cruisers. Food was great in the Silk dining room and well as the service. Did not like the Windjammer buffet as well, so did not go there. Food selection there (WJ) was mixed. Ran out of food I wanted a few times.

Had no problems with lines or wait times for food or activities considering the number of folks on the ship. Did have 538 kids, not ever a good thing.

Went on the Sister ship (Allure) in Sept. 14,  and actually felt it was a bit more organized.

Would go again since we love an Inside Balcony."
5.0	Sail Date: Nov 15, 2014 /	"This was my first cruise and I am so glad that I chose to sail on the Oasis of the Seas.  It had Broadway and Central Park themes.  The ship had a wide open street feel, with most of the ship having exposure to the sky.  It had good restaurants and very good waiting staff.  We chose The Chops restaurant for our Specialty Dinner one night and was very satisfied - excellent melt in your mouth steaks with 4 different sauces to compliment them with.  The other nights we ate in the American Icon dining room and had very good Starters, Main entrees and desserts to choose from.  There were only 2 things that I didn't care for (in which they had no problem taking them and replacing them with something I did like) the lasagna & an apple strudel (very dry).  They had excellent duck, cod, lobster, steaks, chicken, & shrimp selections.  Felt like a fancy dinner every night.  2 nights were ""formal"" nights, in which we all dressed up in our finest.   For lunch you could eat at the Windjammer which had Many many dishes to choose from.  Because it is an international ship, there were dishes that satisfied most cultures at all times.  Example: I noticed miso soup with vegetables to add was at breakfast, lunch and dinner.  

The entertainment each day was very very good.  They had great acrobats, divers, ice skaters, singers, actors, and comedian shows.  The adult game shows at night were very entertaining also. 

The kids really enjoyed ping pong, mini golf, The Flowrider, rockwall climbing and swimming a lot.   There was ice cream machines to dispense at their leisure. 

There were many things to buy on the ship; Watches, purses, jewelry, shirts....  There were promotions throughout the cruise ($19.95 for a watch, 50% off purses....)  Chances to win free stuff daily.  

Bingo looked like fun....didn't get a chance to play myself (planned to, but didn't get around to it with so much other stuff to do)

Yes, I would recommend this ship to anyone wanting to enjoy a vacation!"
5.0	Sail Date: Nov 15, 2014 /	Cruise started off a little rough.  When we checked into our stateroom, the TV was not working and the toilet was not working properly.  On the second day of the cruise, the toilet decided to break and water was spilling all over the floor.  Customer service was great!  They handled the situation quickly and professionally.  My spouse and I enjoyed the ship and our overall experience was great!
3.0	Sail Date: Nov 15, 2014 /	"The ship is lovely. The service was great. The accommodations were excellent. The shower was excellent!!

There were a lot of children on this cruise, babies crying, some small ones having tantrums, etc. St. Thomas is always nice to visit. St. Maarten was very nice [our first time there. ] Nassau , I could skip, would rather be on the ship's private island. Everything was nice......it's just a matter of personal preference.                 The check-in and check-out were well taken care of,very efficient  I do wish they had a  do-it-yourself laundry. [a plus for Princess]"
2.0	Sail Date: Aug 23, 2014 /	"The staff was not very friendly

Disappointed in the quality of our upgraded room

Poor communication

The dining room dinners were lukewarm, not fresh

Scheduled activities were not easy to find and they often didn't happen

On the morning of departure early breakfast was not easy to obtain

We did enjoy the couples massage, the adult solarium pool area, the fitness center and running track"
4.0	Sail Date: Aug 23, 2014 /	We were definitely impressed with the boat.  It's rather large but at the end of the cruise -- we decided -- it was TOO BIG!  Missing the Bahamas was a bummer due to the hurricane but we definitely could have picked up it on Thursday or Friday.  Very disappointing.  A $20 credit for port charges/taxes didn't cut it for me at all.  I am pretty sure quite a few people would agree with me.
4.0	Sail Date: Aug 23, 2014 /	Cruising on Royal Caribbean was a great experience. Staff was great. Food was a 9 out of 10. It would have been a ten if was delivered to the table hot. The dining room staff did a great job of trying but I understand it was out of their control. Activities were always going on to keep you engaged, Hoping I can plan another soon.
4.0	Sail Date: Aug 23, 2014 /	"My wife and I went with another couple on this cruise and had a blast. Royal Caribbean canceled the stop in Nassau because of weather, but that was not a big deal because all 4 of us had been to Nassau before anyway. We talked with a staff member on board the ship and she gave us some inside information on St. Thomas that was great. We avoided the crowd at Megan's Beach and had a great time on Water Island. Take the water ferry to Water Island, rent a golf cart from Kelly's Karts and tour the island and visit the bays for yourself. The ferry was $10.00 per person round trip and the golf cart was $40.00 for the whole day. There is even a secluded beach that Kelly can tell you about. The next day we went to St Maarten and took a taxi to airport beach and watched the plans land that was cool. We also visited Orient Beach which was not all that great. The weather was not to great that day and the beach was covered in seaweed. And the people wanting to give you a message every freaking 5 seconds was annoying, but it was ok. Our taxi driver was great, she was super nice and very helpful. She told us we should have told her we wanted to visit a less crowded beach and she could have hooked us up. Next time we will let her know for sure.

 

The only negatives we had about the ship were that the soda machines that fill your cup when you buy the soda package were scarce. They need one on every deck to handle the numbers of people. The other thing is there were A LOT of people on this ship. Its a big ship yes, but with 6000+ passengers and 2400+ crew it got tight. Just a note, Royal Caribbean should have ELEVATOR CLASSES for the people from other countries, as soon as the door would open people were trying to get on before you could get off. That got Super Annoying. Other than that, it was a marvelous time."
4.0	Sail Date: Aug 16, 2014 /	The ship was amazing, the shows were outstanding.  Cabins were small, not the best itinerary.  Food was so so, service was excellent.  Fun activities.
5.0	Sail Date: Aug 16, 2014 /	Ship was great. I hate reviews where you have to write something... so for now just filling up space.  I went, I saw , I sailed; That is all.      One member, Yatin from the Opal dining room was exceptional.
5.0	Sail Date: Aug 09, 2014 /	RCCL does it right with exception of getting off ship...very disorganized. Had a wheelchair in our party and no issues and a very spacious room. Excellent shows, the ice skating was my favorite. We had inside and outside balconies. Would not recommend and inside balcony over The Boardwalk for a light and/or early to bed person.
5.0	Sail Date: Aug 02, 2014 /	I cant say enough about this cruise.  It was fabulous.  If anybody gets bored on this cruise they need to stay their boring behinds at home.  I will have to do another one just so I can finish doing everything.  Staff was great, food was delicious and the entertainment was a blast.    I really liked the variety of foods that Royal Caribbean offers. Since I'm often cruising with my teenage son that doesn't make time to dine with me in the dining room I still get to enjoy a array of different dishes.  When I saw real eggs over easy I was so in love with this ship.   My son (15) saw his first Broadway show and met many people from all over the world.  This ship should be on everyone's bucket list.

Beyond these areas, the staff assisted when requested but weren't overly attentive. The ship was beautiful with tons of activities.
2.0	Sail Date: Jul 26, 2014 /	We were very disappointed in the service on this cruise. The staff seemed grumpy and not happy. The food in the main dining room was often cold and over cooked. My daughter found a dead fly in her sauce on her plate. It was awful. Water glasses not filled, ground pepper never offered. The small details and attention to service we loved on the Freedom were non existent on the Oasis. The entertainment was awesome and the ship is beautiful but the staff and service do not compliment this ship.

Re:  Royal Caribbean 7 Night Eastern Caribbean Cruise sailing on July 26, 2014-Aug 2, 2014

Oasis of the Seas

The whole reason for going on a vacation is to have no worries, unfortunately, that was not the case here due to your financial department.  Two days before I went on my cruise my credit card was compromised.  I immediately went to my bank, Bank of America, & got a temporary card.  I then called Royal Caribbean & the agent said she only needed the last four digits of my temporary card to make the change on-line.  I asked ‘don’t you need the entire number’, she replied ‘no’, and so she made the change.  When I got to the ‘check in’ before entering the ship the ‘agent’ told me due to the fact that my name was not embossed on the card, I had to go to ‘guest services’ to make sure they had my correct number for my credit card. I immediately went there & they said they already had it.  In my room, your ‘financial page’ continually came up on my screen stating that my credit card could not be charged.  Since I have to cut this e-mail short, here is the short version:   Four messages within four days were shown on my screen.  I made four trips to Guest Services & had to wait, of course, each time: once told it was a mistake, then again told this happens all the time the computer is simply updating, then told the problem has been fixed, then again twice told and two phone calls to Bank of America who said there was NO problem at their end.  The agent told me to ‘go have fun’ that the problem will get fixed.  I was upset at his answer, how could I have fun knowing that my card may not go through.  But I understood he has to make the passengers feel at peace, which did not work in my case.  Finally I put my card in front of the agents face & told him to please type in all the numbers off my credit card, one last time, into the system to see if it will go through.  And guess what?...it did go through at that time.  Could it have really been that NO ONE typed the complete card number into your system?  It finally went through the second to last day I was there.  This was very, very stressful for me, not what I wanted to deal with on a vacation.  When I returned home I went to my B of A to make sure all was ok.  And nothing at their end was holding my temporary card from being charged. 

I now have a permanent card with a permanent number and my business name, once again,  embossed on the card.

Your ship was fantastic, my 17 year old son had a blast, all food & drink service fantastic & I met some wonderful people.  However, I think the stress I had to deal with could have been avoided."
5.0	Sail Date: Jul 26, 2014 /	This by far was the best vacation I've ever had.   This was my FIRST cruise!!!!  The staff was amazing.  My family & I definitely felt like royalty.  Everything we desired was onboard the ship. The food was very good!!! The ports of call were beautiful!!!  We left on Saturday & were in Nassau, Bahamas on Sunday.  My seven day cruise was just what I needed....I'll definitely be sailing with Royal Caribbean International AGAIN!!!
5.0	Sail Date: Jul 19, 2014 /	"The Oasis of the Seas is truly that -- an oasis.  I was a little hesitant to take a cruise on a mega ship, because I was concerned about the crowds, but there is plenty of room for everybody. The adult pool area was HUGE, and we had no trouble finding seats on sea days.  The gym was fantastic and had new, modern equipment. The entertainment options were great and we went to almost all of the shows available.  

 

My only complaint is that if you don't buy a soda card, it can be challenging to find something to drink in between meals. The ice tea and lemonade are readily available on Carnival, and only available at a couple of places on the Oasis.

 

We are already looking forward to cruising on either the Oasis or the Allure next year."
5.0	Sail Date: Jul 12, 2014 /	"Amazing Ship,Crew are amazing,food and shows are beautifull.Can't explain the beauty of that ship,highly recommend this cruise, you have to see for yourself .Met so many people from guyana including the windjammer manager.I have to say they work very hard to keep up with everything.

Love that ship.I have cruise about 9 times,but this one is amazing.

Thank you Royal Caribbean.Good Job."
4.0	Sail Date: Jul 05, 2014 /	"There is not much to critique about the operation and maintenance of the ship.  Everything just went very smoothly.

 

The dinning experience was good.   The service was especially good during dinner time at Opus.

 

The excursions,  on the other hand,  are disappointing.   Labadee is good for soking in the water but the water clearity was very poor.   Jamaica had very little to offer other than packaged tours that are not very Jamaican.  Cozumel has more varieties but is still too touristy.   I am not sure if the Eastern Carib route is any better."
5.0	Sail Date: Jul 05, 2014 /	"This was by far the absolute most incredible vacation I've ever had in my life!! I'd been on cruises before, but this was my first time with Royal Caribbean, and it definitely did not disappoint.

 

Things I loved:

- THE CREW! They are the sweetest people I've ever met! They're all so grateful for what they do and they offer excellent service. The entertainment and cruise activities staff are so much fun!

- so many amazing things to do on board: rock climbing wall, zipline, Flowrider, ice skating, putt-putt, ping-pong, not to mention all the planned activities that are available!

- a variety of restaurants that are included in your cruise price: the main dining room, the Cafe Promenade, Sorrento's Pizza, the Boardwalk donut shop, Johnny Rocket's (breakfast is free), the Windjammer (buffet style), the Solarium Bistro (breakfast and lunch is free), and the Park Cafe!

- the dining staff does a wonderful job of meeting dietary needs - I am gluten-free and they always made sure I had what I needed

- the shows are top-notch, really talented people - we saw Hairspray, an acrobatics/music show, and the ice show (my favorite part of that was the sand artist!)

 

Here's what I would plan for differently next time:

- the shows fill up so fast and even though I reserved them online ahead of time, I guess I didn't do it early enough, because we had to miss a couple shows due to our dinner time overlapping with them

- if we wanted to go to a somewhat decent comedy show (for the record, the ""adult"" version is much worse than the PG-13 I was expecting), we would have had to skip dinner because that's the only time it was offered

 

Overall, I have no complaints and would absolutely do this cruise again in a heartbeat! I wholeheartedly recommend the Oasis for your next vacation!!"
4.0	Sail Date: Jul 05, 2014 /	Ship options for dining and activities is beyond compare. Although the ship is extremely large, you do not feel crowded. Port stops are routine which is fine for the first-time cruiser, but may to be expanded for returning guests.
4.0	Sail Date: Jul 05, 2014 /	"Ship was neat to experience....wait staff in My Dining were awesome....our Suite 6660 was excellent (minus never having both cold water faucets not working) and in a VERY convenient location. Being on the 6th deck and aft near the elevators was a Godsend as we were close to the My Time dining room and the activities on the main decks (6 for Boardwalk and 5 for Royal Promenade). Being aft on our deck also was convenient to take an elevator ride to the Concierge Lounge (deck 11), Sports/Pool deck (15) and Windjammer Marketplace (deck 16). Being that the ship travels to warm climates it would have been nice to have ice cream available at all times, especially after 8-9pm. Your only option after that time is ice cream that you have to pay for.

 

Areas of improvement could be in the room selection process, pushy photograhers, and our unyielding person assigned to clean and take care of our room.

1. Room Selection: We were told of our room 30+ days before we sailed and our cabin number was posted on our account on line and was confirmed at check in. Yet, when we went to our room, we entered the room and found that it was already given to another couple (as an upgrade for them cruising on back to back voyages) - and their luggage was there. While RC did a nice job at quickly fixing this error (and indentifying the correct room for the other couple), it didn't get our cruise started off on the greatest note and I questioned how this mistake could happen when rooms are pre-assigned well in advance.

 

2. Pushy photograhers - in them trying to get you to purchase their packages and not always clearly explaining how the pricing worked.

 

3. Unyielding maid assigned to clean and take care of our room - always wanted to know when we'd be out of our room, wasn't too kind in helping us get our clothing pressed for the 1st Formal night (a nice perk of having a suite), and not always understanding how the amentities of people a suite were to be handled (I'm talking about the smaller suite here).

 

But overall, we had a great time and found anyone we spoke with on the ship to be very accommodating to try and help us."
3.0	Sail Date: Jul 05, 2014 /	Food mundane,  ships announcments and entertainment very loud. will not continue with this review because of necicity of onehundred and fifty characters or more?
5.0	Sail Date: Jul 05, 2014 /	We have had 7 cruises and for our family anniversary this cruises was an excellent choice. This is an amazing resort ship, food was excellent and the customer service was the best we have experienced. Now with such a large ship you have to accept that it is going to be very busy. We choose the flexible 'my time' dining but we always select our times ahead. It is the best of both worlds. On the whole the entertainment was excellent. The club Broadway live two singers did a fine job empting the Viking lounge. The family comedy was somewhat risque but apart from these items the entertsainment was outstanding. Otherwise this was a great cruise.
5.0	Sail Date: Jul 05, 2014 /	Cruising is always nice, but cruising on the Oasis of the Seas is NICE!!!. So much to do and excellent food and staff. Cannot wait to go again. From the rock wall to the solarium, there is something to peak your interest and satisfy even the pickiest of person. Except for the noise from cleaning the pool, cannot wait to go again.
4.0	Sail Date: Jun 28, 2014 /	"Liked this cruise.  Second time on this ship.  On the other cruise I was with a large group. Just a small party on this cruise.  Enjoyed the small group for dinner.  Quite cozy.

 

Enjoyed eating in the dining room for breakfast on this cruise.  Did not have breakfast in the dining room on the last cruise.  Also ate lunch a couple times and founf the staff quite accommondating.

 

I found the quarters to be a little cramped. Love a balcony on the water but was quite comfortable with the interior balcony oner the boardwalk because we were able to see the water and many of the water shows.

 

We found it difficult to sign up for the shows.  Come fly with me had many problems on our show.  We did not get a chance to see most of it because of our dinner deating.

 

I was not impressed with the Headliner!"
5.0	Sail Date: Jun 28, 2014 /	Staff is unbelievably friendly. Our stateroom attendent David on deck 7 did a great job and we enjoyed seeing and talking to him everyday. We had my time dining. For dinner we specifically remember Edderic and Virgilio (846), Amar and Bojan (832), and Roel (852). They were all so friendly, polite and made us feel like celebrities. For lunch at sea we would go to the dining room on deck 3 and we were served by a woman named Iris who was also a delight. We were concerned that since there were tons of people on the ship we would feel crowded but that was not the case. Its amazing how the staff accomadates that many people. Food was great entertainment was great staff was great never a boring moment could not ask for more. 10 out of 10!
5.0	Sail Date: Jun 28, 2014 /	We had an extraordinary time. The ship was beautiful, clean and lots to do for the whole family. The shows were fabulous. The woman who did the sand art during the Come fly with me show was absolutlty astonishing. What talent. The staff was incredibly nice and helpful in every way. Our stateroom Attendant Marianna was the best we have ever had in all our years of cruising. We also were taken care of at the dining room by Gilbert who made our dining experience wonderful. I did complete the WOW cards and neglected to drop them in the box before we departed. Our server Marilyn and her assistant were also amazing. We would recommend this cruise to all our friends. It is way better than any Disney cruise or Carnival ship. This Oasis of the Seas is the fun ship. We look forward to another cruise on either the Allure or Quantum. maybe even another try on the Oasis.
5.0	Sail Date: Jun 21, 2014 /	A very beautiful ship. Much larger than I had anticipated. Service in some areas not the best. Dinning room service was excellant. Food in the dinning room was sub-par in the evening. Very good for breakfast and lunch. Cabin service was excellant. Rooms a little tight for moving around, particularly in the evening after one bed pulled out for sleeping. Central Park, Boardwalk were very nice. We are happy we were able to book this ship, but I would be just as happy on another RCL ship. Everyone should book this ship at least once. It is quite an experience!
5.0	Sail Date: Jun 21, 2014 /	"Excellent ship and staff

Only complaint is difficulty in obtaining reservations to watch the shows.

Staff was extremely courteous

Room mainatained very clean"
4.0	Sail Date: Jun 21, 2014 /	"The Oasis is a engineering marvel, beautiful, no motion felt while traveling. The cruise ship staff is  attentive, knowledgeable and make you feel very welcome. The main dining room setting is white table linens and a full complement dining staff. The menu is varied and very appealing. Several wines are offered to compliment the meal. The activies offered are many and endless. We especially enjoyed the comedy club and the ice skaing preformances. We only tried one specialty restaurant, the sushi restaurant for lunch. The menu was limited and charged extra for hot green tea? (base price was 10.00 dollars per person) This was my second experience with RC, and it was mostly  positive. Other cruise lines I have tried fall way below RC 's preformace vision.   

  The pools and jacuzzis during the day hours were beyond crowded. There was a perpetual wait line for the wave rider and the zip line. The windjammer cafe for lunch was a nightmare, best try other venues for lunch. While the casino ambience was appealing the slot machines were not!!!! The machines take cash and lots of it!  ATMs charge six dollars plus your bank fee, wow! 

  Charges for internet are $299.00 for two devices. Dont buy the drink packages, unless your are a very heavy drinker for kids and adults!  ( endless cokes, how much do you really want your child drinking, otherwise average 3-10 dollars per drink do the math)

  The ports visited were okay. Labadee had several beaches you could go to. The suite guests had their own private beach with shuttle service to get there. The lunch was freshly prepared and very good. Jamaica provided a fenced in area built by RC, and offered many shopping options. I found Margaritaville, yea!  Outside the gates was a total different story. If you are not extremely adventureous, well you decide. Cozumel was great. Offers free wi-fi on shore, cabs are cheap, a tour of nearby interest points runs about thrity bucks with tip. We visitied a tequilla plant and had a great tour, stopped at Margaritaville, and found very reasonable rental prices for sea-doos. (have cash on hand)  

  All in all, I would book with RC again, you learn a lot from each adventure. I would recommend a suite level. You definitely get extra perks, from preferred boarding at the Port Everglades Port,  extras in your suite,  preferrred conciere service, (private breakfasts, afternoon ordurves, reservations for preformances, private invitations to other gatherings). The cost for a suite may be a bit more but well worth it. The other thing I learned was decide before  you pick a ship just how many of the ships features are really important to you. I traveled with my two grand daughters and they used the features mentioned, pools, zip line, flow rider, late night clubs. Me the senior didn't need all that. LOL . Hope this helps, BON VOYAGE  ! !"
4.0	Sail Date: Jun 21, 2014 /	We spent 7 days on Oasis of the Seas and visited Haiti, Jamaica and Cozumel. Overall ship experience was fantastic. Food in the main dining room was excellent. Food in the buffet was ok - typical buffet food. We did go to Chops one night and we both had the filet - it was one of the best we ever had. Hairspray show was good. Comedy show was booked solid for every night and that happened on the first day. We did get to see it, but only because we stood in line outside the comedy show for 45 minutes prior to it opening to see if they had any unclaimed seats. If you want to see this show book early. The comedy venue is very small and when you have appox. 4000 people onboard and you can only seat about a 100 at a time - chances are you won't get to see it. One negative was the amount of unsupervised children and teens onboard. They were everywhere - even in the casino. One day while we were in the elevator three children (no adults in site) got on - the oldest couldn't have been more that six and they started pushing buttons and playing around. Shore excursions - Labadee - we did the zip line. It was an awsome experience. Unfortunately, it is over very quickly, but fun while it lasted. Jamaica - climbed Dunns River Falls. Another fun experience even for us older people (in our 60's). Cozumel - our excursion wasn't on Cozumel, but instead we got on a ferry ride for 45 minutes to the main land then another 45 minute bus ride to a water park for multiple things to do. We did tubing down the river (you have to propel yourself since there is very little current). We were able to jump from a cliff down into the water, we snorkeled and zip lined. Lunch was included along with beverages (alcohol and nonalcohol). We then had the bus and ferry rides to get back to the ship. Our excursion lasted 10+  hours and we were actually late getting back to the ship. Apparently, many excursions were late due to the need to go by ferry to the mainland. Overall, we had a very enjoyable vacation and the only reason we did not give them 5 stars was due to the unsupervised children and the lack of information that the excursion in Cozumel was going to involve 3+ hours of boat and bus time.

5.0	Sail Date: Jun 21, 2014 /	This is our second cruise vacation for our family. The cruise ship Oasis was huge and there were lots of shops, restaurants, and even Starbucks! The dining to state-room services was excellent. They were extremely professional and they treated you with utmost respect. We did not want our trip to end! We would recommend anyone who is planning to take a vacation to go on a cruise (any cruise with Royal Caribbean)! We had a wonderful time!
5.0	Sail Date: Jun 14, 2014 /	"When I booked this cruise on , I had no idea this was the largest ship in the world.  But as I departed and  became aware of all the amenities, activities, services, shows and wonderful service by everyone,  I was impressed beyond measure.  I have cruised ten times and this was by far the ""best"".The ports were inviting and loaded with things to do and see.  This was my first cruise on Royal Caribbean but by no means will it be the last.  My experience was positive from every aspect."
4.0	Sail Date: Jun 14, 2014 /	"Oasis is a marvelous ship with a ton of stuff to do.  The plusses of being so large are there are nearly unlimited activities to do and lots of space to do them.  The down side however is, unlike other ships we have cruised on, one has to meticulously plan each activity well ahead of time (read make reservations for nearly all the shows) to ensure you are not turned away due to the crowd.  Also because the Windjammer is so large and must provide for so many guests, the food tends to suffer a bit compared to other ship's Windjammers.  

     The ship was very efficient moving people on and off in the Ports of Call but with 6K plus people ""hitting the beach"" at the same time, not to mention other cruise ships being in port at the same time, getting back to the ship in a reasonable tme and  clearing customs/immigration is a bit of a hassle.  Worthy of note however was the Top Notch way Royal Carribean handled our particular situation. We were 3 1/2 hours late arriving at St Thomas due to an engine problem.  Oasis stayed an extra hour in port and we were provided a very Generous Onboard Credit for our troubles.  ""A Real Class Act"".  We of course will continue to book our cruises with Royal Carribean, only will plan on staying with the smaller ship classes."
5.0	Sail Date: Jun 14, 2014 /	Overall great experience. Staff friendly and helpful, great entertainment, food was very good and nice selelction, room was comfortable and well kept.
5.0	Sail Date: Jun 14, 2014 /	We were extremely pleased with the Oasis staff.  They were helpful in informing us with answers to any questions.  They went out of their way to accomodate us.  We were amazed at the organization and how easy it was to navigate around the ship.The food was exceptional.  However, my purchase of jewelry by the inch from a kiosk was dissapointing as the link to connect the clasp to the chains is not secure. One chain came apart and fell off on the first day. After checking the others they have to be fixed also. Unfortunately, this was found out after the cruise was over as they were picked up the night before departing. I would recommend RCCL highly.
4.0	Sail Date: Jun 07, 2014 /	This was a great vacation. There were 20 of us and we had a great time. My only compliant would be the breakfast. The ports were great, I would not be upset with them adding one more stop to the 7 days. We will be cruising with Royal Carribean again.
5.0	Sail Date: Jun 07, 2014 /	The ship was beautiful and there was so much to do. The shows were great and were much better than Princess Cruise LInes shows (which I think cater to an older audience) and the crew was exceptional! Everone bent over backwards to be helpful and friendly.WE really enjoyed all the eating options and the food was great!
3.0	Sail Date: Jun 07, 2014 /	went on this cruise with my daughter for my birthday...getting on and off was a breeze, mostly because I have to use a wheelchair, rather than walk a lot. The expensive room (outside balcony) was very small, spent the entire time walking sideways! The food was outstanding, except for the one night we dined at Chops Grille......the steak was tough and bland, service only fair, not worth the extra money!  The ship and the entertainment made the time worthwhile...just be sure and make reservations,we missed out on a couple of shows.
4.0	Sail Date: May 31, 2014 /	"everything was good with one exception !

1- At Nassau there was only one ramp provided to re-board, long line hot -hot day, it took appx 50 minutes to board, un acceptable !!!!! Customer service advised Nassau Port would only allow one ramp ?

This is hard to believe when Carnival""s ship docked next to us had 3 ramps to board with no lines, just tell your passergers the truth,  don't trying BSing them !!!!!!!!! Bill Leonard May 31st Cruise"
5.0	Sail Date: May 31, 2014 /	"the oasis was a great trip! the Staff, food & entertainment was great! we went on the trip for our 25th Aniversary & were spoiled from the time we got on the ship to the time we HAD to get off. :(

so many things to do it was hard to rest. our only hickup was getting into the shows, we didnt know you could make reservations prior to going. HIGHLY RECOMEND doing that. we did get into all of the shows but had to wait for all prior people to get in.we never got into the adult comedy show as that was packed everynight. :(  we'll get in next time. the food at the windjammer was great, we at ate chops for our aniversary dinner & were spoiled rotten, great food! johnny rockets was great, our server (Mike) was great & for $5.00 its all you can eat! but believe me one serving was enough for me. if you go on line to RCC.com you can also print out a sheet with all restarants that charge for meals & that are included with the cruise. go on the Oasis you wont be dissapointed.

5.0	Sail Date: May 24, 2014 /	"While Royal Caribean could not have been better, I was disappointed in cruises . Com. Once you had our money I felt abandoned. I had to call repeatedly to get flight info, port excursion details, and we never did receive the voucher we were charged for for the airport shuttle. Thankfully Royal Caribean was very helpful.  I would highly encourage anyone to use Royal Caribean direct and not . 

Not happy with  experience.  We should not have to worry on vacation.  We were promised our kids rooms would have 2 single beds and their birthdays would be celebrated, those od course did not happen either."
4.0	Sail Date: May 24, 2014 /	This was a great ship and crew, the hard work to keep her clean was super!  All the activites were awesome!  Did I mention how great the food was, top notch!  The shows and all the events were entertaining and fun, we apprecitate all the hard work it takes and the sacrifice each crew member made to make our few days a great vacation.  As hard as it is to deal with people, who can be so demanding, not one crew member broke down in front of the guest or argued among each other was task.(Bravo to the whole crew!)  These are all the reasons I enjoyed this cruise.  Only one bump we experience, that was not handled, and our cabin number was taken, as though we were going to be compensated, but nothing never happen. So I give 9 out of 10 stars!
4.0	Sail Date: May 24, 2014 /	This was our 26 cruise and the Grand Princess was the biggest ship we had ever sailed on.  The ship in itself was worth seeing and the shows were some of the best we have ever seen.  There were at times lengthy lines and we waited until we got on the ship to book the shows and they were all booked up so we did have to wait in the standby line to see if we could get into them.  We were able to attend every show but did have to wait in line to make sure we could enter the event.  The only thing that I was truly disappointed in was the food.  However when you are cooking for over 6000 people plus staff it was okay.  I would recommend this to anyone but not the first one as you need to experience the smaller ships and then like us wait until its your 26th one and then try it.  We like the smaller ones just as good.  But it is one that everyone needs to experience just once:)
5.0	Sail Date: May 24, 2014 /	7 day Royal Caribbean Cruise was wonderful in every way.  The entire experience was worth every cent and I would do again and will go again very soon.
5.0	Sail Date: May 24, 2014 /	Love the cruise and all the crew & employees; as always. A large number of passengers, but everything was organized and not cluttered. Enough elevators, restaurants, love the solarium (For adults only). I had a balcony stateroom and was very confortable.
3.0	Sail Date: May 24, 2014 /	"Am not going to spend an inordinate amount of time reviewing this cruise.  

By and large, the staff was fabulous; however, they are working against tremedous odds.  With 6000+ guests perhaps the Oasis needs more staff so that people don't have to spend so much time waiting in line.  I came on a cruise to relax, not to be stressed by waiting in line and worrying whether we were going to get into shows, dinner, etc.  

I was on the Oasis a few years ago and was impressed.  Oh well, not again."
5.0	Sail Date: May 17, 2014 /	Everything about the cruise was fantastic. We love RCCL  Have been on 6 RCCL before!!!!  The food, the service (always happy people wiling to help) the ship gorgeous and the best shows.  Will be back!!
5.0	Sail Date: May 17, 2014 /	"This was the first time my wife and I took a cruise. We are very happy with the cruise ship and, overall, the vacation. There was a plethora of activities on the ship throughout the days and into the evenings. We always had plenty of food options and it was all very good. The service and interactions with the ship's crews were also very good.

 

Realistically, with this being our first cruise, we expected more lessons learned and/or regrets. In the end, though, we have virtually none. This ship was a great fit for my wife and I.

 

If I was to pick one dislike, I would have liked to have seen more night time entertainment (adult). After about 10:00PM, things tapered off pretty quick. In the ship's defense, it's obviously a family oriented cruise ship. As such, I understand why late night activities were so limited.

 

Thanks,
Michael"
5.0	Sail Date: May 10, 2014 /	After many different cruises on many different cruise lines, our cruise on the Oasis was one of the best, if not the best. We had high expectations based on the reviews of others, but you literally need to see it to believe it. The on board activities catered to all age groups and interests. The selection of dining options was varied and delicious. The crew was delightful and efficient. Seeing the Pixar characters on board makes anyone feel like a kid again. The shows were top rate, especially Hairspray. We made dining and show reservations prior to the cruise so we never had a problem seeing the shows we wanted or eating at the time we wanted. Overall, experiencing the Oasis was a positive one and worth repeating.
3.0	Sail Date: May 10, 2014 /	"The Oasis is a beautiful ship, especially the Central Park area.  However, there were just too many people and everything was always crowded.  Long waits for elevators, no place to sit in the Promenade, long lines in the Windjammer.  We had rainy, windy weather on one of our days at sea which made us really glad we had a junior suite since we ended up spending most of the day there.  Central Park and the Boardwalk are a waste of space on bad weather days,  Our junior suite was very nice, the main dining room food was good, the Windjammer food was good and the entertainment shows were good.  The coffee (other than Starbucks) was atrocious!.  We didn't try any of the specialty restaurants.  The fitness center was very well equipped (but go ver early!).

 

The was our second cruise with Royal Caribbean, the first being on the Freedom of the Seas.  We're going back to the Freedom, which we liked much better, for our next cruise.."
5.0	Sail Date: May 10, 2014 /	Great cruise. Excellent food and service! This is my second time on the oasis, love the ship.  Very clean and well kept ship.   Entertainment was very good.
5.0	Sail Date: May 10, 2014 /	"I was really impressed with the fast service of staff boarding us, the ship is very nice and clean! Had a very good night sleep on my first night. Thats a big thing because I easily get sea sick. This time the whole cruise time, I felt so wonderful. The full service of our state attendant was so  great, we felt very special people. Overall the cruise experience- was a memoir to remember. It was my husbands first cruise ever and he thinks its the way to spent a very nice vacation and relaxation.

All the staff of the ship Oasis of the Sea , Royal Carribean are personally commended for a job well done...I mean Everyone....including the shows were awesome.. We will do it again of course...

Oh, by the way, my birthday was celebrated while we were on board, and I will not forget, it was just so special like having my friends around. Thank you .."
5.0	Sail Date: Apr 26, 2014 /	"Cruise 411 is an excellent company to deal with.  From beginning to end everything was handled for us and correctly.  Even the transfers from the airport to the ship and back were handled without any problems.  I highly recommend Cruise 411 and will use them again for our next cruise. 

 

The Oasis of the Seas is a wonderful ship.  There are so many activities on board.  If we wanted activity, we had it.  If we just wanted to relax, we could.  The talent in the shows was excellent.  The food all over the ship was excellent.  We are thinking of taking this exact cruise again next year."
5.0	Sail Date: Apr 26, 2014 /	"Our 18th cruise and I have to say, this ship is like no other, amazing, over 6200 souls on board and i asked my self everyday, where is everyone, ship looked empty to me, our best cruise by far, everything about it was amazing, thats the only word i can find ""AMAZING"" Where do i go from here ?"
4.0	Sail Date: Apr 26, 2014 /	"There is no question that with its sister ship, the Allure, this is a remarkable ship. There is nothing else like it.

My wife and I have been on over 20 cruises, most of them with Carnival. We believe the service and food to be very similar to Carnival's best ships. We typically reserve a junior  Our bathroom on Carnival Dream was larger with dual sinks and a spa tub.

We missed the nightly towel animals and the pillow mint.

Royal no longer puts pen and writing paper in the room.

Be warned, it can get quite expensive to visit one of the specialty restaurants.

For instance, at 150 Central Park, the bill for 3 of us with the wine pairing, was $345.00.

It was an exceptional meal, and for that price, it should be.

However, there is so much free to do on the ship, it would take 2 weeks to experience it all.

We would certainly cruise on this ship again."

5.0	Sail Date: Apr 12, 2014 /	Our cruise on Royal Caribbean's Oasis of the Sea to the western caribbean was a blast! This was our 1st cruise and we would defiantly recommend it to anyone. The ship was huge and had so much to see and do for families. The staff was also very friendly!
5.0	Sail Date: Apr 12, 2014 /	I was a bit worried that a 7 day cruise might become a bit boring, but I am happy to report that did not happen. Even after 7 days we had a couple of things on our to do list that we had not found time to do. Fro the most part getting around was quite east even with that many people. The shows were outstanding and I would recommend reserving them in advance of your trip. That takes you to the front of the line many times ahead of anyone making a last minute decision to go. This was only our second crusie and the service was miles ahead of MSC. Highly recommend
5.0	Sail Date: Apr 05, 2014 /	We had a great time.  All of the shows were first class.  Food in the dining room quality may have been a little below what we have experienced on previous cruises.  This is probably because they want you to pay extra for specialty dining.  Service in our room and at dinner was excellant.  Royal Caribbean is our favorite cruise line and we have tried many others.  I will not use  to book my cruises in the future because they did no give me the credit promised when I booked my cruise.
1.0	Sail Date: Apr 05, 2014 /	"did give me the best price, and it was easy to book, none of my review includes .

I have been on 11 cruises over 6 cruise lines.

 

Day one on ship everything seems fine until the dining room. A week before embarkation I reserved a private table for me & fiance. Once I get to the dining room, they try to set us at a large table full of people. This is how i've always done dinner in the past and it is OK, however I did make my request and was accepted a week previous for a table for 2. I explain this to the dining room manager, she replies to me loud enough for the whole area to hear: ""What, do you hate people so much that you can't sit next to them?""  How professional of her. I did eat in the dining room that night, and formal night only. The food was on par with their Monarch of the Seas, so I ate at the buffet the other nights, which wasn't so bad since it's the same food anyway.

 

My favorite island is Nassau, which this ship spent the least amount of time at. Didn't have time to eat breakfast and visit Atlantis.

St. Thomas looked like a freight yard and the boat spends the Most time at this island.

St. Maarten was enjoyable, specifically airport beach.

 

Reservations for shows are highly recomended. I didn't reserve for the comedy show, and never got to see it. This is my fault for not reserving; I think the room holds 40 people. 

 

The highlight of the entertainment was Mo5aic, a music group out of Las Vegas. Improv show was also good.

 

The ""neighborhoods"" are unique for a ship, but they don't draw the crowd. If you want to visit the buffet, you must wait in line before entering as it is always over crowded.

 

This ship is like a floating tourist attraction rather than a relaxing cruise. Everyone I overheard had seen it on TV and wanted to sail. 

 

I did love the ship itself, but the staff, entertainment, and food for 7 days is definitely lacking. 

 

I suppose the price is worth it if you want bragging rights."
5.0	Sail Date: Apr 05, 2014 /	This ship was awesome and massive with calm seas and a great itinerary. The Dining room staff was very friendly. The shows were Top Notch and The cruise director was very involved with the passengers. Its hard to believe there were over 6000 passengers onboard - we didnt have to wait in lines to see the shows and seating was never an issue. Thumbs up RCCL!
4.0	Sail Date: Apr 05, 2014 /	The cruise was at least as good as  I expected. I would say the overall experience was excellant.My wife and I were both hindered with physical problems and did not get off the ship since we had been there several times before. We were disappointed with the food in the dinnning room and the last three days we ate at the Windjammer. As for the shows they were outstanding. The service was Royal Caribbean to the best.We were dissappointed with  the travel agency, we booked the cruise in January for our 56 annversay. The agent told us she would be in contact with us to schedule the shows and eating time, we waited and decided to get in touch with her, she was never at her extension and the message would say she would calll, which she neve did and therefore we did not get boooked and had to fight the long lines and were not able to see all the shows.
5.0	Sail Date: Mar 29, 2014 /	Great ship!  Great food!  Great staff!  We loved the rising tide bar.  The shows were excellent.  The food in all the different venues were great.  The only bad part was that there were no limes, some drinks just need lime.
3.0	Sail Date: Mar 29, 2014 /	The ship is extremely beautiful with what seemed like an endless amount of daily activities to participate in. The night time activities were lacking though. The food was good but really in need of a better variety, I expected a ship of this size to offer better selections. Royal Caribbean also needs to expand their complimentary dining. There is definitely more additional cost restaurants on this ship that gives you the being nickled and dimed experience. The staterooms are entirely too small. We booked four people in what we thought was a stateroom that could accommodate all of us and was extremely shocked to discover otherwise. The crew would have to be the biggest and most unbelievable disapppointment on this cruise. I have been on 18 cruises now and have always enjoyed the presence of the crew until this sailing. Don't get me wrong, a few were somewhat pleasant but for the most part they acted completely miserable in their jobs. They rarely smiled, would avoid you if possible, and were rude when you talked to them. Our stateroom attendant was not entirely too bad and was probably the most tolerable crew memeber we came across all week. The crew on this ship is clearly stressed and over worked, this showed in their overall attitudes. I have always loved sailing with Royal Caribbean but have found myself wanting to cruise Carnival next year for our spring break.
4.0	Sail Date: Mar 29, 2014 /	We loved the ship and the trip was memorable. There was one problem when we went to the sports bar on air, to watch the semi final international cricket (ICC) , we were unable to watch and listen to the game. There was a poorly planned towel demonstration at the same time. They had both large monitors on the demonstration, and when we asked to get the audio, we were refused. We were shocked that a towel demonstration took precedence to internetional event.  We missed the game and unfortunately that tainted our experience.
5.0	Sail Date: Mar 22, 2014 /	"This was our 5th cruise and I got to tell you, the stateroom attendant (JOEL) and our main ding staff (MERICAR & ANTHONY) were the best we've had yet. All the ship's staff were very courtious and always welcoming. What can I say about the ship...it's huge, and even with that many people in one place, can still find a place to be alone....if you have that many days at sea, three+, you need a ship like this....always something to do....or do nothing always.....

2.0	Sail Date: Mar 15, 2014 /	"Beware of Senior Guest Services Officer ""Jasmine Naguimbing""  --says she has been doing Guest Relations for Royal Caribbean for 10 years

                                                                                                        --but asks my wife & I  ""Do you understand English?"" (note: I am fluent in English, French, & Vietnamese --having been raised in Winter Park since 1975

                                                                                                         --as this is our 2nd trip w/ Royal Caribbean (7-day cruise) but will be our last...

 

Guest Relations could not handle our concerns until I called Royal Caribbean corporate Miami office to complain (while on Day 2 aboard the ship)

where they were able to at least have empathy for our tight cabin space (called ""Superior Stateroom w/ a Balcony View"" for 4 people). This room is nothing more than an interior stateroom w/ a balcony view. It is not worth the $1,600 upgrade! The courteous Suite Attendant had to put our 3 luggages on top of the countertop for the whole 7 days (adjacent to the large vanity mirror & the flat-screen TV), in order to be able to walk around in the cabin.

 

Beware of Assistant Front Desk Manager ""Donovhan Rajcoomar""  --who could not help us either...he told me to go back to my stateroom, pick up the phone from my stateroom/cabin & call  to make a complaint and/or address my issues

                                                                                                                 --he says we must voice our concerns to our travel agent (i.e. )

& that Royal Caribbean cannot help me.  He then says I must ask for monetary compensation from  & not Royal Caribbean.

                                                                                                                 --But that's just it!!!  I did not ask or want any monetary compensation (Royal Caribbean is not even listening to my concerns of upgrading to a larger room)...I just have tight quarters for our family of 4 (2 adults, 2 children) aboard a big ship for 7 days. This is our first Spring Break vacation for our kids & did not expect to have such tight living quarters for 7 long days at sea. 

Eventually, I was able to have the head Guest Services Manager at Guest Relations ""Samantha Douglas"" call me from our stateroom on Day 3 & she apologized for the lack of customer service from her 2 Guest Relations employees listed above.

 

NOTE: From a large worldwide cruise line that's publicly traded on the stock exchange, I would expect the utmost care & customer service from Royal Caribbean but it was definitely lacking from the Oasis of the Seas Guest Relations crew.

            Having sailed aboard Disney Cruise lines w/ my family on 6 separate occasions since 10/2009, Disney has properly coined the phrase ""5-star

customer service.""

            Unfortunately, Royal Caribbean cruise lines must be more polished than this FIASCO cruise!"
4.0	Sail Date: Mar 15, 2014 /	"I found the dance floors too small. Not more than maybe six couples at a time.

The music I like was not offered as much as say jazz, easy listening , rock n roll, and big band sounds.

I think I stay with the smaller ships only because they fit me better as far as the type of music entertainment."
1.0	Sail Date: Mar 15, 2014 /	Had 2 very strange things happen on the boat that maintenance had to fix in our room and no one other then our room attendant said anything. 1. Brown liquid leaking from vent in shower onto floor leaving an area on the shower floor about 10 inches in diameter covered in the brown goo. 2. Sprinkler over bed released about 1/2 gallon of water? onto my husband while he was napping on the bed. What bothers me the most is that no one other then the room attendant said anything to us about the issues.
5.0	Sail Date: Mar 08, 2014 /	Our experience w when i did as most enjoyable; the room was perfect' the food was excellent and the attention we received was memorable! I rarely stood in line for any reason and when i did, it was never an inconvienience. The entire staff treated us with the utmost respect; at times we felt like royalty.
4.0	Sail Date: Mar 01, 2014 /	Cruise was great. Check in and boarding experience was good and rooms were ready on time. Dinner service in opus 3 was awesome, although I think they could offer a wider variety of selections (one night three different dishes were lamb). Service was exceptional. I am happy to say that they have enforced the dress code better, than our last trip on Oasis 6 months prior to this trip. Vintages was our favorite place to hang out and relax at night. Pools are a bit crowded and it's hard to find a seat if you don't go reserve it in the early AM. Windjammer is always packed but I love how they have a server seat you so you're not scrambling to find a table. Wish they had made to order omelets though! Disappointed about that for sure. Ports of call are good but I wish they offered more information as far as where to go where not to go. Some of the islands have a storm for being dangerous and it would be nice to know about safer locations to wander to. All in all it was a great trip and we will be back.
5.0	Sail Date: Feb 22, 2014 /	The best cruise I have taken.everything from the food to the service was excellent that tension to detail was definitely there the excursions were a blast and I like the gambling the shows were magnificentexpescially the water showI would highly recommend anybody who has not gone on a big ship go on this ship its like a huge city we went from 7 in the morning till 3 at night everydaythank you
5.0	Sail Date: Feb 22, 2014 /	Had 7 wonderful days on the oasis and the suite experience was well worth it.  It really helped us to navigate with so many people on board.  The concierge lounge was amazing and very helpful.  We had an engagement party onboard and they helped make it extra special.
5.0	Sail Date: Jan 25, 2014 /	Best vacation I have had in a long time.  My balcony stateroom was overlooking the Boardwalk with views of the ocean - i never wanted to leave my cabin.  Breakfast in privacy in my stateroom was very relaxing.  I only dined at the Windjammer buffet and I was never disappointed. My cabin steward Dexter was so nice and provided me plenty of privacy.   All the staff had smiles and greeted me everytime.  The entertainment was wonderful and I was able to watch all the water shows from my balcony.  So much to do I coudn't do it all.  I zip lined, ate donuts, pizza, ice cream, coctails, treadmill, vitality stretching, tv time, napping, sleeping late, laughing, entertained with ice shows/comedy/water show/musical, making new friends and totally relaxing.  This is my 9th cruise and will be difficult to board a smaller ship - RCL spoiled me.
5.0	Sail Date: Jan 25, 2014 /	"Can't say enough about the service and quality of this cruise.  The only thing we missed this time around was the little gifts that used to be left on our beds at night!  We looked forward to the surprise at night.  The other things we missed was the little booklets we used to get.  Not being of the computer generation - we didn't realize that these were listed on our tv in our cabin. We do have another cruise booked for next year.  After all the bad publicity of late we still look forward to it.

It might be a good time to re-do the thoughts on those little gifts!"
5.0	Sail Date: Jan 25, 2014 /	The Voyager Club was fantastic.  I met many friends from different countries and we did everything together, except for dinner with my family.  We had great weather.
4.0	Sail Date: Jan 18, 2014 /	"I went on the 7 day Oasis of the Seas cruise out of Ft. Lauderdale that stopped in Haiti, Jamaicia, and Cozumel Mexico. The ship had tons to offer from restuarants to shows you will never be bored. The restuarants served delicious food with great service as well, however one downfall being on a ship of over 6,000 was crowding the Windjammer, which was the main eating place. Overall though the dining expeirence was great and I would do it all again. On another note, the shows were all pretty spectacular. My wife and I saw all the shows and even went to the comedy club 3 times! Again, there are a lot of people on the ship so make sure you get your reservations or you get to the stand by line early. My one major criticism though is the difficulty in getting water. Even though water is easily available at all the dining areas in a glass, if you want to get a water bottle it is going to cost you. To make things even worse we purchased the ""beer package"" thinking it would include water, but no you actually have to buy a ""water package"". Lastly, the sales they have on the ship are kind of a scam. They try to hype up these sales when most of the stuff is cheap garbage"
5.0	Sail Date: Jan 18, 2014 /	"A street scene in one of the ports?  No, this is a ""street scene"" in Boardwalk, one of several spectacular venues of the ship itself!  You have to see it to comprehend it.  You feel as though you are in a land-based location when you walk along the Grand Pomenade or sit on a bench in Central Park or enjoy lunch at the Seafood Shack on the Boardwalk.  A week is scarcely enough to explore this magnificent ship.  As for specifics:

1.  Service was exceptional.  Everwhere we wnet, there were wonderful crew members to help us.  Here I need to name names:

Cabin Steward:  Marijana Jovovic

Housekeeping:  Agung

Bartender in Central Park:  Guilleaume Glace

Casino:  Lucinda, Boboslav. Tamara, Brenda

Cruise Director and staff:  Alan Brooks, Anthony

Wait staff in the Opus Dining Room:  Hershey, Santos, Miguel, and best of all, Carlos Ramirez

Server in Giovanni's Table:  Jeffrey Taylo

2.  Shows exceeded anything we could have anticipated or expected.  Do not miss ""Frozen in Time"", an Olympic-worthy ice skating exhibition base on Anderson's fairy tales.  The water show in the aqua theater was spectacular and beautiful.  Do not miss the Rosario string duo, virtuoso classical musicians on violin and acoustic guitar.

3.  The food was exellent everwhere, and there are so many places to eat.  We enjoyed breakfast at a different location every day, and they were all superior in quality and service.  The speciality restaurants are fantastic, but the ""free"" food in top of the line also."
4.0	Sail Date: Jan 18, 2014 /	The Oasis of the Seas is well worth the money just to be on board such a ship. The experience was really something, but we probably would go on a smaller ship next time. For 6,000 passengers it went smoothly, but last minute plans to see some of the entertainment was really not very productive. The ONE HOUR sales they have are a joke as they last several hours and the people who stood in line to be there at the beginning were feeling rather stupid and taken advantage of by the ship. The stops were nice, but they needed to tell you up front that you cannot bring any food or liquid on board after spending the day in Labadee.The cabins were very nice and well maintained by the staff. All the employees on board the Oasis were very pleasant and helpful. The food was good and very similar to other R.C. cruises we were on previously. We decided not to get the water package and were very glad about that decision. We did get the soda package and it worked out ok for us.We scheduled two excursions and ended up cancelling both of them to spend more time shopping for the wives. Overall it was a good experience for our fourth cruise and I would recommend it,if only to experience such a gigantic ship,let alone the other fine characteristics of the cruise.
4.0	Sail Date: Jan 18, 2014 /	"We had a delightful first cruise on the Oasis in early January 2014.  Initially we were hesitant to book our first cruise on a such a large ship since our primary goal was to rest and relax.  As expected, most of the public areas were always filled with people and children, however we booked a superior balcony room and it gave us just enough space to read and listen to music with the ocean as a backdrop.  We also really enjoyed the gym which was large and filled with many machines, an area for floor work-outs and on-hand trainers.  We enjoyed the Solarium restaurant because it seemed to be a little more healthy, and of course the meals in the Main Dining room were not so healthy, but they were wonderfully prepared.  The downside to our experience was the constant commercialization and ammenity sale.  From the time you board until you leave, there is a constant barrage of selling photos, drink packages, upgrading to restaurants for pay and even the privately owned island was about add-on sales.  

 

We are glad we took this trip, however our next cruise will be on a smaller ship with all ammentites paid!"

3.0	Sail Date: Jan 18, 2014 /	Got bad shrimp on my first night at Chops Grill was sick for 48 hours of course this dampened the entire experience as I had a fear of everything I ate.   My past experience of crusing was very relaxing however, this cruise you had to have reservations to do most everything and I found this very stressful and not at all relaxing.
2.0	Sail Date: Jan 11, 2014 /	"Poor service, poor food quality, we ate at the buffet, and we think that who use the buffet are treated like second clas pasenger.

Small cabin and old matress. Beautifull ship. to many restaurant that we must pay for eating."
4.0	Sail Date: Jan 11, 2014 /	"What can I say?  Its all about the ship and its been said before.  Ship is beautidule and huge, has everthing you could imagine and more.  Walking through Central Park seems more like a modern city than a ship.  I highly recommend it for families and a one time experience for all other cruisers.  Shows were very good and high quality.  Food a four out of five; Clebrity or Holland America would be a five.

 

However, don't expect the intimacy or service of smaller ships.  Hard to get seatings for dinner even out six months in advance.  Everything revolves arround hawking their restuarants, wares and services, and as expected, moving the masses through the ship in the most eficient way.  Never felt overcrowed except during parades down board walk.  

 

Don't do Atlantis excursion its a huge rip-off.  $80 each to sit on a almost undeveloped beach and not even be alowed to do the pools or attractions!!!!

 

Might do it once more with Grandchildren."
3.0	Sail Date: Dec 21, 2013 /	The ship was huge and had a lot of activities to do, but there were a lot of people as well on this large ship making doing the activities more difficult.  Because there are so many people it doesn't seem very personal.  The food was good but not great, because again I think they are cooking for way to many people.  This may also be due to the fact it was christmas break.  Maybe not on a holiday would be more enjoyable.  The ports were fun and the weather awesome.  Cabins a little small for 4 people, but great if you only have 2.  Entertainment was fabulous.
5.0	Sail Date: Dec 14, 2013 /	Truly enjoyed the cruise, accomodations, service, food, activities, and the ability to do nothing if desired. Only wish time had not been so tight in Nassau. Best port was St. Martin.
5.0	Sail Date: Dec 14, 2013 /	The ship was fabulous never wanted for anything to do.  The cabins were great and the staff was very professional.  With 6,000+ on the ship it was never crowded at any given point or time.
5.0	Sail Date: Dec 07, 2013 /	"THE SHIP WAS FULLY BOOKED WITH A POKER TOURNAMENT, BUT WE NEVER FEEL IT WAS CROWDED

THE RESTAURANTS WERE WELL ORGANIZED, WE WENT TO SPECIALTY RESTAURANTS, CHOPS, GIOVANNIS AND 505 CAFE, 

GOOD EXPERIENCE!!! 

WE LOVE LATIN MUSIC, TOO BAD BOLEROS  IN THIS SHIP WAS NOT WHAT WE EXPERIENCED AT THE ALLURE,  ALTHOUGH THE SHIP WAS FULL, BOLEROS WAS ALWAYS EMPTY, 

WE ARE DIAMOND MEMBERS AND ENJOY THE  DIAMOND LOUNGE FOR THE EVENING,  WE WILL DEFINITELY CRUISE AGAIN"
5.0	Sail Date: Dec 07, 2013 /	"Was a very fun ship. There was so much to do we didn't get to see or do it all. Guest services, waiters, stateroom service was excelent. Captain Dahlgren was the best. I have never seen a Captainl with as much personality and having as much fun as he did. My only thing for someone to consider would be the inside cabins with balconies on Boardwalk and Central Park. We were on Central Park and it was noisy and there was no privacy. At least 50 people at any point in time could see you in our cabin so we always had the door closed going out to the balcony and the curtains closed when we were inside our cabin. It is even worst on Boardwalk. We enjoyed the 2 parades and the shows. I would not go on this ship again only because the ports of call are poor. The only interesting port was Cosumel and that was because we sailed and raced with the Americas Cup sailboats.

Boarding the ship and getting off the ship was much easier than I had expected. FYI-- leavng the ship: When you see the luggage trucks are out of sight (meaning all luggage has been put in the warehouse for pick-up) go ahead and get off. We could have easily been waiting more than an hour longer had we not realized we could just get off when we wanted. A great experience on a unique ship. Definately worth the time. Would go on it again if they go o ther ports."
1.0	Sail Date: Dec 07, 2013 /	We had great expectations and excitment to be voyaging on the biggest cruise ship in the world.  The Oasis is indeed magnificent and wows you appropriately upon embarkation.  The spa is first rate and offers an array of services with professional personnel; the Solarium area at the bow of the ship is unique, airy and designed for quiet relaxation.  The rest of the ship is Disneyland with all its attendant sensual saturation.   But with up to 6400 potential quests (there were 5800 on our particular cruise) and over 2400 crew, crowds and comotion are not unexpected.  The real disappointment came with the food.  After experiencing a less than satisfying dining venture in the Opus dining room we opted for the speciality restaurant package of supposedly 'fine' dining.  It seems that 'fine' dining extends only to the ambience not the quality of the food.  By way of example, our final speciality dining venue was at Giovanni's Table.  My wife ordered a ravioli dish which came with a white sauce that had not been described  in the menu and consequently she was unable to eat it due to its fat content.  When we asked our server about this situation she sent out the chef who claimed that the use of a white sauce was indicated on the menu.  He also claimed that the fillet of sole I had ordered was fresh, when if fact it smelt so putrid that I was unable to eat another bite.  The water for our tea was so tepid that the teabag did not produce any tea coloration in our cup.  We did ask for and received boiled hot water after a long wait.  The table next to us ended up doing the same as they too had been delivered luke warm water for their tea.  We ended up leaving the restaurant with no recompense save a spagetti and non-existant meatball dish as a replacement for my rotten fish.  If you have read this far and are getting gastronomically squeamish then you should read a little more to be assured that you best pack a cooler of your own food if you do not wish be become ill on this ship of dreams.  We enjoy dinng in our cabin for breakfest and routinely order room service.  The first day our hot water for our tea came in an urn that reeked of coffee.  We called room service and another coffee smelling urn was promptly delivered.  The second day another coffee thermos was ceremoniously delivered.  I took it down to Guest Servives and spoke to one of the representatives who said she would recify the situation.  We were given a tea kettle on a plug -in tray and a supply of bottled water to make our oun tea in the room.  We also received a voucher for a champagne breakfest in compensation.  Numerous phone calls and verbal checks occured over the next few days as we miraculously received hot water in a new urn that had not been used for coffee.  Then we ordered our special champagne breakfest on the last sea day.  The urn was the familiar coffee reeker and the fruit plate contained mouldy and spoiling selections and dessicated cheeses.  Slimy, rotten lettuce leaves lay under the plactic cover of our plate.  We took the coffee urn and fruit plate to Guest Services and spoke to its head Tiaan Malan who was visiblly appalled and upset that such a week-long travesty had occurred.  We were financially compensated but the entire incident, needless to say, left a bad taste in our mouth (pun intended).
4.0	Sail Date: Dec 07, 2013 /	There was never a dull night on the ship. Every hour of the day there were some kind of activity going on to keep you entertained. The staff on the cruise were very nice and helpful.
5.0	Sail Date: Dec 07, 2013 /	My husband and I have cruised many times and have enjoyed every one, but this ship is above and beyond the rest!  The entertainment was unique and outstanding.  Service was great as well.  Highly recommend it!

I paid to be on vacation and I should not have been punished for that. trip was not very fun for my age group.30 to 35. Dance club not opening until 11pm or 2 am??  sorry but when you spend all day outside  you want to be in bed by that time.  Felt the shows are geared towards kids and older people. need to have more live music and better things todo when the ship is cruising for 2 days.  on a good note Weather was great and the time on the islands was a great thing.
4.0	Sail Date: Nov 30, 2013 /	Great cruise. Beautiful ship. The entertainment was excellent!!!!! Food in diningroom very good but still room for improvement. You pay enough to go on the cruise so not a fan of specialty resturants where you have to pay even more for a great meal(as on many cruises today) The only 2 improvements I would like to see is better desserts and more choices for late night food options. Only a pizza place and a small cafe on a ship that has 6000 aboard for late night snacking! Other than that it was a wonderful cruise. Very organized, Good customer service and so much to do. Would definitely recommend :-)
2.0	Sail Date: Nov 30, 2013 /	We just sailed on the Oasis and our experience was mixed. We upgraded to a balcony thinking that we would be able to have fresh air and enjoy the view. This proved to be very wrong. Within hours of boarding, both sides of our cabin had smokers on their balconies. My wife has allergies and smoking gives me a headache. These people smoked every morning and evening thus rendering our balcony worthless. There is no smoking in the cabin and only in the Casino and one other designated area, but it is perfectly allowed on the balconies as long as you get an ashtray from your attendant.  Our family would have been better off with a cheap inside cabin instead of smoking neighbors on the expensive balcony.
4.0	Sail Date: Nov 23, 2013 /	"The ship was beautiful, if the travel agent  did not mess our dining time and gratuities it would have been great

5.0	Sail Date: Nov 09, 2013 /	Beautiful mega ship with excellent signage which made it very easy to find ones way around while on board. The cruise ports of Labadee Haiti and Falmouth Jamaica were as expected. Labadee has some nice beaches with some beautiful views but not a whole lot else outside the immediate area. Falmouth has A nice enclosed shopping area right off the pier with good prices for  the usual cruise gifts/souveniers. It has no beaches in the immediate vicinity and once outside the fenced enclosure near the ship is a very poor area of dilapidated shops and merchants and  a security force that is lacking. You are definetely on your own once outside the enclosed area. The main attraction is definetely the ship and it did not dissapoint. My wife is disabled an we booked a handicap accessible room which was spacoius and well equipped overlooking the boardwalk. Very different view from the balcony as we were able to see the boardwalk,ocean and zip liners. It was never a problem to find lounge chairs on the deck and with all the passengers on board it never seemed overly congested. As a matter  of fact you could always find a peaceful area in numerous places on the ship at any time if desired. The only traffic jam would be near the elevators after shows or special events and this is expected and occurs on most all ships. The numerous shows and parades were elaborate and first class. We used my time dining and made all reservations prior to the cruise and it all went as planned. All in all a great very smooth cruising giant ship. Its going to be a little hard going back to a smaller ship after you've sailed on this monster!!!!
5.0	Sail Date: Nov 09, 2013 /	"Wow! where do I begin.

The zip line was excellent as well as the wave pool.  We play put put golf, while the teen enjoy basket ball.  The grandkids loved theon board  water park and the skating rink. The shows were absolutely amazing.  But most of all the food, such a very large varity from all diffrent cultures.  The service was superior and our room was great.  I am a gold frequent cruise sailor with Carnival curise lines, having sailed 14 various cruises.  NO MORE, it Royal Caribbean all the way."

5.0	Sail Date: Oct 26, 2013 /	"This was our second time on the Oasis.  We loved the ship so much 2 years ago that we decided to do it again.  Both times were Halloween trips.  1st time to Jamaica and loved the people.  Sad that there is so much poverty, but we still loved it.  Other stops were fine also, but we were really there for the ship experience which turned out to be even more fun than the 1st trip on the Oasis.  Entertainment is world class.  Food in the main dining room was outstanding.  Actually, it was better than outstanding.  Service every place was top notch.  Servers, maitre de took awesome care of us.  I'm gluten intolerant and the selections were enormous.  Even better, the quality was beyond expectations.       

Ship very easy to get around, but you better like long walks.     Our cabin was overlooking the Central Park which I think is considered an inside unit, but it was awesome location.    Cabin was smaller than last time, but we chose least expensive.  Wish we'd taken a bigger cabin, but plenty of storage and well kept.     Ship starting to need a small amount of refreshing, but with all the usage, to be expected.               Entertainment, wow.  Done lots of cruising, lots of great shows, but this was one step above.  Definitely Broadway or Vegas class."
5.0	Sail Date: Oct 26, 2013 /	We really had a wonderful time with out time on Oasis of the Seas. Our favorite thing was the 24- hour jacuzzis because we are night owls. We really had a wonderful time and would recommend it for every type of couple!
4.0	Sail Date: Oct 26, 2013 /	The very best part of the cruise was the dining experience each evening. We choose anytime dining but we got the same servers every night. We also brought our 4 yound children with us so like any parents dinner was a scary thought. Dinner took 1 1/2 to 2 hrs each night which is a long time for kids to sit. Alexio and Olano kept the kids busy and entertaned each and every night. They by far gave us the best customer service I have yet to experience on the 6 cruises I've been on. Be sure to book your shows on the ship before you get on. This ship is so big there isn't eveough seats for everyone to go to shows as they pease so you book them like excursions.

The one area we were disappointed in was the internet.  It is very slow and that cost us money.  I do not understand why Royal Caribbean cannot get a faster interenet.  I will not purhase another internet package as long as it reamins that slow.

The food was great in the dining room and the Windjammer.  The shows were also great"

5.0	Sail Date: Oct 19, 2013 /	My husband had just returned from 3 years in Afghanistan and we went on this cruise as adult time away. This cruise was AMAZING and we would definately return for another vacation. We were worried with the large amount of guests on this ship that there would be lines or crowded areas, but our experience was the exact opposite! We never waited in a line or felt crowded. The only negative thing we felt was the food in the dining room was mediocure. It almost felt as though they were trying to get people to eat in the specialty restaurants more by serving less quality food in the dinng room. We did utilize 3 specialty restaurants and they were delicious! The entertainment was wonderful and like no other ship we have ever been on! Each show was very entertaining and kept our attention. Our stateroom attendant was so nice and took great care of us!

4.0	Sail Date: Oct 12, 2013 /	"As a regular cruiser but a first time Royal Carribean cruiser, I enjoyed the cruise and the ship was amazing. Some differences I observed from other cruises I have taken: It is nice to be able to pre-reserve shows but being at the venue 15 minutes before the show is difficult if you have second sitting dinner. If you don't make it by then, the venue is open for anyone and there might not be room for you. The variety of entertainment options was fantastic but the performances were not as polished as I'm used to (with the exception of ""Hairspray""). Often the dancers were not in unison and some of the singers did not have very strong voices.  

 

I have never dined at a specialty restaurant but our friends wanted to so we made our reservations at Chops before embarking. We did not know it was a formal night when we made the reservation and didn't want to waste our formal wear (or miss out on the formal photos) so we dressed in tuxedos and gowns. We were very disappointed to see the other diners in extremely casual clothes (even shorts!) although the dress code is ""smart casual"" (jackets for men, dresses or pantsuits for women). In fact, the dress code seems to be totally ignored in the main dining room too. It is NEVER appropriate to wear shorts in the dining room, even on ""casual"" nights. Guests that are inappropriately dressed should be directed to the buffet at the Windjammer restaurant.

 

For the most part, the food was good. The desserts were excellent! Unfortunately, the dinner at Chops was not what we expected. Although we ordered our filet mignon either rare to medium rare, and they were cooked to those specifications, the meat was dry. I have never experienced that phenomenon. I can only attribute it to poor quality beef.

 

We were shocked the day of embarkation when we went to the Seafood Shack for lunch and discovered we had to pay for the meal. In fact, we had to pay extra for many venues and activities onboard. On other cruise lines the only extra charges are for specialty restaurants and that is very made very clear. When we dined at Chops we were asked if we wanted plain or sparkling water. We all asked for plain and nearly fell out of chairs when we were charged $50 for WATER for six people! We were never given the option of tap water and assumed the water was free.

 

The ports of call were as expected and our booked excursions were well- organized and a lot of fun! Next time, however, I will probably wait to make our reservations onboard because the website doesn't give enough information and we might have made a different choice or two. Of course, then we run the risk of the excursion being full. 

 

To sum up our impressions of the cruise I would say that everyone should take one cruise on an Oasis-class ship but it should be one of their first cruises. I prefer smaller ships with better food, entertainment, and more ports-of-call."
3.0	Sail Date: Oct 05, 2013 /	The ship was too large for our taste.  There were too many passengers .  It was not the intimate kind of ship we were used to.  When we had dinner the table was usually with six other couples,most of who we could not understand because of they could not speak English very well.  The food was not up to the standards we have always expected from royal caribbean and the service was not up to par.  The ports we choose did not have many choices unless you went snorkeling or did under water activities.  All the islands were so commercial it took the fun away.  The ship was beautiful but way too crowded to enjoy just walking through and sight seeing.  I would not choose to,go again on a large ship nor would I recommend this cruise.

4.0	Sail Date: Oct 05, 2013 /	"First time on such a large vessel, and was happily surprised. We stayed in stateroom 12241 with was on Central Park. We found the room nice but next time we will go for an outer balcony. Very noisey and could not utilize the balcony. One complaint is it seemed that the A.C. at times was shut off by the cruise line.

 

The buffet was adequite if you could get in. The specialty resteraunts were excellent, Our favorite was Giovannis Italian resteraunt. Johnny Rockets was excellant also.

 

The shows were of good quality, and went to as many as we could.

 

Getting on the ship was a breeze, now getting off was another story.

I would highly recommend this ship as there is alot to do even for the little ones.

 

 Some minor issues but the cruiseline took care of them."
5.0	Sail Date: Oct 05, 2013 /	"We had an absolutely wonderful time on this cruise!  My 84 year old Mom was riddled with Cancer and she had an Eastern Carribean cruise on her ""bucket list"".

So my Sister and I got together and worked up plan to take her.   The boarding was VERY fast and before we knew it we were in our cabin which was beautiful but an inside courtyard balconey.  If you don't like noise and like to sleep in - I don't suggest this as they start making noise out there in the morning by around 8:30am and there is a lot going on at night too.  We never minded as we were up for meals and so on but looking at the outside cabins - I would DEFINITELY do this if I went in the future - outside balcony.  You get the feeling of the sea throughout and it's quieter.   Also the aft or back end of the ship rocked a lot more and the front rocks a lot more and the middle was steady - so I'd suggest an outside balcony as close to the middle of the deck as possible.   I didn't notice any one deck or other being better otherwise, but we liked being the 8th as there is a  park type deck which was easy to cross and pleasant for getting from one side of the ship to the other - less crowded than the promenade deck which was more like walking through a mall to get to the other side of the ship or the pool decks which were really hard.

What we LOVED was the room and food service - especially at night.  We had a veteran waiter of 21 years with Royal Carribean named Herb, who was SO pleasant and knowledgable about the food, that every evening was like a super pleasant culinary adventure.  We loved the 6-8:30 slot for dining with a table that was a sure thing (next to a window which was beautiful) every night.  We just loved dinner everynight and it was definitely our favorite part of the cruise.

Our cabin waiter was just amazing - so nice and helpful.  My sister got a headache from dehydration and he looked after her, brought ice for my Mom's ice packs and was just SO nice to us the whole time.   The crew was definitely international.   The shows were great - our favorites were the Broadway production of hairspray and the headliner, followed by the Ice show and ""Come Fly with me"" which was a fun one - more Cirque de Sole in nature but had some really retro broadway flare like tap dancing and singing.  Our least favorite show was the aqua show as we just couldn't follow the story line very well - it seemed discombobulated theme-wise but there was definite talent in the pool.  Sea World put this to shame (of course), but it was still fun to watch.   Starbucks was great to have every morning  - we ran down to get coffee.   One BIG THING was that my Sister rented my Mom a scooter and that thing saved ALL of us at one time or another as that ship is BIG and there was a lot of walking.

We thought that the Kareoke times were WAY to late at night as we were tuckered out by the time they had that nightly - usually we like to see that on a ship, but this one was too late at night except for the final day.  The spa, though we did not use the services was absolutely GORGEOUS - will try that next time. There were SO many bars, restaurants etc. to find around the ship - we could hardly see everything in the 7 days we were on board.  We just had a GREAT time.  Even though you are sailing with 5800 other people - you NEVER felt like it the whole time.   We just loved our cruise and would do another one (different just for the experience).  We have enjoyed all the Royal Carribean Cruises we have taken.  About the only negative about the whole thing was that for the money - we felt like we could have had REAL maple syrup with breakfast items instead of ""breakfast syrup"".  They did not do a good job of any of the breakfast waffles or pancakes throughout  - it was like cardboard with corn syrup colored brown on it the whole time....otherwise, food was good and service was GREAT!"
5.0	Sail Date: Oct 05, 2013 /	Our cruise on th Oasis of the Seas with Royal Carribean was fabulous...  AGAIN! The ship was clean and very friendly.  The numerous food venues were always stocked with outstanding variety. The staff was cordial and professional. There was something to do every half hour and this ship seemed particularly child friendly.  My only complain was my wife's and my inability to see the major shows.  All of the reservations had been secured months before the sail date and were had not been apprised of the need for such early reservations.  This had not been a problem in our previous 3 cruises.  Our weather was a blessing and the disembarking proceedure was very organized and accomodating.  We will definitely cruise with Royal in the future if our health remains secure.
4.0	Sail Date: Oct 05, 2013 /	My family had a wonderful time and beautiful ship.  The Oasis is by far the nicest ship that I have been fortunate enough to vacate on.  My wife and I have gone on many many cruises and the embarking process and on board activities were as organized as Ive ever seen!
5.0	Sail Date: Sep 28, 2013 /	"Had a wonderful time. Cabin was super, inside balcony overlooking Garden, view was fantastic and very quiet.

There were 6,000+ guests on board, however it never seemed crowded.

Shows were excellent and very professional.

Cannot say enough about the staff, always friendly and willing to go the extra mile to make sure things were going well.

We had early dinning on deck 4, table 418 and our dining staff were all exceptional!

Would recommend this cruise to anyone from new cruisers to experienced cruisers like ourselves."
5.0	Sail Date: Sep 28, 2013 /	"It was a great cruise.  I cruised solo but I was not bored for a minute, there is sooo much to see or do.  I did not get of the ship by design.  I took the cruise because of the ship, the same as many of my fellow frequent cruisers did.  It was my 20th cruise and did not think I could be enchanted but I was.  If I had to pick one high point it was the Ice show.  I saw one on the Freedom of the Seas but this one was even better

 

The organizations was great.  It never felt that there were over 6,000 passengers.  Starting with checking in to getting to my car.  I loved the Central park and the fact that there were umbrellasfor borrowing all over.  It was the ultimate thoughtfulness

 

The ship had one  drawback: uncomfortable balcony chairs.  I would have prefered chairs with high back and possibly an otoman.  I barely used my balcony because of it.  There were very many other places with comfortable chairs but I bought a balcony cabin to sit, read and enjoy it"
5.0	Sail Date: Sep 28, 2013 /	EVERYTHING WAS GREAT. NO COMPLAINTS. BEAUTIFUL SHIP GREAT SERVICE.  I WILL RECOMMEND OASIS OF THE SEAS TO MY FRIENDS & RELATIVES.  WE HAD A WONDERFUL TIME.
4.0	Sail Date: Sep 28, 2013 /	"I was amazed    at the Oasis ,its size and beauty and as usual we never got bored !

I, did have a few things that bothered me though , tips have went up in cost , but you dont get the ammenities as you used too .Very disapointed on that  ,and if you did want some amenities you have to ask , and you get same as you would in hotel ,when i was on freedom of the seas we got razors lotions ect....just sems like you pay more for less ... Other than that show were great would love to try allure ship next."
5.0	Sail Date: Sep 21, 2013 /	"Hello!
Wanted to express our great experience on this recent cruise from 9/21/13 thru 9/28/13 on Oasis of the Seas .. to Bahamas, St. Thomas & St. Martin ... It was a smooth cruise, as if one was in a hotel lobby enjoying city shows and delicious restaurants not to mention the staff was professional, polite & very friendly. 
Overall I would surely recommend this cruise ship to anyone I know and with a huge 
menu of entertainment, sports, leisure, shopping and relaxation ... this ship truly covers all the basis and much more. My wIfe & I & friends had a great time.
CHEERS!!
All the best, 
Rossetti's, Difeo's & Pizzicanella's"
5.0	Sail Date: Sep 21, 2013 /	"When was the last time you took a vacation and had nothing to complain about?  Oasis of the Seas to Nassau, St. Thomas and St. Maarten,  was our first complaint-free vacation.  There were so many highlights, I truly do not know where to begin.  From boarding (the smoothest process I've experienced) to disembarking (from cabin to taxi in 5 minutes); this is definitely a five star rating.  You enter the Oasis and are immediately awestruck by the décor, lights, friendly crew, Rising Tide Bar, restaurants--it's a mini mall.  Then you wander into the Boardwalk with the spectacular view of the sky, carousel and aqua theatre.  Then you take a stroll through Central Park and stop for your first drink of the day, sit and admire all the detail put into this work of art while pondering whether or not you are truly on a ship.  We decided to tour the ship while we waited for our luggage to be delivered to our cabin.  Let me be clear, you WILL become lost on this ship so take advantage of the signs indicating where you are.  We explored Deck 4 where we found the Jazz Club, casino, Opal Theatre and Blaze Disco, Took the elevator up to the Solarium--the adult only set which housed a swimming pool and 3-4 hot tubs/whirlpools.  We left the Solarium and wandered over to the other side only to find additional swimming pools, Pool Bar, kid's pool, WipeOut Café, zip line, basketball court, WipeOut and an amazing view from the back of the ship.  And so many places to eat!   Buffets (everyone should be able to find something they like at this buffet), specialty restaurants, Johnny Rockets (malts and burgers), Sorrento's (yummy pizza), Chops Grille (melt in your mouth steak), just endless meal opportunities--never have to eat the same thing twice unless of course you want to.  Our cabinkeeper, Tyron, never missed a beat--loved the fact that he called us by our names when we met--he kept our cabin spotless and provided us with privacy when needed.  Love the crew's cheerfulness!   Had a spa treatment at Vitality Spa and we had manis and pedis.  Again, superb service and crew.  We never left the ship when we docked at Nassau, but we did get off in St. Thomas and St. Maarten.  Purchased beautiful jewelry.  We took a taxi to downtown St. Thomas to do shopping and explore Magic Ice--it felt good to be in the cold after being out in the 90+ temps.  Took the water taxi to St. Maarten's downtown when we arrived at that port.  Walked the streets, shopped, had lunch at one of the beach restaurants and listened to a live band.  I am reminded of Hawaii where everyone ""hangs loose"".  Loved chatting with the locals.  Spent the last two days at sea at the Solarium getting some sun, going to the shows (which are all amazing) and finding new places that we hadn't seen previously--like the Viking Crown lounge where we listened to live music (a violinist and pianist) while having cocktails.  I could have stayed another week or so on this ship.  We were celebrating our 25th wedding anniversary and it was just what my hubby and I needed.  We have planned to make this a yearly vacation.  So, five stars and thumbs up to Royal Caribbean's Oasis of the Seas and staff!"
5.0	Sail Date: Sep 14, 2013 /	on sept 14th i didn t know what to expect on such a big ship,i was very suprise there no long line to check in.Everything is so well organised ,it took me less than !% min to ckeck in ..From the momment the ship sailed the fun began,a non stopped adventure,parties,places to visit on the boatsuch as central park.coney island,musics and a staff determined to give you a good time.Every day was different ,from the moment you wake up until the time you go to bed.Shows,carnivales, parades and the food,services,cleanliness OMG i need another vacation there was not enough time to see the whole ship and all that is offered.I will returned next year with my family and friends that a promise.Ithank you very much for the excellent room that you guys gave me.See u next year sincerelly,Mrs Laumonier and daughter Ingrid
5.0	Sail Date: Sep 14, 2013 /	"This is the 4th time we have cruised the Oasis and it never disappoints us.   We love the alternative dining.   We only ate in the main dining room once.   The entertainment is wonderful.  The staff is always helpful and friendly.
The two thing they did different this year than the other years that I did not like is they make you take my time dining and prepay your gratuities - If they are prepaid add that into the price of the cruise!  Also they push their dining, drink packages every where you turn.   In the specialty restaurants they push their cookbooks, wine package etc and when you do the package you get it at every place it becomes annoying."
5.0	Sail Date: Sep 14, 2013 /	"We have been on many cruise ships and this is the culmination of all the good things
about cruising. The entire staff was fabulous. We did not come across one that
was not professional, friendly,and go over and about to help you.
You would think with 6200 guests there would be chaos. NO WHERE we went
was there anything we could no get,there were no lines anywhere.It was truly 
amazing. We had a balcony stateroom which is what we always get but this one
was larger and the beds were like sleeping on clouds!!!!Even the bathrooms were
a good size. The shows were outstanding. Room service was the best out of all the ships we have been on.EVERYONE one of them were outstanding. I don't know where you got your outstanding crew but they are all to be commended."
5.0	Sail Date: Sep 14, 2013 /	"We were repeat guests on the Oasis.  We could not find anything to complain about. Every meal was presented beautifully and tasted scrumptious.  Largest variety of breads onboard.  With over 6100 guests that week, we never had to wait in line for a show, check-in, lunch or dinner.....a seamless experience.  Every venue is beutiful.
We enjoy having a balcony overlooking Central Park, our friends enjoy overlooking the Boardwalk.  All the entertainment shows and costumes were top notch.  The Staff was very friendly and always their to help.  Would highly recommend and looking forward to try the Allure.  We have a RCCL TransAtlantic planned next April already."
5.0	Sail Date: Sep 14, 2013 /	Excellent experience -  staff was fantastic - accommodations just as good.  The only recommendations were to improve the crowd management in the Windjammer dining room and improve the color of the arrow on the ship location map.  The ships speakers were inaudible throughout the entire cruise except when you were sitting/standing under them.  Recommend all announcements be placed in the message box on the TV screen for viewing.
5.0	Sail Date: Sep 07, 2013 /	Fantastic trip, smooth sailing, so many things to see and do there is no room for boredom!  Excellent children's activities as well as adults!  Staff was amazing and not up in your space all the time, which is so refreshing.  They are there when you need them, but not pushy and over zealous.
2.0	Sail Date: Sep 07, 2013 /	Our overall experience was very nice. Enjoyed the cruise and on board experience. Unfortunately, at the very end we had a bad experience. When we went to pick up our bags in our pick-up area (46) only one bag was there! Of course it was my wife's bag!  She was quite upset.  We had to look in every bag area to try to locate to no avail and could have missed our flight. We left without our bag. I do not like the way the bags are picked up by the cruisers. They are left for anyone to pick up and ours was.  Why do you just let these bags sit for anyone to run off with?  Nobody checks to verify that people are picking up the right bags.  We had just had a discussion with a neighbor about how they also had lost 2 bags the previous year.  I believe you need to get a better handle on how to deal with this process.  As it turned out our bag was shipped to a local hotel and very fortunately returned to your ship.  It was sent back to us via Fed-Ex. There was one item missing and the TSA lock was taken off.  So, someone at the ship or hotel opened our bag and stole an item.  Things in the bag were also out of place and obviously searched for valuables.  This all leaves a very bad feeling with us and at this point I have no desire to take another cruise with Royal Caribbean.  Cruiseline was great though.  This was not your fault.  All that you did was done well.  Thank you.
5.0	Sail Date: Sep 07, 2013 /	This was our second cruise on the Oasis and we cant fault it. Everything was top class for us. We ate in the main dining room for dinner and the Solarium for lunch and breakfast. The entertainment is the best we have ever experienced on a cruise ship and we managed to see all the shows. We only booked the cruise 7 days before sailing and knew from past experience it was wise to book the shows asap which we did on line. We will do this criuse again and for the record we have also cruised on the Allure of the Seas - just as good. For the record, we have cruised on smaller ships ( 500 passengers ) which we also enjoyed
5.0	Sail Date: Sep 07, 2013 /	"The Oasis of the Seas was so much fun.
We had a group of 6 and we loved going to the shows after dinner and enjoyed spending time together as well as each couple could do their own thing whenever they wanted too.
Being on the ship was never boring and it never felt like you were in the middle of an ocean while traveling to the destinations.
St Maarteen was absolutely beautiful as well as we did enjoy the other destinations.
I felt like they could of had more adult partys at night, but their were many night clubs and bars to attend.
The dinner and staff was terrific every night. We ate all our dinners in the main Dining Room, then second captains night had laobster tail on the menu and they were great in size and not small at all. One thing was there was not that great of a dessert choice fot eh chocolate lovers on the main dining room menu as well as the buffets.
We also found the lunch in the Main Dining room to be outstanding, as it was a create your own salad bar prepared by the staff for you with whatever you wanted in it along with a small buffet of different main entrees which was a nice break from the Windjammer buffet.
Breakfast was great, Johhny Rockets had a great breakfast at no cahrge, we enjoyed the fact that you could have snacks during the day and late at night such as pizza and tiny sandwiches at different restaurants.We indulged in the drink package which I am not sure was make or break for us, I have seen that if you drink 9 drinks a day you come out ahead, but sometimes it was hard to get 9 drinks in a day with going off the ship at the ports, but it was no hassle getting a drink and not having to sign for each drink was great. One thing to keep i n mind is that with the drink package you alread pay for the gratuities so if you dont purchase the drink package then you ahve a gratuitie added each time you purchase a beverage which to me would add up very easily.
We had a balcony room over looking Central park which was nice but next time I will pay a bit more for a ocean view room.
It was amazing that bartenders, wait staff along with the stateboard attendant remember you and called you by name eachtime they saw you, one time my husband went to the On Air bar and got a drink and a few days later he went back and the bartender remembered him and called him by name, he was in disbelief that he did that it.
So with all this being said, it was a great time and great fun with friends on the Oasis of the sea and we will definetly go again in the near future."
5.0	Sail Date: Sep 07, 2013 /	Excellent!  We had a experience!  Ship clean, love the dining,  I we returning. Were trying to plan a notjer cruise for next with other son and others and planing on booking with cruise line only
5.0	Sail Date: Aug 31, 2013 /	This is the second time that we have taken this same cruise. It was everything that it could be. Other family members joined us on this cruise. Some of the family members had never cruised before and was in amazement of the ships size and offerings of same.
5.0	Sail Date: Aug 31, 2013 /	This I think by far was the best cruise my friends a I have been on. Everything good that was said about the ship was true and more. I hope I can get to do this again. Thank You Royal Caribbean.
4.0	Sail Date: Aug 31, 2013 /	I really enjoyed this cruise. Had everything I needed.  The entertainment was  spectacular..  My only complaint is passengers smoking on the balconies. I couldn't fully enjoy my balcony because of the smokers on both sides of me. I came on this cruise to totally relax so I wanted to spend most of my time in my room and on my balcony.  Because of the smoking, I couldn't. I lung issues and I thought these were not designated areas.  Other than that, which really was an issue for me, the cruise itself was great!!!
2.0	Sail Date: Aug 31, 2013 /	"We recently sailed on a 7 day Eastern Caribbean Cruise on the largest cruse ship on the seas, with 6,200 passengers and 2,500 crew members. We are in our 60's and felt that the ships activities, choice of music heard throughout many parts of the ship was oriented to a much younger grouping. There were many children on board, often exploring without parental guidance. Getting off an elevator was often a challenge with the rush of those trying to get on. We frequently had to wait, travel either up or down to get to our floor and try again.
There were many on board with coughs and sniffles. The banisters on the stairwell were often sticky and the tables in the buffet area were seen dry wiped with the last passengers table napkins. This adds to the spread of illness through the passengers.
The dining and housekeeping staff was exceptional! 
This is our second cruise on Royal Caribbean and will be our last. Friends had encouraged us to try again, hence this recent cruise. We will happily return to Holland America; a different group of passengers, more intellectual based activities offered, great libraries and a more calm atmosphere. All of the above better meet our needs."
5.0	Sail Date: Aug 31, 2013 /	A beautiful ship . Lots to go can't wait to go back !!! Food is Excellent & staff is friendly !! Central park was one of our favorite so nice having a park to go to in the middle of the ocean :)
4.0	Sail Date: Aug 24, 2013 /	WHile my trip was great the shopping was from diamonds international was misleading and to long to sit thought only cheated by them and the stores.  The so called diamond bracelets that James spoke so highly of was junk that changed colors after my daughter wore it for 2 days.  If the price tag on the jewerly is so high to being with what is the real price of the jewerly when they not it down to more then half price?  One needs to really think about what is really going on hear.   my helment dive was the biggest waist of money for what they did there wasn't anything to see down there so the only experince was just being under water with the helmet on.  7days is not enough time to enjoy the oasis of the sea the and the time spendit in the islands was way to shore the high light is my daughter had a wonerful with all the actives they had lined up for her and all the new friend that she ment.  Ms Green from your staff and (others )were excellents with the infor that she gave me. thank you for the wonderful cruise Ms. Johnson
4.0	Sail Date: Aug 24, 2013 /	"Enjoyed the overall cruise. 
*Disappointed in St. Thomas as a shopping port. Not as clean nor colorful in Charlotte Amalie. Now just another Caribbean port - they are not keeping up the downtown area. Beaches are still naturally beautiful.
*Ship offers loads to do - necessary to make advance reservations for shows and  re$taurant$+. 
 *Mytime dining tablemates never the same due to other competing restaurants so social interaction does not develop easily. Show times and premium dining reservations redirect schedules and alter the daily dining schedule. 
*Giovanni's was very good -dining outside in Central Park.
* Great for multi-generational family gatherings as ship offers many neighborhoods, parades and different activities.
* Lots of children at this time of year and travelers from different nations are represented as the ship is an attraction in itself. 
*  Oasis of the seas is fascinating engineering  and will satisfy those looking for an extra - the Royal Promenade - a mall- at- sea, a shoppers delight !
The music at the Globe Bar was very good in the evenings."
5.0	Sail Date: Aug 24, 2013 /	We chose to go on the Oasis of the Seas because of the size of the ship and all the amenities it had to offer.  We were not disappointed.  The variety of shows, the quality of the shows, the times you could choose to go; all made it very appealing.  We loved Central Park, the Boardwalk and the Promenade.  It was just like being in a very modern little city with so much to see and do.  The crew were all very friendly and did an excellent job of whatever their job was.  We would definitely go back on the Oasis of the Seas; and definitely cruise with Royal Caribbean.  Highly recommend it.
5.0	Sail Date: Aug 17, 2013 /	There are no dislikes about the Oasis! They have something for everyone. The oasis has several areas for adults to relax with or without kid. The shows are amazing ( per-registered). Everyone was very helpful and polite. Most of our pictures were taken by the crew (any one passing by) they did not mind and took great photos. We loved it!
4.0	Sail Date: Aug 17, 2013 /	The ship was beautiful with lots to do all the time. The entertainment, food and service was outstanding. The only thing I would change would be to add another port of call and take away one day at sea.
5.0	Sail Date: Aug 10, 2013 /	Ship was great.  the crew was very friendly and helpful. ship was clean.  food was great.  lots to do!  fun for all. the whole family went and enjoyed themselves.  we are now diamond plus members and this was a very different experience than the smaller ships.  loved it and cant wait to go on Allure.
5.0	Sail Date: Aug 10, 2013 /	"I have been on many R.C. ships. This is by far its best.
The ship holds over 6000 passangers but it never was a problem.
The specialty resturants were well worth the cover charges.
The entertainment was good, but similar to their other ships.
The activities were plentiful. Not enough time to do everything which makes it
enough choices to have fun.
The availability of pool chairs was never a problem.

Good Job, Royal Caribbean!!!"
4.0	Sail Date: Aug 03, 2013 /	The ship was clean and inviting to families with children of all ages. I only have one complaint. the dream works characters (i.e. Shrek, Fiona and puss in boots). Had the meet and greet in front of a bar that reeked of cigarette and cigar smoke.
5.0	Sail Date: Aug 03, 2013 /	"this ship is a MUST for every person that loves cruises such as my family and I. we just loved it!
a lot of great shows, great pools, my grandchildren loved the circle crystal one!. the food was excellent! my wife loved the casino, the dreamworks characters provided a nice environment and interaction with the entire family.
the cabins we got were excellent, a lot of space, clean and excellent TV entrainment too! all the news, children programs.

the ship is amazing and has activities for all age groups, that is probably why we met people from so many countries and backgrounds!

Congrats to Royal Caribbean!"
5.0	Sail Date: Jul 27, 2013 /	This was our first cruise on Royal Caribbean. We have been on Carnival a couple times. Oasis of the Sea's was a fun and fantastic ship!! HUGH!!! There is something to do for everyone! There is something to eat for everyone!!(24 hrs) Plenty of pools. Salt water pools on one side of the ship and fresh water on the other side. All staff whether room attendants to the restaurant servers they were all great. Happy and funny!! They made you feel welcomed! They will do just about anything to make you happy!! The shows were spectacular! We saw most of them. They are a lot like Cirque du Soleil with the music and the choreography. The ship was always clean! Inside and out. The food was excellent! If you liked something say so and you will have 2 of them. My wife said she loves lobster and the next thing we knew she had 2 plates with lobster. I couldn't figure out a dessert one night(they were all that good) so they brought everything!! We ate everything!! Again all staff at pools, bars and sporting(zip line, basketball,etc) were very helpful and appreciative of you. Went with our 17 yr old son and 22 yr old daughter. They had a blast! Great ship! Great Staff! Great time!!! Looking to book our next trip!! Ship going into dry dock soon for renovations. They do it every 5 years.  Do get on this ship. You will have a fantastic time!!!
5.0	Sail Date: Jul 27, 2013 /	This was one of the best vacations ever and we travel a lot (every 3 months).  It was the third time on a royal Caribbean cruise and the fourth cruise I've done.  My husband and I renewed our vows and my mother celebrated her birthday on this cruise.  The service was the best.  There were so many place to eat at. So much to do.  The only draw back was the rooms are really small.  We had a balcony room and the three of us were tight in that room (hasband, daughter (7) and I) If it was just the two of us it would be fine.  Also we did the my time and made reservations but they would that the people without faster then our reservation line.  I still like the food on my carnival cruise....
4.0	Sail Date: Jul 20, 2013 /	The ship is beautiful. The food was very good and the stateroom service was promptly taking care of. The only thing I found the stateroom were small for a family of 4. But amenities and activities on board, especially the shows were excellent. I definitly recommend it. And I actually planning to come back in 2 years for my daughter's sweet sixteen. We loved Amy, the cruise director. She really has a lot of energy and was very enthusiastic and concern about our enjoyment on the cruise. Thank you Amy!! We had a wonderful time!
4.0	Sail Date: Jul 20, 2013 /	When I met our stateroom attendent he basically told me that the room I had reserved was only for 2 people and the loveseat did not pull out.  I was very embarassed as we had our 12 year old grandson with us and he had no BED.  The attendent should have had that setup for 3 people before I arrived.  We only had 2 glasses, and 2 sets of towels and one bed!
4.0	Sail Date: Jul 20, 2013 /	"The ship is really beautiful and the crew very attentive and helpful.
The rooms clean and no complains there.
The casino unbearable with smoke odor (splitting the room makes no difference)...don't you ever learn?!
The food a disappointing experience. Very Asiatic theme that even though is great once in a while, everyday tires. At one point dinner time they served leftovers from the night before. It is understandable to try saving but we are paying good money and deserve better.
I would choose the Allure anytime against the Oasis."
5.0	Sail Date: Jul 13, 2013 /	This was my first cruise and it was wonderful.  The ship was huge and had something for all ages.  There were so many activities that you had to decide what you wanted to do and know that you couldn't do everything.  I would recommend this to anyone!!
5.0	Sail Date: Jul 13, 2013 /	"We had such a great time on this cruise.  We have cruised with Royal Caribbean several times before and this ship is by far the best one.  There was so much to do and see on the Oasis.  I especially loved ""Central Park"" area of the ship.  It was quiet and relaxing.  Another favorite was the large round chairs in the Solarium.  It is at the very front of the ship and a nice place to relax and have a fabulous view.  There were all kinds of nook and crannies to get lost and relax in.  
     The food was average.  Had to wait an excessive amount of time for dinner 2 of the nights.  We did Anytime Dining so I don't know if that made a difference or not. The dining staff was wonderful just got backed up a couple of times. The food in the Windjammer and Park Cafe were delicious.  I didn't try the restaurants that required reservations but heard several passengers comment that they were very good.
     The shows we saw were great.  The ice show was a bit cheesy but the headliner was so good!! The comedy show is one you don't want to miss. 
     Overall, a wonderful ship and experience!!"
5.0	Sail Date: Jul 06, 2013 /	"My husband and I have cruised many times so it it not novel to us....but the OASIS was! It's big, beautiful, bountiful, and the service was so good, we thought we were on Celebrity!
Didn't love the excursions, but loved the OASIS so much it almost didn't matter. 
You can get a balcony overlooking the ocean or boardwalk, or Central Park.  We had Boardwalk and although there were fun things about it, it was much too noisy. Next time we will chose a balcony that overlooks beautiful Central Park.  Bear in my that balconies at either location are not private.  If private is what you want, do Oceanside."
5.0	Sail Date: Jun 29, 2013 /	"I've never been so sad for a vacation to end!  What a dream this 7-day cruise was.  It was the perfect vacation for a larger family, with plenty of options to for everyone (more than could be taken in, really).  At times I felt like I was living in a sci-fi movie being aboard this floating city.  From this experience, we are hooked on cruising and big Royal Caribbean fans.  We are already planning to go for another 7 day cruise in 6 months.

Staterooms
Balcony Stateroom on deck 14, forward  -- beautiful room, incredible view, zero complaints.  Loved our deck.  Our family had a total of 4 adjoining rooms and the crew was able to remove the intermediary screens between our rooms.  This made us feel like we had a suite & increased the angle of the view from our balcony.  

Restaurants
Windjammer Cafe (Included) - great selection, no lines, casual clothes (shorts), probably the best restaurant on the ship if traveling with young children, tired, hungover, etc.... good place to get in and out and grab some comfort food.
Izumi Sushi ($) - Limited sushi selection, but what was available was fresh & tasty; great saki options
Chops Grill ($) - THE BEST.  Fillet Mignon all the way.
Giovanni's Table ($) - Delicious, and way too much food.  Order half of what they suggest you should order.  I did gain 4 pounds on this trip!
My Time Dining @ Opal Dining Room - We only ate here twice!!  And paid a lot for the ""my time"" option.  There are so many other places to eat, even if you are not planning on choosing the extra ($) options.  We know better now not to waste the money on ""my time"".  I think we only went there twice because it was LOUD, the wait for a table was still 10-15 minutes, the food was good but not great, and the average dining time was 1 1/2 - 2 hours.  This is a huge, 3 level open dining area with no windows on the My Time floor.  It was so noisy that my dad, who uses hearing aids, couldn't hear a thing, and I felt like I was shouting at the person seated next to me.
Wipe Out Cafe - My husband loved this place because the wait time was zero and he could go there in a swimsuit.  I spent 1 1/2 hrs at the Opal Dining room for waffles one morning, only to find out they offered waffles at Wipe Out in the buffet line the next morning!  Good quick options, more kid-friendly options as well.
Sarrento's - nothing fancy about this place, but it's free, and it's open until something ridiculous like 2 AM.  It would be a great whiny kid stop during the day and an even better drunk adult stop late at night.  Takes like 10 seconds to get as much pizza as you want.
Room Service - We did this option for breakfast most mornings.  The food was cold sometimes and the coffee wasn't very tasty, but the luxury of having food delivered made up for it!  Good option for mornings when you are on a schedule.
Solarium Bistro-- I think this is supposed to be the healthy food option.  Not very appetizing.  Ate there twice, confused both times.

Bars
Viking Crown Lounge - Ah I miss this place.  Beautiful couches/seating, great view at the top level of the ship, great martinis, nice piano/violin live music, and the only place on the ship besides our room that was nice and QUIET.
Boleros - It was one the smoking areas on the ship (I guess?)... so we didn't spend much time there.
Saxon Pub - Nice pub, crazy expansive beer selection.  We hung out and played card there one afternoon and it was a great time.  Downside to this bar is it's in the royal promenade, so it's more like being in a mall or Vegas than being on a ship (no exterior views).
Other Bars - there are tons of bars everywhere, and tons of bar servers walking around offering you drinks.  It is harder to find water on this ship than it is to find alcohol.  
Other note on alcohol:  it's reasonably priced.  Cocktails and 12 oz. frozen/mixed drinks are all around $8/drink.

Ports of Call
Nassau, Bahamas - Ghetto!!  Highly recommend you go to Atlantis, Paradise Island or other beach getaway, or don't get off the boat at all.  We did the Forts & Pirates tour.  The Pirate Museum was actually quite cool, especially if you like that stuff, but the forts & bus ride around the city was pretty lame.  Going to the pirate museum alone is $12 I think, and the forts & pirates excursion was $39/ticket.  I think we could've saved $27.
St. Thomas - We did the Christmas Cove/Honeymoon Beach snorkel excursion for $99/ticket.  It took up the whole day so I can't really comment on St. Thomas (didn't spend any time walking around the island).  This was a good day & pretty par for the course if you've done any excursions on other vacations.  We did see sea turtles while snorkeling, the water is super clear & beautiful.  The boat ride to Christmas Cove * Honeymoon Beach was nice, lunch was good - higher quality than I was expecting, and the beach afternoon was short but sweet.  It was very very good relaxing/lazy day in a beautiful spot and worth the $.
St. Maarten - This was my favorite port.  It crossed my mind a few times to hide, not go back to the ship and just live on the island for the rest of my life.  It was like being in paradise.  I've never seen bright turquoise water like that before.  We rented a minivan and explored the island for the day.  It is small enough that you can drive the whole perimeter, stop along the way, and get back in time.  We stopped at Maho Beach, a couple shopping areas, and Dawn Beach.  We found Dawn Beach by accident and I'm so glad we did.  That is THE place to go.  It's got a hamburger stand/bar, some lounge chairs, the prettiest beach ever, and nothing else.  This was a really great day and also fun & not scary to be out on our own.  I enjoyed a day away from the big groups of other tourists.

On-Board Activities
Rock Climbing - Very fun, challenging walls.  I did this 3 or 4 times.  I recommend you get there early and pay attention to when the wall is open.  Best time to go is 9-10 AM.  The lines for this were pretty ridiculous in the afternoons.
Zipline - It's about a 3 second zip line!  I did this twice, also early in the morning before the long lines started forming.  If you want to do it, do it once and check it off your list... it's too short to be much of a thrill.
Wave/Tide/Surf thing - Sorry, I forgot the name of it.  I did the surf board one once and the boogie board once.  It was fun, and worth the wait in line.  Very similar to a water park type activity.  It's free, unless you want a private lesson.  I didn't get to it until the last day of the cruise, otherwise I probably would've done this more.  It is also fun to watch people surf & they have shaded stands where you can hang out and watch.
Pools - The 4 main pools, while huge, with hundreds & hundreds of lounge chairs are crazy crowded during at-sea days.  I spent zero time there & LOTS of time in the Solarium instead.
Solarium pool - Incredible views, great atmosphere, with 1 small pool and 2 hot tubs.  It's perfect for people who want to mostly lounge in a quieter environment and have a pool nearby to dip in when hot.  Poolside/lounge chair drink service is available as there are tons of servers around.

Nighttime Entertainment
Oasis of Dreams Water Show - Yes, very good, go see.  Aerialists, Divers, water dancers.  Awesome pool with hydraulic floor.  Great show.
Headliner Kenny James - Very good entertainer, fun time.  Family friendly/probably super popular with the older crowd
Ice Skating Show - Loved this too.  Very talented group, cool costumes, and there is a special guest that blew us all away.

There is a bunch more to say but I'm out of time.  I hope my review helps you navigate your own time on Oasis!  We loved it and can't wait to go back!"
4.0	Sail Date: Jun 29, 2013 /	I chose this rating because the cruise was great.  Ship was amazingly huge!  Never felt that we waited long for things.  We did try my time dining.  Enjoyed the flexibility--but missed the personalized service of the same wait staff each evening.  Entertainment was excellent--lots of it and great quality.
5.0	Sail Date: Jun 29, 2013 /	I had one of the most best excellent. Everyone on the ship very nice and made feel like i was home. It was ever thing me I excit and more. Thank you so very much. I will taking a cruise next year.
5.0	Sail Date: Jun 15, 2013 /	"My daughter and I went on the Oasis June 15th 2013 for a 7 Night eastern carribean cruise and everything was wonderful.
It started with embarking on the ship and everything was handled so smoothly and efficiently. I can aslo say the debarkation was also done very well.I was told our cruise was at full capacity whicj is over 6,000 people and never once did we feel that so many people were on the ship.There was never any major crowds and the elevators cam very quickly and they were never really full.
The staff,service,shows,food...everything was fantastic!
I would definetly reccomend this ship...thank you RCL for making our vacation so wonderful."
5.0	Sail Date: Jun 08, 2013 /	"I completed this cruise on June 15th. I really had a wonderful time. I was with a group of friends celebrating a 70th Birthday. 
I got to see my youngest sister in Jamaica, and that was a real treat. 
We all enjoyed the meals, the day in Haiti, and your wonderful staff. 
I hated to come home, but I will remember this voyage for the rest of my life.

3.0	Sail Date: Jun 08, 2013 /	The ship was beautiful, room attendant (Simone) amazing, shows were fabulous, kids club was fun, but the upcharges and food were disappointing.  As an example, a glass of fresh squeezed orange juice was $2.00-REALLY.  Too many tables squeezed into the dining room, the food did not meet our expectations and the waiters were not friendly so we spent the extra $135 and finished out the cruise in specialty restaurants which were close to the same level as Disney's dining room.  No regrets, as we always wanted to sail the Oasis of  the seas-so we can now say we did, but it was not worth the 3 hours drive to the ship.  We will continue to only sail out of Port Canaveral which is a 10 minuite drive.
5.0	Sail Date: Jun 08, 2013 /	All cruise ships boast of being beautiful and loaded with activities and entertainment, but the Oasis of the Sea is in a category all by itself.  From a wonderful boardwalk to a list of activities it is unsurpassed on the seas.  However, no matter how great the entertainment, how wonderful the food ( and it was ) the friendliness and courtesy of the crew are the mainstays of Royal Caribbean and the crew of the Oasis of the Seas is superior in even for Royal Caribbean's standards.
5.0	Sail Date: Jun 01, 2013 /	Ship was very nice, everything was new.  Service was great.  Really enjoyed all the different resturants outside the main dining.  We bought the drink package which is the way to go.
3.0	Sail Date: May 25, 2013 /	The food was not as good as Holland America, I am unhappy with your company because when I talked to Cruise.com about sailing dates and pricing with you they made the reservation with out my knowladge and the next day you had a $200 rebate per room and we did nor qualifly even though we did not  pay until 4-days later, we will go back to Holland America next time. We have gone on 20 cruises.
4.0	Sail Date: May 25, 2013 /	"I really enjoyed my cruise on oasis of the seas,the crew treated us like they were making our stay enjoyable ,fun and worry free and not as if they were just ""at work"". There were plenty of things for you to do whether you wanted to or not. I do suggest a little side cut off on the daily planner because I didn't want to walk around with that big paper."
5.0	Sail Date: May 18, 2013 /	This cruise was absolutely fabulous.  It truly amazed me how organized it was with 8000 people on board.  The service was terrific, ship clean and activities were great.  Shows were spectacular and the food was delicious.  The service at Giovanni's was superb.
5.0	Sail Date: May 18, 2013 /	"Fantastic Cruise!!!  Enjoyed....
1)  Quality Entertainment - Comedy Shows, Musical, Aquatics, etc..
2)  Entire Staff - From cabin steward to My Dining waiters.  Looked forward to dinner every evening.  The staff made you feel special, catered to your every need and very professional/personable.
3)  All events were well organized including embarking and disembarking phase of cruise.
4)  Had lots of fun on the shore excursions that were offered through Royal Caribbean."
5.0	Sail Date: May 18, 2013 /	This was my wife and I second cruise on royal Caribbean and we loved them both! Oasis was unbelievable! So much to do and ports were great. We really enjoyed the food and the solarium which was peaceful with it being 16 and older. This was our five year anniversary cruise and baby on board(20 weeks). All about relaxing and this was the perfect ship for that. Can't wait to plan a family cruise in the next few years. There is plenty to do to keep kids entertained for sure with the dreamworks theme. I would definitely recommend this trip and we keep telling each other can we just go back to the boat!
5.0	Sail Date: May 04, 2013 /	The ship was everything I had heard it was.  Great service, excellent food and all staff were very nice and friendly.  Was expressed with the cleanlineses of the entire ship.  My only drawback was the costs of the pictures. Lots of activities, entertainment.  My only drawback was the costs of pictures.  If the cost was less, passengers would buy more pictures.  RC wold make money from volume sales.  I will try your sister ship (Allure) for my next cruise.  Thanks for a great trip.
5.0	Sail Date: May 04, 2013 /	"First time on a larges ship like this.  It was amazing to see how so many people were accommodated in such a professional manner.  The food, entertainment, and all services were performed by persons who were anxious to please.  Will definitely sail again with RCL and will not hesitate to recommend it to our friends.

5.0	Sail Date: May 04, 2013 /	"This was my husband and my first cruise so we chose the biggest ship in the world of course.
Everything was so easy and ran so smooth from getting transportation from our hotel to the terminal. 
The entertainment is fabulous Ricky is the best activities director ever! The shows are top notch.
We took a tour of the Bahamas, St. Thomas and St. Martin which we felt very safe and truly enjoyed our excursions.
There are endless things to do all day long from morning to night you will never be bored not unless you want to be.
We chose My Time Dining and we enjoyed the restaurants that were available to us to eat at. There was such array of food to choose from. 
Our housekeeper Lily kept our room clean twice a day and always had a bucket of ice available to me which I requested.
The crew on board went way out of their way to help you in anyway that they can to make your vacation the best it could be.
I would like to take my next cruise again on the Oasis of the Seas, but this time I would like to try the Western Caribbean. 
A week really isn't long enough to explore all the things that are available to you while on vacation."
4.0	Sail Date: May 04, 2013 /	Recently completed an Eastern Caribbean Cruise aboard the Oasis of the Seas (4-11 May 2013).  It's a Great Ship.  Mostly five stars for entertainment and ship amenities.  Lots to do aboard this huge vessel.  Four stars for food.  It was good, but not above average.  We booked the Aqua Suite for our group of four.  Be prepared for long walks from the stairs/elevator, but we knew that when we booked. The two bedrooms/two bathrooms worked well for our puposes.  It was nice to watch several shows at the Aqua Theater from the comfort of our balcony.  However, I expected better service/treatment. This was my ninth cruise, mostly on RCCL.  I usually book a smaller stateroom with balcony.  We got a suite this time to celebrate (treat ourselves).  The level of service in the suite was no better and we received no preferential booking treatment for any shows.  I'm not trying to sound like a snob, but for $12K, one would expect something more than you get in a $3K stateroom.  The one advantage in a suite is the use of the conceigre lounge and free alcohol for two hours a day, but still not making up fully for the difference in price.  I will travel RCCL again, just not in a high-end suite.  Didn't see the cost versus benefit plusses.  I really like the bigger ships - been on both the Oasis and Allure.  Recommend both ships!  Bon Voyage!
5.0	Sail Date: May 04, 2013 /	Having Cruised at least 6 other times before I can say this by far has been the best cruise experience! Even though the airline lost my luggage (Air Tran, on a non-stop direct flight) Royal Caribbean made this vacation a dream!  One would think a ship of this magnitude would be impersonal and you'd be a number. That is so far from the case! Even with over 6,000 guest you never felt crowded. The wait staff and service was great and always attentive.  I can't wait to cruise the sister ship.
5.0	Sail Date: Apr 27, 2013 /	"This Was Our 10Th Cruise And I Have To This The Best Ship I Was Ever On. The Activities Were Amazing.It Has So Much To Do  You Can't Do It All . Thats The Good, But With The Good There Always Something Bad.

The Guest Services Staff Was Ok  But There Were 2 Times With 2 Different Agents That Were Nasty With An I Don't Care AnswerS. That Was The Only Bad Part Of This Wonderful Ship."
5.0	Sail Date: Apr 27, 2013 /	Excellent experience.  Have not cruised in 3 years, since cruising to Alaska, as we found it to be too confined and long.  One week was just enough.  Great Cruise Liner, staff, lots to do.
5.0	Sail Date: Apr 13, 2013 /	This may have been our first cruise..but it will absolutely not be our last.  Royal caribbean is the ONLY way to go for the best of everything involved with a great cruise experience.   Virtually eyeryone we met and talked to also said the same thing...many of them have been on other cruise lines but like RC lines the best.   You can not go wrong with the Oasis....
4.0	Sail Date: Apr 13, 2013 /	We had an amazing time on oasis of the seas we can not wait to do it again EVERYTHING was fantastic starting with the room our room steward Jack was great he took care of all our needs, our waiter Larry was great as well if we had a show after dinner he made sure our meal was brought out quickly,the shows we're fantastic,again everything was great I don't have one complaint.
3.0	Sail Date: Apr 06, 2013 /	"The Oasis of the Seas is a beautiful, very large ship.  We enjoyed having the balcony overlooking Central Park rather than just looking out over the ocean.  There were no problems dispersing over 6,000 people throughout the ship for meals, shows, etc.

One area of concern we had is the food.  Dining room food left a lot to be desired.  Meals were small is some cases, sometimes could not find anything ""normal"" to choose from, and you could not get any beef (prime rib, steak) item cooked any way other than well done or almost well done.  Even when we ordered medium rare, it still came out almost well done.  Service in dining room also was lacking.  The main head waiter needed more help.  She was doing most everything by herself; bus boy person seemed to not be much help.

Buffet food choices were terrible.  One day, I went through the entire lunch buffet and came back with an empty plate.  Had to settle for a salad, which was OK, but ranch dressing was so watered down it didn't have much taste.

Sorrentos pizza was very good.  Other than the food issues, cruise was enjoyable and the ship was nice."
4.0	Sail Date: Mar 30, 2013 /	"The reason I did not give it a 5-star was the entertainment reservation was not good. I reserved all events 3 months before sail date. My entertainment reservations were bumped twice. Which means I had to go to 2 back-to-back shows for 2 nights. Then when I showed up at one scheduled reservation, I was told that I did not have a reservation for that night. The next day, I had to talk to guest services and they told me I should've talked to them the moment I was denied entry (how would I know to do that ?). Then guest services rebooked me to a make-up show, which was the last night of the cruise. The show was crappy.

Besides that, everything else was great. The activities, personnel, events, services were all excellent."
5.0	Sail Date: Mar 30, 2013 /	The quality of the ship is superior.  You never feel like you are on a boat even when you are in rough waters (which we had).  The staff goes out of their way to make everything exceptional.  The only port I did not really enjoy was Haiti - the beach was small with that amount of people and the water sort of stagnant.  The food served there was good but they need to have covers on the food as flies were landing on the cheese etc... Also, they ran out of food and silverware packages.  Throughly enjoyed Jamaica and Cozumel ports.  Wish we were told that each adult was allowed to bring on 2 bottles of wine before we arrived at the cruise terminal.  This is our second cruise with the first being the eastern caribbean on the Oasis.  I would be hard pressed to go on anything smaller than this size of ship.
5.0	Sail Date: Mar 16, 2013 /	"We have cruised before, also on other cruise lines, but RCCL is really our favorite.
Oasis of the Seas was on our bucket list and we decided to celebrate our 10th wedding anniversary on this ship.
In one word.... UNBELIEVABLE!
So much to do and see, shows where great. Entertainment all over the ship was great. Sports deck was our favorite, as on other ships the basketball/golf area is always a bit hidden away on the front of the ship, but on the Oasis this is well done.......lots of things happening there!  
The only thing that was badly organized, was the towel stations on the pool deck. Every time we would go get our towels we would have to stand in line as there was only 1 of the stations open. (for 6000+ guests?).
The My time dining and the 2 seatings (6.00pm and 8.30pm) is not well organized in our opinion, as we experienced waiting lines on the My time dining every time we went for diner. With or without reservations. But with all the dining opportunities on the ship you can always choose something else. 
We will definitely cruise again and definitely with RCCL."
5.0	Sail Date: Mar 16, 2013 /	This was my 6th cruise and my 2nd Royal Carribean. I have been on 3 other cruise lines but I like Royal Carribean the best. The Oasis was an amazing ship it had something for every age to do all day or night. The food was amazing and the shows were out of this world. I especially loved the fact that they had a starbucks on board. I thought for how big the ship was and how many crew and passengers would be sailing with us that it would be crowded but I never felt crowded and we sat front row for all the shows. Also I loved the layout of the ship it was the easiest to get around on. Other ships half its size that I have been on seems like your walking forever to get to where you need to go but the way they designed the Oasis was perfect. I also loved central park, all the plants were beautiful and it felt very peaceful there. All around this was the best cruise that I have been on and this is the best cruise line and ship. I would recommend Royal Carribean and the Oasis of the seas to everyone all ages.
5.0	Sail Date: Mar 02, 2013 /	We were very happy with the Oasis of the seas.  We have been sailing with RCCL for many years and taken friends and many family members cruising with us.  We like the benefits of being diamond members.
4.0	Sail Date: Mar 02, 2013 /	It was a great time! The food, entertainment, and staff was awesome as usual!! There weren't as many ports as some of the other Royal Caribbean cruises I've been on - would have preferred more ports and Southern Caribbean so doing that next year.  Also, it would be nice if there was some sort of land & sea package offered in the Caribbean...where you cruise but are able to stay in one of the ports for an extended period of time. I looked but didn't see anything in the Caribbean (only in Alaska and in Hawaii).
4.0	Sail Date: Mar 02, 2013 /	Overall fantastic experience.  Great weather, lots of friendly staff members, and tons of activity on the ship.  We especially loved our stateroom attendant, who went by Utama (his last name).  Only staff members we were not impressed with were the bartenders at the pool bars.
5.0	Sail Date: Mar 02, 2013 /	"My husband and I enjoyed our cruise very much.  The weather was not as nice
as it has been on our other cruises.  The food was excellent and the servers
were outstanding.

I did experience some rudeness from a server in the Park Cafe.  He seemed
unwilling to fill my soda pass container.  I finally had my husband go  get it
filled for me.  This happened three times.  My husband missed having a clock in
the room.

We have already signed up for a cruise for next year."
5.0	Sail Date: Mar 02, 2013 /	Let me start by saying that in general I am not a fan of cruising.  This ship is amazing!  So much to see and do.  Could not possible be bored... on board!  The ship is all they say it is and then some.  The staff is great!  Amy the cruise director is awesome as was every staff member we encountered.  All of the shows we saw were excellent.  The Hairspray performance was broadway caliber.   The headliner show (Vox Audio) was very entertaining and quite unique.  The comedy show was hilarious.  The food in the dining room was good and the buffet breakfast and lunch were really good also.  Very good variety, well breakfast was pretty much the same everyday though.  Chops Grille was excellent!  The only thing that annoyed me on the ship was the wifi price/availability.  I don't think they should charge at all or at least have a time period and or area where wifi was available.  There are quite a few food options that you have to pay extra for, like the seafood shack on the boardwalk and the cupcake shop.  Also, the picture prices are pretty steep.  I bet they would sell wayyy more pictures if the prices were more reasonable, $20 for one 8x10 is a lot in my book.
5.0	Sail Date: Mar 02, 2013 /	We have cruised many times before (and on several different cruise lines), and we would highly reccomend the Oasis.  The ship is amazing - always things to do!  We were very impressed with the entertainment!!!  All of the shows were top quality.
4.0	Sail Date: Feb 23, 2013 /	My wife and I just returned from a 7 day eastern caribbean cruise on Royal Caribbean's Oasis of the Seas. Overall we were very pleased. The ship is not only enormous but also beautiful. We had a Deck 12 Junior Suite about midship and loved the room. Even though the JS does not come with full Suite perks the larger room, bath with tub, bigger balcony, and walk-in closet made it worth it to us. Our stateroom attendant, Mike, was exceptional. In fact, all crew we encountered were friendly and helpful. Food ranged from merely good in the Windjammer buffet to excellent in the high end specialty venues. Where they lost a star was also in the size of the ship. Even though the ship is enormous you are cruising with over 6,000 other people when the ship is at full capacity. Crowds are unavoidable and at times the elevators cannot cope even though there are 24 of them available for passengers. Still, the times when  the ship felt overcrowded were rare. My wife and I are planning a western caribbean cruise on the Oasis, or possibly the Allure, for sometime next year.
4.0	Sail Date: Feb 23, 2013 /	An amazing cruise ship.  So many things to do.  Entertainment was excellent.  The best part is we actually fogot we were on a ship.  A truely great vacation.
4.0	Sail Date: Feb 16, 2013 /	"We had a lovely time. We did have a balcony cabin facing the park on the eleventh deck. There was constant noise from the pools on the fifteenth deck sometimes late 
into the night.The next time we will choose an ocean view cabin."
5.0	Sail Date: Feb 16, 2013 /	Oasis was fabulous -- so much to do, great service, excellent food!  We couldn't always count on the weather, but we could count on the ship and Royal Caribbean! Would definitely cruise again on Oasis or its sister ship, Allure. The production of Hairspray was great, as was the Aqua show. Cruise was enjoyed by all three generations of my family.
4.0	Sail Date: Feb 16, 2013 /	Great ship. Service was wonderful and tons to do on the boat. Lots of choices in terms of the food. A bit crowded with all the kids out for the President's day holiday and often felt like cattle being pushed out. Overall, excellent experience.
5.0	Sail Date: Feb 16, 2013 /	We had an absolutely fabulous time on the Oasis.  Our first time on this ship.  We had been on the Allure twice.  They are very similiar but with different shows which was a nice change.  We saw Hairspray which was excellent.  Loved all the shows.  We missed the diving show because of weather and I do love that one.  Service was wonderful.  We had the best dining room experience.  Our waiters were very entertaining.
4.0	Sail Date: Feb 09, 2013 /	If you can't find something to do - you aren't looking.  The newer stateroom designs give the feeling of a larger room.  The shows and activities on the ship can keep you jumping. The service was top notch! There are a few down sides - the food seems to be subpar - especially the Windjammer = everything has onions in it.  It appears that they are trying to push you towards speciality dining which I think is wrong.  I would like to see some type of visible security - on the Promenade Deck I saw more than once people arguing and pointing fingers - if security was visible perhaps these people would have taken their problems somewhere else.  I would recommend on disembarking to do the express and take your own luggage off - they misplaced our luggage and we had to wait 1 1/2 hours past the time our number was called for our luggage to appear.   We  always take the land tours and as usual the trash on the islands was terrible St. Thomas, St. Maarten- I would love to see the cruise lines band together and state - we won't be coming back till you clean up your island - Mexico is the same way. When we were in port - their were a total of 5 ships - I'm pretty sure it wouldn't take long for the local government to do something about the trash - if the cruise ships didn't come.
5.0	Sail Date: Feb 09, 2013 /	This was the most amazing cruise! everything was top rated! our room was the handicap room that was available at time of booking and it was huge! we were on the 6th deck near the vitality Spa. one floor below on deck 5 all the nightlife activity was so it was easy to come and go. We tried Chops Grille which was a 10+, breakfast at Park Cafe was the best or the windjammer both excellent. we had the Premier Alcohol package so we only left with a Sea Pass Charge of $40.01 ! We added the gratuites to our cruise package also. Bring alot on ones and five dollar bills for tipping porters and bartenders they deserve a little extra. brought too many day clothes all you need is bathing suits and coverups girls...and night outfits..my feet did swell up by day 3 so bring some diurex and comfortable shoes..the food was great, the entertainment the best..we are already saving up to go again!
5.0	Sail Date: Feb 09, 2013 /	Everything you could want in a cruise, we had a group of 12 and we all had a great time.... the only thing I would like to see is a buffet after 12pm.
5.0	Sail Date: Feb 02, 2013 /	There isn't one thing that could have been better !  From the entertainment to the rooms, everything was excellent !  We never experience anyone without a smile or a greeting as you past by. The ship was spotless !   Checking in process was so easy, the disembarkment took longer than anticipated but if you consider getting  6000 people off one ship, it really wasn't that long !   One excursion we could have done without was the experience had while at Jamaica.  I would not recommend the trip to Montego Bay if you are thinking about stopping at Jimmy Buffet's Margueritaville.  The service was terrible - the drinks didn't come for 20 minutes and the food took an additional 40 minutes and then it was only one lunch, the other meal arrived 10 minutes later and then the fish was raw !!!  The waiter had an attitude and even argued with the couple sitting next to us.   That aside, the cruise was amazing !!!
3.0	Sail Date: Feb 02, 2013 /	Fun ship. Can't believe we were at sea. Entertainment great. Amenities awesome. Specialty restaurants a great experience. Main dining-room inconsistent. Windjammer lacks choices available on other RC ships and disorganized.
5.0	Sail Date: Feb 02, 2013 /	This will not be my last time on board the Qasis. I had a great time, loved the ship and I will diffinately recommend this ship and cruise line to anyone.
4.0	Sail Date: Jan 26, 2013 /	"After a little rough start for our friends, who came on Royal Carribean for the very first time we had excellent service and had a wonderful experience. Customer services were ready willing, and able to correct everything. Enjoyed all the amenities of the Concierge Lounge, dinner at Chop's, beautiful breathtaking shows,
The ports were very beautiful, especially St. Maerten. Shops on board the ship and at the ports were exceptional. Would highly recommend either Oasis or Allure of the Seas."
5.0	Sail Date: Jan 26, 2013 /	We booked an inside balcony that overlooked the Boardwalk neighborhood of the Oasis of the Seas.  I was sure if I would like not being able to see the water, but much to my surprise I had a great view of the ocean off the aft of the ship.  Also had a perfect view of the water shoes...a wonderful plus.  We watched something almost every afternoon and night right from our private balcony.  Also participated in a package fine dining deal.  It was awesome, especially enjoyed Chops and 150 Central Park Place.  Giovannis was good too, but we ordered and ate way too much.  Loved this ship!
5.0	Sail Date: Jan 19, 2013 /	just as good as the last time, Central Park is my favorite.  The food was good overall with the Windjammer being at the bottom of the restaurants. The service was very good.  The ship seemed more crowded and with more smokers than in the past. Even with this, the elevator wait was very short.
5.0	Sail Date: Jan 19, 2013 /	"I can't tell you how many times I forgot I was on a ship.  Amazing, AMAZING experience!  I sailed with my husband, two other adult family members, and my five year old son.  I was pleasantly surprised that ALL of the childrens activities are FREE until 10:30 at night. After that, the charge for care is a measley $6.00 per hour.  My son loved the kids adventure area, and even though we only dropped him off a couple times, he wanted to go back every day!  (They even take the kids over for meal times if you happen to be in the middle of something)

The shows are amazing.  I was upset I didn't get to see all of them.  I did see Hairspray, and Come Fly With Me, and honestly? You won't see better, even in Vegas!  I am used to the dumb magic/music shows that I usually see on a cruise ship... these were NOT that!  

The food in the dining hall is wonderful.  My husband ate two meals every night. The steak was cooked perfectly. They had this incredible cold soup (fruit soup, if you can believe that!).  Everything I tried was good.  I didn't dislike a single thing.   The waiter and assistant never forgot to put a small plate of fruit out for my son ( to eat while we waited) and if he fell asleep or couldn't come, my waiter made me a plate of shrimp cocktail to take back to the room, because he knew it was my son's favorite.  Seriously, can you get any better than that??

There was also nothing about the Windjammer food that wasn't YUM!  There was at least five different stations in the Windjammer, serving different ethnic foods.  You could have Chinese, Italian and a nice slab of ham or turkey, all in the same meal! 

This was the best vacation we have taken in the ten years we've been together.  My husband usually hates cruises.  He gets bored, everything is too expensive, too time consuming, not available, too hard to find, etc.  YOU WON'T GET THAT HERE.  You can book your shows and change your reservations from your television in your room.  If you get lost, you touch a large panel next to the elevators, and it will tell you how to find what you're looking for.  

The only thing I can complain about is the Salon. I had the WORST mani/pedi I have ever had (chipped, cracked and peeling within 24 hours).  After having it fixed the first time, I demanded my money back.  I was wasting too much time in there! When I asked for a refund (it was almost $200), I was told by the manger that I could only have 50% refund because ""it looked nice when I got it done, didn't it?"".  I went and complained to Guest Services, and the promptly refunded ALL my money... that made me happy, but I'm still irked that I could have spent that four or five hours finding new things on this INCREDIBLE ship!  

Also, they need to put one of these ships on the West Coast for us!  No fair that Florida gets both of the Oasis class ships! 

We will be back for another go... I'll be sure to book two weeks next time (and no manicures! LOL!)"
5.0	Sail Date: Jan 12, 2013 /	We had a wonderful time.  The Oasis Of The Sea is a beautiful ship.  We would recommend everyone to take a cruise on her.  The staff was fantastic.  Our stateroom server was fantastic.  If and when we go again we hope to get him again
5.0	Sail Date: Dec 22, 2012 /	"Felt like we were in another world. 
Incredible ship. Staff was very friendly and a,ways helpful.
Guest always appeared happy.
I appreciated how they embraced the Christmas holiday."
3.0	Sail Date: Nov 24, 2012 /	I GIVE A 10 RATING
3.0	Sail Date: Nov 10, 2012 /	All three of us were very pleased with the whole experience. We don't know how anyone could expect better! We intend to do it again as soon as we can.
3.0	Sail Date: Nov 10, 2012 /	The ship was amazing! It exceeded our expectations by far. I would recommend this ship to anyone looking to take a wonderful cruise.
4.0	Sail Date: Nov 03, 2012 /	The ship was far better than we had ever expected, and we expected a lot from what we had read and heard.
4.0	Sail Date: Nov 03, 2012 /	This was our first cruise so we did not know what to expect.  We had some expectations as to what it would be like but those expectations went far and beyond what we experienced on our cruise.  The Oasis of the Seas is beautiful and the service was outstanding.  Everyone we came in contact with who worked on the ship were helpful, courteous, caring about us as a traveler.  We will certainly book another cruise in the future.
4.0	Sail Date: Oct 27, 2012 /	"Great ship-massive, but so easy to get around. Touch screens show what to do and how to get there. Staff is always helpful. Lots of elevators. Well laid out so not everyone is in the same place at the same time. Never felt crowded. No long lines for anything. Better than a smaller ship! Amazing for that! Specialty restaurants wonderful. Super super shows! Ship is immaculate! 
We got on board just as hurricane Sandy left and was told it may be a little rough, and I was so anxious because I get so seasick. The ship was so stable, that we didn't feel even the tiniest roll! I didn't even have to take my medication! If felt like we were on land at a luxurious resort!"
3.0	Sail Date: Oct 27, 2012 /	THis was our second cruise and I must say it was a wonderful experience.  The entertainment was the best ever (even compaired to some of the Disney shows). Having a balcony and eating breakfast ever morning with the ocean view was spectacurlar.
3.0	Sail Date: Oct 27, 2012 /	the attendants were all so willing to please us. The food was fabulous.
4.0	Sail Date: Oct 27, 2012 /	great trip. my wife and i had so much fun. bring a lot of cash. better not to use your credit cards.
3.0	Sail Date: Oct 27, 2012 /	A large ship.
4.0	Sail Date: Oct 27, 2012 /	Beautiful LARGE ship. Great Production shows best I have seen of 15 past cruises. Very good food and excellent speciality restaurants.
4.0	Sail Date: Oct 27, 2012 /	The Oasis of the Seas is a beautiful ship with lots to do !  The fact that there were 6,000 people on the ship did not change the experience.  There were no lines for food, waits for beach chairs, etc.
3.0	Sail Date: Oct 27, 2012 /	This is a terrific ship and this was my second cruise on it. The first cruise must have had fewer passengers because I didn't notice the long lines or the crush of people at any events. The entertainment is excellent and I enjoyed the trip despite the overcrowding.
5.0	Sail Date: Oct 20, 2012 /	Great Cruise !!! Even as big as this ship is, it was still easy to move around with all the other passengers, food was outstanding. This was our 9th cruise and the shows and things to do were better than any ship we have every been on. I just can not say enough good things about this ship, the personnel, the capt. and his concern for the passengers. Just OUTSTANDING.
4.0	Sail Date: Oct 20, 2012 /	The ship is amazing, with it's many different amenities & things to do.  There is something going on every minute you are on this massive ship.
5.0	Sail Date: Oct 20, 2012 /	This ship is beautiful and immaculate.  I think it actually shines!  For a first cruise we chose the best!!  Even in the midst of a hurricane (Sandy) it was awesome!!
3.0	Sail Date: Oct 20, 2012 /	Huge! You will get lost if you think you're going in the right direction and you don't need to browse one of the many maps that you'll pass along the way. So much to do, in so little time. You'll never be bored.
5.0	Sail Date: Oct 20, 2012 /	Was my first cruise and have wanted to do one for a long time. Finally had the chance and was blown away, literally.  The staff was helpful and friendly and the shows on board were very well executed and entertaining.  The ship was HUGE and supplied an endless amount of things to while at sea. We actually got caught in Hurricane Sandy and experienced some turbulence but the crew carried on as if normal and I was very comfortable and glad to be on a ship of this magnitude.
4.0	Sail Date: Oct 20, 2012 /	The ship was beautiful and the service was absolutely fantastic. With so many passegers on board the crew handled the crowd perfectly and there were no lines anywhere for food or entertainments. The shows were as good as those in Las Vegas and the cruise director kept everyone entertained and did a great job.
5.0	Sail Date: Oct 20, 2012 /	We had always cruised with Carnival....what a fantastic change.  Such an interesting ship, layout and things to do.  The shows were magnificent.  Our cabin and balcony were great.  Hope to try the sister ship Allure.
4.0	Sail Date: Oct 20, 2012 /	Enjoyed the cruise. Not time for boredom!  Service was excellent.  However, quality of food at the dinning room and Windjammer needs improvement.
3.0	Sail Date: Oct 13, 2012 /	"The ship itself is definitely something to see.  It is gorgeous.  We were amazed at everything that it had to offer.
On boarding day we ran into some issues.  I had purchased birthday decorations to be place into our stateroom prior to our arrival.  They were not there.  I had taken my mother on this cruise to celebrate her 82nd birthday so that celebration was ruined.  I had called a couple of times prior to our cruise date to confirm that these decorations would be there and was assured each time that they would be there.
Our stateroom number was changed upon check-in (no, this is not the reason that we did not receive the birthday decorations  our original stateroom did not have them either).  This resulted in a late delivery of our luggage.  They send us all over the ship looking for our luggage to no avail.  It finally showed up.
We did not feel the personal service that we had felt on our previous Royal Caribbean cruises.  Maybe the ship is just too big to give the personal attention.  Everyone was very friendly and would always offer to help  but then there would be no follow up.
We were a bit disappointed in the main dining room food choices  seemed to be a lot of the same things each day.  Of course, there are many dining options on the ship, but of course most of those come with an additional price.
Overall, we enjoyed the cruise.  We had placed high expectations on the quality and service and food that wed get on this particular ship.  Perhaps our expectations were set a bit too high."
5.0	Sail Date: Oct 13, 2012 /	First of all, this ship is HUGE! And boy-oh-boy did they make good use of all that space. The restaurants, the Boardwalk, central park, the solarium, the sports deck, the pools, the shops... the list goes on and on...
5.0	Sail Date: Oct 06, 2012 /	It was our 3rd cruise, 2nd for Royal Caribbean. You can't go wrong with RC. The service is always top notch. With all the specialty restaurants, its a foodie's dream vacation.
4.0	Sail Date: Oct 06, 2012 /	huge but not crowded
5.0	Sail Date: Sep 29, 2012 /	"This was our second trip on the Oasis and probably won't be our last.
The staff, the restaurant choices, the cleanliness were all \""A\"" rated."
5.0	Sail Date: Sep 29, 2012 /	The ship was incredible, great shows, excellent customer service and many things to do.
5.0	Sail Date: Sep 22, 2012 /	I have had 107 cruises on various cruise ships. Oasis and Allure of the Seas stand a lone. If you have never cruised before don't take them as you will be spoiled for life.
4.0	Sail Date: Sep 22, 2012 /	The boat size ws great and their were plenty of activities on the boat
2.0	Sail Date: Sep 22, 2012 /	Not the quality of the other royal ships, too much smoking, hard to book shows, food just okay, not on par, service as well. Guest services gave us the run around causing a delay, very hateful, turned his back on us. Everything too crowded.
3.0	Sail Date: Sep 22, 2012 /	i fell and they didnt care
3.0	Sail Date: Sep 22, 2012 /	Nice ship but I enjoy the Freedom ships better.... Maybe it is the size and layout of the ship.
5.0	Sail Date: Sep 22, 2012 /	My husband and I booked this cruise for our 10 year anniversary.  We were so excited and the ship/trip lived up to our expectations.  On day one there is a lot of confusion with the guests but everyone quickly feel into their own routines and for the rest of the cruise the congestion died down.  It did still get busy at the elevators at times, though.  The shows were fantastic, the food was good, the service was outstanding!!  There was so much to do onboard, we didn't get to experience it all...so, we are already planning our next cruise! St. Maarten is the absolute best port of call!  Airport Beach was a very surreal experience and the waters are gorgeous!
5.0	Sail Date: Sep 15, 2012 /	Great cruise ship, crew, entertainment, food - everything.  Highly recommend to everyone.  Next time we plan on booking the eastern Caribbean.
5.0	Sail Date: Sep 15, 2012 /	The ship has something for everyone.
5.0	Sail Date: Sep 15, 2012 /	This was our 2nd time on The Oasis in the past 6 months. It was just as great the second time as the first.  I highly recommend this ship.
5.0	Sail Date: Sep 08, 2012 /	Easy to get around, beautiful , even from the elavators, park and shopping mall, all the restraunts, shows, ice skating, clean, well organized from start to finish !!
5.0	Sail Date: Sep 08, 2012 /	This was my fourth time on the Oasis. We love it!
3.0	Sail Date: Sep 08, 2012 /	I personally prefer a higher level of personal service evident on smaller premium lines.
3.0	Sail Date: Sep 08, 2012 /	The ship itself was amazing and did not feel as big as I thought it would. You can find spots to get away from it all. They did a great job on the layout design. It took a few days to finally relax as the ship was full and you felt like cattle trying to get into the dining room and shows and waiting on elevators at certain times. On sea days we never had a problem finding deck chairs. The shows were amazing and much better than we thought they would be. Was going to skip on the ice show but were very happy we didn't as this was one of our favorites! The food was great in the dining room and 150 Central Park was amazing. We had reservations at the Solarium dining area one night but after we sat down we needed to leave because it was too hot. They had 2 large industrial fans going so I think they know this is a problem. They removed our dining charge without even having to ask. Service all over the ship was great and the excursions we booked were organized and awesome. All in all a great time but maybe just a little too large of a ship for our taste. Glad we did it though. One more thing, it took us about 20 min to board and our final day leaving was very well organized. It was like a well oiled machine, they have it down to a T!
4.0	Sail Date: Sep 01, 2012 /	"The ship's cleanliness was superb. The bathrooms are always clean.
The staff was very friendly and accommodating. The DJs were not  too accommodating
to request. They also should use updated music."
2.0	Sail Date: Sep 01, 2012 /	"-the cabin's air conditioning was lacking; there was NO filter; therefore, all the dust in the room was re-circulated night after night!  as a result, my allergies were horrible!  i woke up every night with unrested sleep AND darker under eye circles!  in addition, i didnt bring my antihistamines and all they had on the ship was benadryl! 
i'm tremendously disappointed in this ship since this is my 5th cruise - and i am now platinum status!  i had NONE of these issues on allure of the seas last yr!"
5.0	Sail Date: Sep 01, 2012 /	everyone should try this it was amazing the whole crew was very professional and extremely helpful . the ship was very big I never got tired of exploring and there was always something to eat . I will never cruise on a different ship because this is the best and you can't beat the best .
5.0	Sail Date: Aug 25, 2012 /	Shocked and amazed at the size of the ship as well as all the options that were available onboard.  This was our first cruise and we were so overwhelmed with everything to do and all the functions that were scheduled we really did not know where to start.  We smiled, non-stop for a week.
5.0	Sail Date: Aug 25, 2012 /	If we had never left the ship for island excursions I would've been just fine with that.    This was our first cruise but I have a feeling I won't be able to 'downgrade' to any other ship for another cruise. The staff really took this voyage from an A to an A+++.
5.0	Sail Date: Aug 25, 2012 /	It was the best vacation we have ever taken. I would srtrongly recommend Oasis Of The Sea's to anybody. We are already planning our next trip with the Family.
5.0	Sail Date: Aug 11, 2012 /	no additional comment too good to be true
3.0	Sail Date: Aug 11, 2012 /	It was full of kids, which we did not expect and were very disappointed that they were everywhere including bars and adult only pools.  The stateroom attendants and dining hall waitstaff was less impressive than other ships because we were required to prepay gratuity.  The ship was clean, bar drinks were great and there were a decent number of things to do.
5.0	Sail Date: Jul 28, 2012 /	We have been on the Liberty of the Seas and it is similar  but much larger.  The Oasis is a very comfortable and smooth cruise ship with many things to do.
5.0	Sail Date: Jul 28, 2012 /	I FOUND IT TO BE MOST IMPRESSIVE.  CENTRAL PARK IN THE MIDDLE OF THE OCEAN. WHO WOULD EVER THINK THIS COULD BE POSSIBLE.  UNFORTUNATELY,I FOUND THAT THE POOLS WERE A BIT TOO SMALL TO ACCOMADATE ALL THE PASSENGERS AND ALTHOUGH THERE WERE PLENTY OF LOUNGE CHAIRS THEY SEEMED TO BE ON TOP OF EACH OTHER ,MAKING IT DIFFICULT TO MANUVER IN AND OUT OF THE AREA
4.0	Sail Date: Jul 28, 2012 /	The ship and crew were awsome, our suite was roomy and the walk in closet was great to have.we found the food to be awesome as well. I mentioned shore excursions as cons, they were ok however. It seemed like the drivers had there own agenda they stopped at places to make us shop that seemed like they were helping there friends, we got to our final stop late because of weird shopping stops. Don't get me wrong we like shopping, but please.....
5.0	Sail Date: Jul 14, 2012 /	There is something for everyone on this ship. Even though thr ship was filled to capacity, it never felt that way. They were excellent at moving large groups of people. The shows were outstanding!!!
5.0	Sail Date: Jul 07, 2012 /	yes it was wonderfull
5.0	Sail Date: Jul 07, 2012 /	Great Cruise an ports of call.
3.0	Sail Date: Jun 30, 2012 /	The ship is amazing, and I would recommend it.
5.0	Sail Date: Jun 30, 2012 /	Better than I ever expected.
5.0	Sail Date: Jun 30, 2012 /	Everything was great. The service in the opus dinning room was 5 star.
5.0	Sail Date: Jun 30, 2012 /	This  ship is a floating city...the food and entertainment was outstanding.
5.0	Sail Date: Jun 23, 2012 /	The ship and the people were amazing.  My husband is disabled and we were a little disappointed with the port excursions (he is paralyzed and were told we couldn't jet ski or be guaranteed transportation etc, even though he only needed a taxi to travel).  Paying almost $120 to go sit and stare at Dunn's River Falls from an observation deck was their idea of an accessible excursion.
4.0	Sail Date: Jun 23, 2012 /	We booked a cruise on the Oasis to experience the largest passenger ship on the seas. We were a little worried about crowds with 5,000 passengers, but there was plenty of space and you rarely felt like there were that many people on board. Ship was fantastic, Central Park and the Boardwalk are innovative and a great experience. Highly recommend you give it a try.
5.0	Sail Date: Jun 23, 2012 /	beautiful excellent cruise, great activities
5.0	Sail Date: Jun 23, 2012 /	The vast size give you a chance to participate in alot and all shows, facilities, pubs, and bars.  More than you would, or could ever need.  More like a moving island.  The waiters and room attendants, un-beatable.
3.0	Sail Date: Jun 23, 2012 /	cruise was a very good experiance
5.0	Sail Date: Jun 16, 2012 /	This was our first cruise but won't be our last. The Oasis of the Seas is a beautiful, clean, spacious and very accomodating ship. We were in awe of its beauty and capable crew aboard. I would say this was probably one of the best vacations we have ever had because of Royal Caribbean.
5.0	Sail Date: Jun 16, 2012 /	HUGE ship, but onboarding was super easy and painless.  Staff was all very friendly despite personally witnessing them dealing with REALLY difficult people.  Drink prices aren't outrageous and overall, the complimentary food was good to great.  Ate at Chops Grille, 150 Central Park and the Italian restaurants with 100% satisfaction.  Yes, they cost more, but well worth it and cheaper than eating out at home.  Waitstaff in these places work really hard for you and are amazingly friendly.  You really can't go wrong on this ship.  One recommendation would be to try to book off season and get the cheaper price.  Also, the interior balconies face each other so we opted for an external facing.  I would imagine the noise in the center area gets somewhat loud so beware of that.
3.0	Sail Date: Jun 16, 2012 /	6000 guests makes for long lines
4.0	Sail Date: Jun 09, 2012 /	Everything about the cruise was great except two things. The web site and vacations outlet said you could not bring a bottle of wine on board the ship, and we found this to be untrue ;they simply do not advertise it. Secondly, it was a major turnoff to be required to pay a $100/week fee to use the sauna and steam room.
4.0	Sail Date: Jun 09, 2012 /	Very smooth sail - great entertainment and very good food.  Ship was huge and hardly knew you were sailing.  Some of the staff not very friendly and several staff members gave us incorrect information. Did not like having to schedule all the entertainment ahead of time , was very cumbersome upon the ship and did not like my time dining.  Book early and you can pick a preferred dining option ahead of time and also book your entertainment ahead of time also.
5.0	Sail Date: Jun 09, 2012 /	This ship had so much to do that you could not get it all done in one week so you can never get bored.  There are several shows to watch and many different activities to enjoy, for example rock climbing, zip line, trivia, art auctions (with awesome deals on art), wine tastings, cupcake making classes, tons of different pools and so much more.
5.0	Sail Date: Jun 09, 2012 /	It was an awesome experience.
5.0	Sail Date: Jun 02, 2012 /	This ship will ruin all other ships for you, except for it's sister ship, The Allure. You have to experience it to believe it.
5.0	Sail Date: May 26, 2012 /	Our experience aboard the Oasis of the Seas was magnificent. Boarding the ship and luggage handling was done in an efficient and timely manner. The staff welcomed us and made us feel special for the duration of the cruise. Everything from the clubs, entertainment, casino, food, dining options, pools, stateroom, excursions, parades, and the shops were beyond expectations. Central Park and the Boardwalk area added a nice touch to cruising. Ricky Matthews was the most amazing Cruise Director! I don't know where he got all that energy from. He kept us energized and entertained from the start. He is a definite asset to Royal Caribbean.
5.0	Sail Date: May 26, 2012 /	great ship
5.0	Sail Date: May 26, 2012 /	"This is one of the largest ships in the world, and it showed - everything was grand and beautiful. There are so many options on this ship in terms of food, activities, etc. You don't even need to go ashore on stops - it's even better then because there are significantly less people on the ship during stops since many do go ashore and there are no lines anywhere, no waits, etc. However, even when the ship is full on sea days, the lines move very quickly and waits are very short. 
We wanted to try one of the specialty restaurants but didn't even end up going to one because we enjoyed the Opus Dining Room food so much. Every night, the two of us got 3-4 appetizers, 3-4 entrees, and 1-2 desserts to share and tried a little bit of everything. 
The biggest factor, in my opinion, that separates this cruise from others that I have been on is the customer service. During every dinner, we were asked by the head dining room staff how we enjoyed our experience so far and if we have any comments to improve our experience. 
Overall, an amazing 7-day vacation that I would love to do again very soon!"
3.0	Sail Date: May 26, 2012 /	the service was great,the staff went through the trouble to remember everyone's name,we had 5 people in our party.the major short coming was the quality of the food and the cost for wine takes the glimmer of having champagneserved in your room each night.
5.0	Sail Date: May 26, 2012 /	Fantastic ship. Boarding and disembarking were a breeze. This was my husband and my first cruise, but I couldn't have been more pleased. My brother and his family have cruised before and they agreed this was by far the most organized and fastest they have ever boarded and disembarked. Maybe we got lucky, but we had the best service I have ever encountered.
4.0	Sail Date: May 19, 2012 /	There was a lot to do.  The food at all venues was excellent.  Most of all we liked the friendliness of the crew.
5.0	Sail Date: May 19, 2012 /	The ship is a marvel of architecture, joy, and ingenuity. I have a video clip of my boyfriend shaking his head in disbelief when we walked aboard for the first time. Priceless! Is's very hard to describe to someone not having cruised before. We are already scheming to do another cruise on the best ship ever in two years.
4.0	Sail Date: May 12, 2012 /	Food service, quality, temperature a perfect 10
4.0	Sail Date: May 12, 2012 /	"The ship is incredible.  Amazing number of options to fill your day.  

Also, upgrade to the Romance package - for $200 you get a bottle of champagne, muffins, 2 very nice robes, a bouquet of flowers, and canapes & dessert tray on the 2 gala nights."
5.0	Sail Date: May 12, 2012 /	The Oasis of the Seas is a beautiful and majestic ship.  We liked the neighborhoods, i.e. Central Park, Boardwalk, etc.  Loved, loved the Solarium Bistro for breakfast, lunch and dinner!  Great dining experience in the main Opus dining room - Milagros was our waitress.  Good pool deck layout and very friendly staff and stateroom attendant - Yuli is the best on Deck 9.  Captain Thor kept everyone informed and very hands on. Ricky Matthews, Cruise Activities Director was everywhere stirring up fun.  Loved Dazzles and the variety of music - we had some late night dancing there. Royal Caribbean should be very proud of this ship.
5.0	Sail Date: May 05, 2012 /	this was our first time on the Oasis of the Seas . it was the most interesting and beautiful ship we ever sailed . the food was excelent and the optional dining was far beyond our wildest imagination.
5.0	Sail Date: May 05, 2012 /	huge, clean beautiful, many restaurants and bars, fun, easy to get a round, plenty or elevators, comfortable room, excellent service
2.0	Sail Date: May 05, 2012 /	Way too big for any one with walking problems, smoking restrictions were awful, bars closed way too early, tv selection was horrible, the shows were way tooooo loud, a lot of the employees spoke very bad English, getting back on ship after visiting the islands was rediculous, showers very dangerous and no exhaust fan I bathroom was horrible
5.0	Sail Date: Apr 28, 2012 /	Enormous.  So many people but you would never know they were all there!
4.0	Sail Date: Apr 28, 2012 /	The ship is just beautiful, and there were never lines considering how many people were on board.  Crew was fabulous.
4.0	Sail Date: Apr 28, 2012 /	The ship was georgous and the biggest in the world and we didnt know that, this was our first cruise. It was very clean and all the workes that we met were very nice, helpful and friendly.
4.0	Sail Date: Apr 28, 2012 /	The boat made everything worth while.  That ship is truly amazing.  The ports (especially Jamaica) weren't well planned and the excursions weren't exciting.  Our excursion in Jamaica was canceled...
5.0	Sail Date: Apr 28, 2012 /	I will be going again soon.  I absolutely loved this ship!!!!
3.0	Sail Date: Apr 21, 2012 /	"I was not overly impressd with a ship this large. 
Cabins were smaller than on smaller ships,
Drawers were less than smaller ships.
no emmenities in Bathroom."
5.0	Sail Date: Apr 21, 2012 /	My children ages 10 and 11, had a wonderful time.  The ship's amenities are terrific and the destinations were beautiful...St. Thomas and St. Marteen.  We did not have enough time in the Bahamas and I think the tours are a waste of money, but we had fun, just not enough beach time.....and everyone expects a tip so bring lots of cash!!  But I am sure they are good for travelers who have never been to the islands before.  The food was great, service excellent and the ship was spotless.  We will definately return!
5.0	Sail Date: Apr 14, 2012 /	The ship is clean, staffs are polite, good variety and quality of food, sport facilities and activities.
5.0	Sail Date: Apr 14, 2012 /	Great time for the entire family.
5.0	Sail Date: Apr 14, 2012 /	Our family vacation was fun for the entire family ages 5 - 87.  The children begged to go to the children's camp.
3.0	Sail Date: Apr 14, 2012 /	The ship was awesome, very nice. around the ship. be prepared to spend lots of money. Announcements at 5:45 am was not very pleasant.
5.0	Sail Date: Apr 14, 2012 /	"Ship is exceptional! Staff for the most part, great.  Extertainment was the best, especially ""Hairspray"".  The private island Labedee was very beautiful with fun Zip line!"
5.0	Sail Date: Apr 14, 2012 /	From the moment we showed up at the pier to the moment we arrived in our room, it took only 8 minutes! They have the most advanced, easy departure process. You do everything on line so you don't have to stand in line for hours like you do on other cruise lines. Everything about the Oasis of the Seas is incredible. I've traveled on the Crown Princess, the Caribbean Princess and the Norwegian Spirit, and none of them came close to touching the experience of the Oasis of the Seas. This is hands-down the biggest ship with the most amenities of any other on water....and you never feel like you are on a boat with 6,000+ other people. Whoever is in charge of the logistics for the Oasis of the Seas should be winning all kinds of industry awards for how smoothly everything happens on the ship. I can't say enough good things about this ship, our excursions and the overall experience with staff. Top notch!
5.0	Sail Date: Apr 07, 2012 /	Oasis is the most impressive ship ever! It is huge - the largest in the world. The Central Park area is fabulous.
5.0	Sail Date: Apr 07, 2012 /	Excellent!
4.0	Sail Date: Apr 07, 2012 /	Gigantic. beautiful
5.0	Sail Date: Mar 24, 2012 /	Eventhough the ship was to capacity, it never seemed to be over crowded in any one area.  The staff was excellent.  The food was good, but could have been a little better with selections.
5.0	Sail Date: Mar 24, 2012 /	Oasis is a magnificent ship, well designed and well laid out.  Lots of elavators, and areas to go too.  The size seemd to make the cruise very smooth.
5.0	Sail Date: Mar 24, 2012 /	The Oasis is an amazing ship,  It has fantastic designs and attention to detail.  There were wave riders, zip lines, Pools galore and magnificant shows, if you could get into them.  The ship was amazingly clean and the crew amazingly friendly and knowledgeable.  Someone spent a lot of time cramming a lot into every corner of space.  If you have children, you will definitely enjoy this cruise.  Adults will love it also, but beware, I felt it was definitely designed for family vacations.  What a magnificant ship though
5.0	Sail Date: Mar 24, 2012 /	This ship was amazing! So many things to do and with 3 days at sea there was never a boring moment! Everyone should take a vacation on this ship!
5.0	Sail Date: Mar 17, 2012 /	Absolutely loved the Oasis of the Seas.  Would highly recommend to couples, singles, and families.
5.0	Sail Date: Mar 17, 2012 /	The most enjoyable ship - something for everyone.  Staff are very friendly and call you by name; remembered us from a previous cruise; go above and beyond to help and make every moment special.  We celebrated birthdays on board and they truly made it the best ever!
4.0	Sail Date: Mar 17, 2012 /	The ship is big and is impressive.  Even though the cruise was full, we never did really feel crowded in the dining halls or activities (we did have a wait some - approx 1-2 minutes - for an elevator after the large shows).
5.0	Sail Date: Mar 17, 2012 /	Amazing   Activities going on every minute everywhere!
4.0	Sail Date: Mar 17, 2012 /	The ship was huge, amazing and almost had too much to the point you really had to pick and choose what was important to do/see
3.0	Sail Date: Mar 10, 2012 /	Ship was gorgeous, staff was friendly, shows were great, cruise director was the BEST!
5.0	Sail Date: Feb 25, 2012 /	The ship is HUGE! It is almost overwhelming how much there is to actually do on board. The director did an amazing job making sure there was always something to do. The only down side to this was that there wasn't enough time to do everything.
4.0	Sail Date: Feb 18, 2012 /	"The ship is a ""Floating City"" and needs its own zip code.  It is beautifully decorated and the staff throughout the ship were always helpful.  The food was great and everyone indulged too much."
3.0	Sail Date: Feb 18, 2012 /	Pool in adult solarium is way too small for the size of the ship with its 6000 passengers. I realize you don't use pool on ship to swim laps but so cramped that all one can do is stand there to cool off.  I enjoyed pool in solarium much more on other RC ships. Not enough attention by pool staff to keep pesky kids out of adult only solarium. I had to go find staff on 3 occassions to report kids breaking this rule. This is irksome to do on my vacation and a total turn off to the this ship. Beds are arranged so awkwardly in cabin that there is barely room to walk to vanity or bathroom without bumping into furniture. On a positive note, the food was fabulous esp in specialty restaurants and shows very entertaining and unique. Very attentive service in dining room.
5.0	Sail Date: Feb 18, 2012 /	Big with lots of possibilities for food and showes
5.0	Sail Date: Feb 18, 2012 /	Overall, a very good experience, but you must know what you are getting into.  A big boat means a lot of people, so privacy will not abound, unless you lock yourself in the room.  Rooms were modern, nice and spacious for a boat.  Crew was generally excellent, very polite and friendly.  Activities on boat are plentiful, the shows are excellent.  The pools for babies are very small and if yours is not potty trained you will be constrained to a small area in the pool...
4.0	Sail Date: Feb 18, 2012 /	"This was our third cruise with Royal Caribbean and second on one of their ""big"" boats. I would recommend to anyone who likes cruising, try the Allure or Oasis .... they are spectacular!"
3.0	Sail Date: Feb 18, 2012 /	we had a great time
4.0	Sail Date: Feb 11, 2012 /	We enjoyed the ship, lots of activities and very clean.
5.0	Sail Date: Feb 11, 2012 /	Entertainment and the show were great. There were time that everybody flocked one area during parade and it made it hard to take a good look. I did zip line ride and they could not locate My picture when I approached the the guy who was in the picture area, he told me that the camera missed taking picture. That is the only complaint I had about the cruise.
5.0	Sail Date: Feb 11, 2012 /	After spending months in advance planning and researching for this cruise, our experience exceeded all expectations. The ship itself is amazing, and the service levels and food equal to the task.
4.0	Sail Date: Jan 28, 2012 /	The ship is spectacular--
3.0	Sail Date: Jan 28, 2012 /	"Rcommended, with qualifications.  Royal Caribbean continues to tout ""no smoking"" on it's flagship class, however the the smoking issue within the ship continues to be ignored. Every night when the majority of the people are inside of the ship the smoke seemed to be uncontained coming from the casino once again. One side of the casino is non-smoking but it doesn't matter.  Coming out of the dining room, one is instantly confronted with the smoke.  The same issue continues on the Promenade coming from the bars.  Recently, Royal Carribbean stated slightly over 50% of their revenue now comes from interational clients.  Because of this, don't look for RC to attempt to correct the smoking issue any time soon as the Oasis class of ships does draw a very large international client base and smoking is acceptable much more so outside of U.S. borders.  One woould think with state of the art technology available and a new ship, the smoking issue would not have to be talked about, but RC has chosen to ignore the issue. It simply goes back to alcohol, gambling and smoking will not be separated as this process is perceived as huring the revenue margin."
4.0	Sail Date: Jan 21, 2012 /	The cabin (for a balcony room) seemed smaller and more crowded than on other ships.  The shower was TINY (and we are average-size people).  Elevators were very slow and one in our group was handicapped, so had to move from floor to floor by elevator.  Food was average except a la carte breakfast in the dining room was excellent.  Buffet was always too crowded except on port days, and we prefer buffets where the staff handles the serving spoons as viruses are spread quickly by touch.  There were tons of things for children to do -- we wished our kids/grandkids were with us!  We love trivia, and this ship had more opportunities than most, which was great.  The Guest Relations staff was EXCELLENT.  Our room steward was EXCELLENT.  Our waiters in the dining room were EXCELLENT.  Our cabin was very warm -- we asked the room steward to try and get it cooled down, and it did cool a bit, but we still woke up in the middle of the night hot.  Uncomfortable and made for restless nights.  The shows were EXCELLENT, especially Hairspray and the Headliner show -- Mosaic.  The walking/jogging track on the Promenade Deck was EXCELLENT.
4.0	Sail Date: Jan 21, 2012 /	So many things to do.  Food was absolutely fabulous.  Ours servers Dadang & Kimon were the best!!!!
5.0	Sail Date: Jan 14, 2012 /	Great ship and staff
5.0	Sail Date: Jan 14, 2012 /	The Oasis is huge, but its easy to note where one is and where one wants to go, due to the visual aides throughout this ship.  The ship was very clean and there were always staff members near to provide assistance and answer questions.  We ate a variety of foods in a variety of onboard dining spots/restaurants.  The food was delicious and our dining experiences were enjoyable.  (We appreciated the Vitality recommendation insert in the Opus dining room menu when we dined there.)   Our stateroom was an interior room far fore-ward.  It was clean and well-maintained throughout our voyage.  It included a very comfortable bed, sofa, ample closet, desk/counter, drawer and cabinet space, TV with some international stations and onboard channels (including some interactive ones for making reservations, ordering room service, checking onboard expenditures, etc.), and a bathroom with a shower. The Oasis staff and crew were friendly, attentive, informative and pleasant.  Their professionalism and warm smiles made us happy to be onboard with them.  We saw wonderful shows:  Hairspray, Come Fly with Me, Oasis of Dreams (an aquatic show), Frozen in Time (an ice-skating show), Headliners (this week - the Texas Tenors), Comedy Live, Throw Me a Line (an improv show).  We participated in the Improv Workshop and rode the Zip Line.  Also, we took time to relax on deckchairs overlooking the sea.  We frequently strolled through the Oasis Central Park, and often we people-watched as we sipped coffee on the Royal Promenade.  We enjoyed our port opportunities and entire onboard experience!
5.0	Sail Date: Jan 14, 2012 /	This ship contained the most entertaining shows, excellent food selections and general overall excellent service.
4.0	Sail Date: Jan 14, 2012 /	This is a beautiful ship.   Taking a walk around central park is lovely. (though it's not that big) Every morning we would take our walk on the designated deck and then head to central park for coffee.  So nice!  Lots of activity around the ship.   The entertainment was spectacular - the best I've ever seen! (16 cruises)  Except on the pool decks, there were never lines or a crowded feeling.  Dining room food was good (as most ships)   Breakfast and Lunch buffet fine, but I've seen better.   Many pools and jacuzzis which helped to keep them less crowded.  Very easy to navigate around this huge ship - well marked and interactive maps available.
4.0	Sail Date: Jan 14, 2012 /	beautiful  cruise ship
3.0	Sail Date: Dec 17, 2011 /	"The ship was very beautiful, but very crowded. It was kept extremely clean and
nice. Not enough time in the ports of calls. We had a nice time because we had our family together for the cruise."
2.0	Sail Date: Dec 17, 2011 /	"This was a Eastern Caribbean 7 day with several days at sea. We had three families a total of 12 people. Crew outside of sate room attendant not very helpful and apathetic. One crew member in particular was rude to our group on at least two different occasions. This individual should never interact with the public and she was the handler of the ""Special Characters"".

Several Crew obviously not happy with what they are doing. Complaining in front of customers about other customers.
Food hours a little off considering when some of the docking and departing times were. Food selection not the best. 

This was the Flagship... The service and organization seemed off and not worthy of a Flagship. I can honestly say it seemed like all the bad crew was sent here right before being fired....

I am not a needy person asking for outlandish help. In one case we were trying to purchase an additional service but the person responsible to work it was not at the booth. We saw an employee with two gold bars and asked her. She told us to call some number on the phone next to the desk. It sent us to that Workstations Voice-mail. I almost set them up an interesting outgoing Message but I thought better of it.

Simply put, I will sail any other line before I go back to Royal Caribbean. Oasis and Royal Caribbean needs to refocus on why they are there...."
4.0	Sail Date: Dec 10, 2011 /	Outstanding entertainment.  Wonderful food.  Impeccable service.
5.0	Sail Date: Dec 10, 2011 /	This is a beautiful ship.  It always amazes me that there can be so many people on board, but it's never crowded.
5.0	Sail Date: Dec 10, 2011 /	This was our 30th cruise and one of our best. The ship is amazing.
4.0	Sail Date: Dec 10, 2011 /	Constantly cleaning all over the ship.  All personnel were very friendly and helpful.  Will travel again with Royal.
4.0	Sail Date: Dec 10, 2011 /	This is Oasis, supposedly to be one of the biggest ship in the country. High expectation and some what disappointed. Especially on the quality of the food. Some soups were tasty but some were overly salty. Some food tasted blend and not fresh. Ex. Windjammer's buffet (fruits, salads were almost spoiled). Same quality of food I would get from a 3 day cruise. Feel they spent way too much money on decorating rather than on the food. Come on, people go there for all you can eat high quality food. If I wanted Ryan's food quality, I would not have paid this much. Also, they charge high price on everything, drinks ($8.50ish for a cocktail), (over, close to $50 for drink packages), and most importantly to me is that they charge for steamed sauna. I've been to other cruise and they do not charge for steamed or dry sauna. Lastly, I received a coupon book for being a GOLD member. One of the coupon for internet usage for $5 off. I tried to redeem it but the customer service rep said it was a typo and they can not honor it. HELLO? it's not my fault that y'all made a mistake on the coupon! Bigger is not always better!
3.0	Sail Date: Dec 10, 2011 /	There is so much to do on this ship. However we never felt crowded, even though there are over 6000 passengers. Super friendly staff, and the accomodations are clean and new. The entertainment was great, though you need to make reservations to get in.The ports are too commercialized in my view. The Labadee haiti stop is a 3 star beach. The Cozumel and Jamaica stops are mostly for shopping. However, if you book other excursions, you can get away from the commercialization.
5.0	Sail Date: Nov 26, 2011 /	"There are so many words to describe this magnificent ship. The entertainemnt, the food, the friendliness of the cruise---all were exceptional. There wasn't a minute of the day that was boring. There was always something to do.
      The cruise director---AMY FICKET---was my first experience in my 84 cruises that there was a female in that top position---an she did a teriffic job.
       Our dining room staff: ""HAO"" our waiter gave us every bit of attention and was very professional in his duties, He was also very funny in his stories about the many cruisers he has met. His assistant ""cARLOS"" was a very friendly man too. RCCL will be losing a very good man while Hao goes on his two months vacation.
      Thanks, Eddie Malone, for steering me to the Oasis of the Seas."
5.0	Sail Date: Nov 26, 2011 /	Loved the Ship
5.0	Sail Date: Nov 19, 2011 /	The ship was more than I expected. There were many things to see on the ship itself. The shear size was impressive compared to other ships that were at port with us.
1.0	Sail Date: Nov 19, 2011 /	This is not our type of ship and we will not be back this ship.
5.0	Sail Date: Nov 12, 2011 /	"my overall impression was that it's a ""GREAT"" ship/  my husband and I were very impressed.  We hope to bring other couples with us on our next trip."
5.0	Sail Date: Nov 12, 2011 /	This ship and its crew were unbelieveably amazing, everything was so perfect,  This was our second time on the Oasis of the Seas and both times it was fantastic in every way--we hope to go again on the Oasis or the Allure.  Both these ships are fantastic!!!!

3.0	Sail Date: Nov 05, 2011 /	See above, not for older teens.
5.0	Sail Date: Nov 05, 2011 /	Great ship with georgios kitchen
5.0	Sail Date: Oct 29, 2011 /	There were so many things to do.  The shows were great
5.0	Sail Date: Oct 29, 2011 /	We were concerned about the size of the ship and being over crowded. From the minute we arrived at the port that changed. We were impressed at how easy getting on and even off the ship was with the amount of guest there were. The technology of the ship left no question unanswered from the computer boards located conveniently all around the ship to the TV in your stateroom. We learned our way around fairly quick and getting from one place to the other was not that great of a deal even going from end to end. The way they had things planned and timed always seemed to work. The food...SPECTACULAR. The shows... SPECTACULAR. We never had to wait for anything from a chair by the pool to a drink in our hands. You would never think there were 5,600 guests. We sailed at full capacity. The staff was so pleasant. They would bend over backwards for you. I took a great deal of pictures but they do the ship no justice. You have to see it for yourself to appreciate its beauty and magnitude. God willing we will go again. Many thumbs up to you Royal Caribbean. We would love to see you top this.
5.0	Sail Date: Oct 29, 2011 /	clean very professional
5.0	Sail Date: Oct 29, 2011 /	It is a wonderful ship.
5.0	Sail Date: Oct 22, 2011 /	Just got back from the RCCL's Oasis of the Seas 7-day Eastern Caribbean cruise.  I must say that it was a perfect vacation in almost every way.  Besides the sheer size of the ship (it's the largest cruise ship in the world), every facet of the vacation was perfection.  From the amazing food, the helpful and friendly staff, the wonderful activities, the amazing nightlife and activities and everything in between, I would highly recommend taking a cruise with Royal Caribbean anyday.
4.0	Sail Date: Oct 22, 2011 /	The ship was very impressive. Everything just seemed over the top. Although the pool areas were a little crowed, everything was awesome.
5.0	Sail Date: Oct 22, 2011 /	"ship was an architectural marvel.  the 'neighborhoods' were very impressive; the open air feeling even on the lower decks was great.
Getting on and off the ship in Florida was the easiest we've ever experienced, especially given the size of the ship and the amount of people -- 5500+ --"
5.0	Sail Date: Oct 22, 2011 /	Everything was well organized.  Well planned out
5.0	Sail Date: Oct 15, 2011 /	The ship was awesome!  Loved the boardwalk, central park, the shows Hairspray was awesome. We went to a comedy show one night and it was tons of laughs.  Also we made reservations and paid to eat at one of the Central Park restaurants. It was $30 each person (not included in the ship's price) and it was totally worth it. Yummy desert, great service, and wonderful steak.  If this meal was back home, I would compare it to a 5 star restaurant which would cost $150ish a person.
1.0	Sail Date: Oct 08, 2011 /	"The ship is very nice but too big the crew is overwhelmed they work long hours and have too many guests to attend especially in the dining room. 5000-6000 guest is just to many.  On sea days it is just too crowded in public areas.

For the money it was not worth it. This ship is all about how much more money can RCI get out of you. I would go back to sailing on the smaller ships. My family and I were not impressed at all with this ship. We prefer the Voyager class ships and will go back to those."
5.0	Sail Date: Oct 01, 2011 /	I just returned from my cruise on the Oasis of the Seas. Traveled from NY to Ft Lauderdale. Arranged with Royal Caribbean for transfers to the port. Pleasantly surprised port was approximately 5-10 min away.Security and Check in process was another approx 10-15 min and we took our embarkation picture and boarded. Once entering the ship you will be amazed at its beauty! If you have traveled on other ships you can then begin to explore . Plenty of guides and information to find your way around. My boardwalk balcony room was Beauiful!! We had perfect view to the Aqua theatre.The staff and crew were very friendly. I ave traveled before and enjoy taking photos . I was happy to see we now have an  option of having all our photos in an album. So now i can always treasure my vacation. I can definetely say I have experienced the best ship of th Royal Caribbean Fleet. Highly recommend the OASIS of The Seas!
4.0	Sail Date: Oct 01, 2011 /	This is one impressive ship!!  The fastest embark and debark ever!!  So many different areas to explore and different places to eat!!  Loved all the great shows.  The solarium was very nice to lounge in and the pool with the chairs in the water was awesome!!  We were located on deck 7 and that was perfect to most everything.  The service was top notch and the staff was super friendly.  If you love cruising, you gotta do this one!!
3.0	Sail Date: Oct 01, 2011 /	The ship was a fantastic vessel.  Many characteristics that we have never experienced while cruising.
5.0	Sail Date: Oct 01, 2011 /	we have done 10 cruises and on different ships but this one is by far the most fabulous!  the ship itself is a work of art;we can't think of anything that they haven't thought of.  The entertainment was 5 stars so was the restaurants and the friendliness of all the crew members also the activity director was the best!.we would highly recommend it!!!!
4.0	Sail Date: Oct 01, 2011 /	Great Ship -- Great Service -- No Problems
4.0	Sail Date: Sep 24, 2011 /	I found this ship to be huge and by far, fun with lots of things to do and see.
5.0	Sail Date: Sep 24, 2011 /	This is the most beautiful ship I have ever seen. There were so many activities that we were unable to do them all. But, that was fine, because we plan to book another cruise on the same ship. Royal Carribean did everything right with the Oasis. The specialty restuarants were will worth the money and the main dinning room was beautiful.
5.0	Sail Date: Sep 24, 2011 /	everything was good
5.0	Sail Date: Sep 24, 2011 /	The ship was fantastic, everyone should give it a try.  The stateroom was lacking in storage space, the food was just okay BUT the ship and the crew made this our second best out of 20 cruises.  I would recommend it for everyone, regardless of age.
5.0	Sail Date: Sep 17, 2011 /	Even though this was a mega ship,  it never seemed crowded. Boarding and debarking was streamlined. It took only 20 minutes to board and 25 minutes to debark! The food in the dining room was delicious. We saw all the shows  and they were spectacular. Be sure and make show reservation early. We never stood in line for a show b/c we had reservations. We loved this cruise!
4.0	Sail Date: Sep 17, 2011 /	This is an awesome ship with lots of diverse activities and really innovative public spaces. Plenty to do and great food options, while I never ventured into the Windjammer, all the other food venues are very, very good.
5.0	Sail Date: Sep 17, 2011 /	This ship has everything, for most cultures.  It is awesome.  There is something to do all day everyday on the ship and off when at the ports of call.  Simply amazing.  The food was awesome, the shows were better than most broadway shows and the service was unbelievable.
4.0	Sail Date: Sep 17, 2011 /	Bigger really is better! Loved Oasis of the Seas, sitting in Central Park in the afternoon, sipping a cool drink and looking up at the sky is breath taking. Had the most delicious dinner at Giovanni's. It's the best! Skip Chops and go there instead. We still talk about our dinner there it was that good! No problem getting a lounge chair by the pool. Getting on and off the ship was easy, not much of a wait. Royal Carribean knows how to treat you right. This is our 4th cruise and by far our best. Can't wait to go back again!
5.0	Sail Date: Sep 17, 2011 /	So far the nicest all around ship in the world
4.0	Sail Date: Sep 10, 2011 /	n amazing ship in that despite the size and the number of people it never felt crouded.
4.0	Sail Date: Sep 10, 2011 /	"Our first time on the OofS, past experience has been on the Freedom ships. Over all cruising experiences, I think I am favoring the Freedom ships, that is not to say the OoS was not a WOW!  We had no idea what to expect. New restaurants, a fantastic new pool areas and nightclubs were so RCCL. So we  enjoyed Royal Caribbean's style, service, and innovations, and the new OofS did not disappoint us.  The Windjammer buffet really isn't a ""buffet"" anymore,  it's like a cool marketplace/food court with many more choices, stations you can approach from all sides (so no endless line!). Very wide-open and airy feeling, a huge step up from the typical ship buffet. The  Seattle's Best coffee is top of the line.  Our stateroom was a little cozy for the price. Overall we have to say the ship was really impressive, the staff was wonderful as always. The biggest disappoitment was the closed in feeling while working out in the gym/fitness area. The open front view is more rewarding for me as is a close by changing area with wet sauna.  Fitness area has great equipment, but was not a pleasant experience for me."
5.0	Sail Date: Sep 10, 2011 /	"The ship is ""done right"".  Seems like RCL took info and feedback and put all the best features and them some on this ship."
5.0	Sail Date: Sep 10, 2011 /	This ship is crazy.  There was always something to do, the food was great, and the employees were very friendly and helpful.
5.0	Sail Date: Sep 10, 2011 /	"Is an amazing ship,breathtaken shows,quality taste and variety of food is excellent, very profecional staff srvice.
I hightly recommend it and plan to come back again very soon
It was the best wedding anniversary celebration i ever had.
Thanks

5.0	Sail Date: Sep 03, 2011 /	This is a wonderful ship. very high tech and very beautiful. if someone were to take just one cruise it should be on the Oasis of the Sea.
5.0	Sail Date: Sep 03, 2011 /	What a ship! When they say that the ship itself is the destination, they are not kidding! Activities galore! Tons of eating options! A really nice runinning/walking track. A built-in scavenger hunt. Top it all off with a feeling of spaciousness and the smoothest sailing we have ever experienced, and it was a heck of a cruise.
3.0	Sail Date: Sep 03, 2011 /	The ship was huge and beautiful.  Many things to do.  They just didn't have enough help.  A few were very rude, like the man in the gift shop.
4.0	Sail Date: Sep 03, 2011 /	The ship was AWESOME!!!  5 star all the way, very beautiful!  Staff & Crew were very friendly & helpful.  Everything you can imagine ever being on a ship was on this ship. There was so much to do and something for every age from infant to 100 years old.  The shows were fantastic, the best I've seen on a ship.
5.0	Sail Date: Sep 03, 2011 /	Best bar tenders on any ship I have been on. Ask for Cliff Gordon from Jamaica and tell him Don sent you.
5.0	Sail Date: Sep 03, 2011 /	This was certainly the best cruise we have ever been on. The ship and its crew are twin treasures
5.0	Sail Date: Sep 03, 2011 /	Overall it was great !! Needed more time to enjoy eveything service was great shows/entertainment was great  ship is beatiful !! Already planning for the next one !!
5.0	Sail Date: Sep 03, 2011 /	The ship is beautiful! I liked Boardwalk and Central Park..  I like the fact that there are so many places to eat that none of them are too crowded.  The only thing I did not like was that the elevators were all so busy and had to wait at dinner times. There was so much to do on board that there is something for everyone no matter what the age.
5.0	Sail Date: Sep 03, 2011 /	Ship is great.  So many things to do and it did not feel crowded.
5.0	Sail Date: Sep 03, 2011 /	"Our son has cancer and had never been on a cruise.  We took him on ""Oasis of the Seas"".  He had the best time of his life on it.  He got to do things on this ship that he probably would never been able to do otherwise.  He enjoyed the flowrider immensely and we enjoyed watching him.  The food was fantastic.  I've never seen him eat so much.  Overall it was a very enjoyable trip and a lot of good memories.  We plan to return and make it a whole family affair."
4.0	Sail Date: Aug 27, 2011 /	The oasis was so clean and inviting. My husband has special dietary needs and they were so accomodating. Hairspray was amazing and the crusie director made the entire trip. He was hilarious. At times I was crying from laughing so hard. I would do this ship again. It was great.
4.0	Sail Date: Aug 27, 2011 /	It is the destination
4.0	Sail Date: Aug 27, 2011 /	Everyone who has ever taken an occasional cruise should schedule one on this great ship.   It doesn't feel like you are moving when it is going at 20 knots.  The Central Park venue , the Broadwalk experience, and the aqua theatre are fantastic to walk through and enjoy.   The shows are the best professional quality I have ever seen on a cruise ship---all young and talented performers who make the shows most enjoyable.
5.0	Sail Date: Aug 20, 2011 /	"My overall impression of the ship,first was well organize,staff was very helfull,friendly
and willing able to serve when needed"
4.0	Sail Date: Aug 20, 2011 /	Very clean ship. Good Crew.Good food.
5.0	Sail Date: Aug 20, 2011 /	Spotless, great food, wonderful staff.
3.0	Sail Date: Aug 13, 2011 /	Customers should be informed that if they do not make reservations for shows they will have to wait on another line until all reserved seats are filled (10 minutes before the show) to see if they can be allowed in.  Hairspray show did not complete for the first 3 shows due to technological difficulties.
5.0	Sail Date: Aug 13, 2011 /	Very large & intimidating at first but within 2 days you can easily find your way around even with out the help of the touch screen displays or crew.
3.0	Sail Date: Aug 13, 2011 /	The ship was spectacular.  Never imagined something this magnificant.
2.0	Sail Date: Aug 13, 2011 /	"Very nice ship with lots of activities but noisy staterooms and shows with the music so intense it hurt and caused ringing in the ears were major disapointments.  RC has improved their shows but the food quality has continued to drop as they emphasize their ""for pay"" food choices."
5.0	Sail Date: Aug 06, 2011 /	The ship was just amazing, so much to do and see.  There were constant activities and some very unique experiences as compared to other ships we've been on.
4.0	Sail Date: Aug 06, 2011 /	Can't really say much but WOW!  You will be blown away when u first walk on
5.0	Sail Date: Aug 06, 2011 /	The ship was gorgeous. The experience was amazing. It offered anything you could possibly think you'd want to do for recreation.  It was clean, well kept and beautiful.  You never realized there were 5,000 other people on board because they were so spread out doing everything there was to do.
4.0	Sail Date: Jul 30, 2011 /	The ship was very clean and the staff members were very helpful. The ship was very nicely decorated!  The entertainment was excellent. The ship had a great deal of activities, clubs, music and game shows for all ages. There were so many things to do, it was hard to choose! The food was disappointing!  I did not like the taste or quality of the food. Would have liked to see more fresh seafood and more of a variety.
5.0	Sail Date: Jul 23, 2011 /	"This was my 5th cruise and so far the best one.  The experience was
awsome. The layout of the ship was great, considering the size of
the ship one would think that it will be difficult to get around.
The ports were great.  It would be a good idea if passengers be allowed easy access to the mainland in Labadee.  To all cruisers
you must try the Oasis of the Seas."
2.0	Sail Date: Jul 23, 2011 /	"1. The ship is marvelous, the entertainment is excellent. the waiters are 
working hard to please the customers; but not all of them are well qualified. 
Probably because it is a new ship and it is hard for the company to find that 
many qualified stuff members.   

2. some of the food is not that fresh, such as scollop; most of the soups are so 
salty to swallow; the chef apparently do not know how to cook the Pork medallion and beef dishes, the lamb screw looks so ugly and taste horrible; the lobster is over cooked; The stroganoff is even much worse than the one the school cafeteria does, the beef inside is hard to chew.
3. the customer service is a nightmare, you have to wait longtime in a line. I 
was trying to pay off my account using my credit card at 1:30am at the departure date, they asked me to sign a paper that authorized the Company to charge my credit card without the amount. i.e. I need to authorize them to charge any amount. I simply want to sign a receipt with an exact pay off amount. A Haitian customer service person first indicated that every customer needs to sign it since it is company's policy, and then a huge indian guy, (he said he is a vice supervisor), told me that if I want to pay off the account, I have to come back in the morning. I asked when exactly I should come since it is already in the morning, (1:30am) and why later time is different than now, he could not give me an exact time nor a reason I need to came back to pay it off. when I checked whether I could talk to his supervisor, he said first that he does not have a supervisor, I was speechless. He later changed the tone that he has a supervisor but s/he is not available......; and he also told me that if I came 
back in later time, I had to sign the same paper. what a nightmare! 
4. the ports of call are not that good; first port is a Royal Caribbean owned 
Haiti park. you would not want to go to a place which is no difference as on the 
ship.It is like a set up that you need to continue to spend your money on the 
same company. 
5. everyone would have known that all foods on board would be inclusive 
for a cruise; well not at this one! there are quite a few, more than 5, specialty restaurants require you to pay to dine. 
6. the entertainment is excellent, no doubt about it.
7. the sports service stuff are very nice, they know what they do and very 
professional. 
8. the room attendants are good, they did a diligent job to keep everything 
clean."
4.0	Sail Date: Jul 16, 2011 /	the ship was great but the cabin was very small
4.0	Sail Date: Jul 09, 2011 /	"Had a few negative expieriences. Actual saw two member in a fight and blood was actually shed. 
Dining room service was not good i can only attribute that to my time dining. 
Had a few issues with the excursions."
4.0	Sail Date: Jul 09, 2011 /	The ship was grandious. The areas like Central Park, Boardwalk and Sports Areas were great.  The shows were all spectacular, especially the Diving Show in the Aqua Theater and Come FLy With Me.  The service overall was very good by everyone.  Only issue was not enough louge chairs with umbrellas .. they shoul dhave umbrellas to put for guests wherever the guest wants an umbrella, not fixed and so little of them.  The tour in Cozumel to San Gervasio was a big disappointment. It was infested with Mosquitos.. THey should state that it is infested with a great deal of mosquitos, to the point where people where walking back to the bus and not taking the tour b/c it was unbearable. It should be stated in the tour excursion details more clearly.
3.0	Sail Date: Jul 09, 2011 /	The ship was huge it was very confortable, well kept, and clean. Crew members do an extraordinary job moving all the passangers when going on port. But at times it get too crowded and I just didn't like the fact that a lot of stuff was not included in the price, even some areas were restricted, in that sense I prefer a smaller ship.......
4.0	Sail Date: Jul 09, 2011 /	The ship was beautiful, to say the least.  The stateroom was large and had lots of places to store our belongings.  I was impressed with the organization of the bathroom.  Although it looked small, it had everything and was quite comfortable.  I was particularly impressed by the size of this ship, The Oasis of the Seas.  We sailed at full capacity, so it had about six thousand guests and over two thousand employees on board--that's a city on the high seas.  In spite of the number of people on board, you could always find a quiet spot for relaxation.  The ship was divided into neighborhoods, a novel idea.  If you wanted to shop, there were lots of shops along the promenade deck where you could browse or stop at one of the many bars for a drink.  It felt very much like being on a city street.  Central park was  true to its name--lots of greenery and restaurants.  We spent many hours there enjoying the atmosphere.  The boardwalk was also fun, with lots of activities for children as well as adults.  The carousel was a surprise.  The many specialty restaurants included, Chops Grille for great steaks, Giovannis for Italian food, and a seafood restaurant.  Unfortunately, we only tried Chops Grille, and the steak was as good as we had heard.  The wines are a little too expensive, so next time, we plan to pre purchase a wine package for our dining pleasure.  There were numerous activities from swimming to basketball.  We were amazed to dicover a full miniature golf course as well as over six ping-pong tables.  This ship has it all.  My husband and I are already planning to cruise on this ship again, but this time with our best friends.
5.0	Sail Date: Jul 09, 2011 /	It will be difficult to go to another cruise ship after the Oasis... It is worth the $.. I'm planning the next trip already for next year..
3.0	Sail Date: Jul 02, 2011 /	"I only gave the boat a good rating because I had a very bad experience on the last night of the cruise at the Windjammer buffet.  I took what was labeled simply as ""Chocolate Cake"" and had a severe allergic reaction.  I found out later that it had a hazelnut cream but there was no mention of any type of nut on the cake label or any mention of the possibility that it may have a nut ingredient.  For those with allergies just putting a sign that states ""may contain nuts"" would have been enough to keep me far away from it.  Even though we had an amazingly great time on the boat this experience did put a damper on our enthusiasm for Royal Caribbean and the Oasis of the Seas.  I'm surprised that Royal Caribbean does not take food allergies seriously enough to just put a simple allergen warning sign in front of certain foods at the buffet.  The buffet managers response was even more puzzling when my wife brought it to his attention.  He admitted that it did have a hazelnut cream and went on to send us a plate of chocolate covered strawberries to our stateroom to make things better (insulting at best).  To this day I'm not sure if the sign was mislabeled or if this is just standard labeling for buffet service.  Other than this problem the cruise was wonderful."
5.0	Sail Date: Jul 02, 2011 /	I recently took a trip on the Oasis of the Seas with my boyfriend.  I was very sad when it was time to come home.  Every person who worked on the ship that I came in contact with was extremely helpful and friendly.  One day we ordered room service and it came late, causing us to almost be late for our excursion.  The next time we ordered room service it came precisely on time and we also received complimentary champagne and chocolate covered strawberries.  There were so many activities to do and also a lot of space to just relax in.  Shows, restaurants, and excursions fill up quickly so it is best to reserve them before going on the cruise, or right in the beginning.  Boarding and departing from the ship was always done in an orderly and timely manner.
5.0	Sail Date: Jul 02, 2011 /	My whole family had a great time.  Friendly staff, beautiful ship.  We loved the variey of shows and activities onboard.
5.0	Sail Date: Jul 02, 2011 /	This cruise was a tremendous adventure.  I love the entire experience from top to bottom .  I would highly recommend this ship and this cruise to anyone.
4.0	Sail Date: Jul 02, 2011 /	Well done.  Suggestion:  Should offer ship tours to people willing to pay for it.
5.0	Sail Date: Jun 25, 2011 /	The entire experience was beautiful, the ship is kept spotless, the level of service was very impressive. The Royal Caribean Staff is friendly, warm and professional.
5.0	Sail Date: Jun 25, 2011 /	The ship was was very nice overall.
4.0	Sail Date: Jun 25, 2011 /	Fabulous!  Wonderful cruise
5.0	Sail Date: Jun 25, 2011 /	The ship was, as I said above the best.  My children and grandchildren didn't want to leave the ship.  Great selection of food, wonderful day camp, terrific service, wonderful shows and spotlessly clean.
4.0	Sail Date: Jun 25, 2011 /	We thought the ship was really beautiful and provided all the amenities anyone could want.
1.0	Sail Date: Jun 18, 2011 /	You could not eat and relax.  You was always interupted by staff and if you went to restroom your food was taken away.   People runnning through hallways. Housekeepers came in room while you were asleep.
4.0	Sail Date: Jun 11, 2011 /	The ship was awesome it is a great ship for the family. Not my choice for a getaway with just my husband. I would go on a smaller ship. It was very clean.
4.0	Sail Date: Jun 11, 2011 /	The ship is absolutely amazing! There is always something to do, whether its a show, shop, watch a movie on the huge screen, etc.  The food was not as good as it has been on other Royal Carribean cruises. However, they do have about 5 specialty restaurants that you can choose from. I didnt eat in any of them but the menu looked good. The service was great and everything was very clean. For lunch we opted for Park Central as opposed to the windjammer and it was a great choice. They have paninis, make your own salad, desserts, etc...this is also free.  I would def recommend
4.0	Sail Date: Jun 11, 2011 /	THe ship was Awesome. There were so many things to do you could not do them all in one week. The ship was very stable you could barely tell it was moving.
4.0	Sail Date: Jun 11, 2011 /	The ship was beautiful and for the most part the workers were helpful.
5.0	Sail Date: Jun 11, 2011 /	The ship is absolutely beautiful.  I didn't even realize I was on the ship when I first stepped on board.
5.0	Sail Date: Jun 04, 2011 /	The ship is amazing.  Just beautiful--the size is what you cannot believe!
5.0	Sail Date: Jun 04, 2011 /	"This cruise was a surprise reunion fror a very good friend of my wife's who booked internationally.  Hard to believe, but we could not arrange to sit with them at dinner through RCL- their computer systems cannot communicate, and no one can send an e-mail to that department to have it done manually.  Once on board, however, our problem was solved at the restaurant.

We purchased the ""suite upgrade"".and it was well worth it.  Had a great view of everything, and the staff in the loft suites are super - not overbearing, but ready to do whatever it takes on a moments notice."
5.0	Sail Date: Jun 04, 2011 /	"The Oasis of the Seas is an unbeliveable experience.  From Central Park to The Boardwalk this ship is worth the price of the cruise itself.  You have 2 Flow-riders, the Zip-Line, 2 rock climbing walls not to mention the constant entertainment.  The show Hairspray was Broadway quality being 1 1/2 hours long with a quality cast.  The food service was superior.  Housekeeping was excellent. The cleanliness of the ship was temendous.  

The captain and his entire crew should be commended for their attitude and service.  Our cruise director Richard Spacey  was a complete entertainer and extremely funny and active person.  

In 1 word to sum up our week,  WOW !!!!!

Great value for your money."
5.0	Sail Date: May 28, 2011 /	Great, loved central park.

5.0	Sail Date: May 21, 2011 /	The ship was amazing so many options. The room was a bit small but the bed was one of the most comfortable beds ever.

3.0	Sail Date: May 14, 2011 /	Clean; too large for our taste; staff not as friendly or courteous  as on other cruises.
5.0	Sail Date: May 14, 2011 /	Great times,  you will never go wrong with Royal Carribean.
5.0	Sail Date: May 14, 2011 /	It was a terrific experience and a repeat trip is in the future.
3.0	Sail Date: May 14, 2011 /	The ship itself was very good. We didn't get to spend the first 3 days of our vacation on the ship due to Airplane difficulties two times. This was the worst vacation ever. We was suppose to be celebrating out 25th anniversary plus healing time for me from breast cancer surgery done the Monday before. Instead it was a very stressful experience all the way around.
5.0	Sail Date: May 07, 2011 /	This ship is so beautiful no words could ever express. Anyone wanting to take a cruise this is the ship for you.  The service by everyone was the best. the food was oh so good and there was tons of it everywhere. The shows were top rate.There is so much to do you need more time to try and do all the fun things. we hope to take this cruise many more times.
5.0	Sail Date: May 07, 2011 /	This ship was absolutely amazing, in size and in service.  Even though it is a big ship with more passengers, the service and food is still outstanding.  One week is not long enough to see all the shows and participate in all the activities.
5.0	Sail Date: Apr 30, 2011 /	It was beautiful.
4.0	Sail Date: Apr 30, 2011 /	This is by far the best cruise ship ever.!
3.0	Sail Date: Apr 30, 2011 /	tired of cirque du soleil, get back to show music and dancing.  the hairspray and comedians were MUCH better then the other shows-ship is really special-some crowding in breakfast dining room and some hard to find tables in the buffet-should never have to wait up to 15 to find food! liked the ship but to me the rc voyager class is enough but i wanted to experience this ship at least once
5.0	Sail Date: Apr 30, 2011 /	I really enjoyed the cruise since all the crew members were always very friendly, and they will defend your cause to the fullest if they know you are being mistreated.
5.0	Sail Date: Apr 30, 2011 /	Great ship with so many options of things to do and places to eat. Loft suites are awesome.  Wonderful entertainment.
5.0	Sail Date: Apr 23, 2011 /	the ship was wonderful and so much to see and do for all ages
4.0	Sail Date: Apr 16, 2011 /	quick check in, ship beautiful, accomodations perfect.  Food a little dissapointing. Many many activities.
4.0	Sail Date: Apr 09, 2011 /	The Oasis of the Seas was like none other that I have cruised on. It is a floating five star resort. The attention to detail was amazing to say the least. The only negative that I have is that you have to make reservations for the shows, and if you pick my time dining beware as you will always have to wait in line.
5.0	Sail Date: Apr 09, 2011 /	Oasis is the most beautiful ship we've ever seen yet.  This is one vessel that would stay in our minds for a very long time.
4.0	Sail Date: Apr 09, 2011 /	It looked big.  There seemed thousands that entered.  The layout and design was awsome.  It never felt excesivly crowded.  I have been on other ships that were not layed out as well.  The only problem was that the specialty shops faced in towards the ship and not out to the ocean.  Got to see the splash zone!!
2.0	Sail Date: Apr 09, 2011 /	The food was a big disappointment.   Also, not up to par was the staff in several locations, ie. guest services, wait staff in Windjammer did not seem to support personal hygeine.
4.0	Sail Date: Apr 02, 2011 /	The ship was amazing and the color schemes were very eloquent.  The coffee was totally undrinkable, strong and tasted burnt.  Tried it several times but it never improved.  The excursion we experienced in Jamaica was terrible.  It was $49 per person and the woman who was narrating the excusion did not stop for photos, only at Pier 1.  She stopped at a small shopping area that was awful, apparently she was either related or knew the person who was running the shops.  She could have stopped at Margaritaville at the least.  The service was absolutely amazing.  Your arrival and departure was the smoothest we have ever experienced and this is probably our 7th cruise.  We were amazed that with over 6,000 people on board, we never once felt crowded.  The entertainment was wonderful and could not have been better.
5.0	Sail Date: Apr 02, 2011 /	My wife and I thoroughly enjoyed our 25th anniversary on this great ship.
3.0	Sail Date: Apr 02, 2011 /	The ship was exceptional.  Our stateroom was compact but well organized.  Our favorite deck was Central Park.  If you didn't look out of your window you would never know you were on a ship.  It was a wonderful environment.  The entertainment provided like Hair Spray, Come Fly With Me, etc., was Broadway quality.
5.0	Sail Date: Apr 02, 2011 /	CLEAN, FRIENDLY, HELPFUL, AND  YOU CAN HAVE A REALLY FUN TIME
4.0	Sail Date: Apr 02, 2011 /	A very impressive ship.  It's a huge one.  Only drawback is that for a ship of that size, there is not only one dance floor that could hold more than 4 or 6 pairs.  The nice music and good singers seem to be wasted...........The lounges should be big enough to allow a more reasonable dance floor.
4.0	Sail Date: Apr 02, 2011 /	The ship was clean, beautiful and customer service was excellent.
3.0	Sail Date: Mar 26, 2011 /	"The service is great.  The people are so friendly and the cruise line obviously does a lot of training.  Very, very impressive.

The ship itself is nice and easy to get around.  But, is too large (holds too many people) for eating, entertainment (shows), pool, and food quality is not as good as the smaller cruise ships."
4.0	Sail Date: Mar 26, 2011 /	The cruise ship was outstanding and even better was the Cruise Director.  He made the vacation and time on the ship most enjoyable.  We are already planning another vacation on the Oasis of the Sea.  If you are ever on this ship, you must also get a Tenxing Martini from Giovanni's Table!
4.0	Sail Date: Mar 26, 2011 /	Very much enjoyed shows, cruise director was great etc.   However, although nice, staff not as on the ball as Disney cruise line.  Also found food to be inconsistent.  One meal very good followed by one not so much.  Stay away from fish and you will be fine.  Japanese rest. very good
3.0	Sail Date: Mar 26, 2011 /	This is a beautiful ship.  Very new, great service, great rooms, lots of things to do and great teen programs.  I don't think I am really a cruise person so take this with a grain of salt - but wow, TONS of people packed on the pool decks and general restaurants.  Hard to even find chairs much less an actual space to get in the pools. The big fancy atrium is great but compared to other ships,  you can really  tell they lost pool space and options and privacy and space by doing the atrium idea.  We like to find hidden less used pools to use on ships and there were NONE to be found unless you were on a different suite patron level..
4.0	Sail Date: Mar 19, 2011 /	We recently sailed on the Oasis of the Sea, AMAZING!!! As a family with children of different ages there was always something for everyone.  We enjoyed everything from the spa to the shows.  However, we wish we would have discovered the Park Cafe a little sooner for lunch.  Another great place was Giovanni's restaurant, the food was amazing for such a small fee.  We left the ship relaxed and ready to go back to school and work.  We will definately sail on the Oasis again.
4.0	Sail Date: Mar 19, 2011 /	The ship was the most amazing we have ever been on. We have been on 9 curises with you and this ship was awesome. We had the best time of your lives with are children and will do it again. Thanks for a great vacation.
5.0	Sail Date: Mar 19, 2011 /	Just extraordinary!!!!!  With a balcony stateroom overlooking Central Park, we felt like we were in a hotel.
4.0	Sail Date: Mar 19, 2011 /	Very Spacious, clean, and roomy. You never do realize there are 6000 other guests on board with you.
4.0	Sail Date: Mar 19, 2011 /	I loved this ship!  There are several things to do throughout the day and evening.  Although this ship is very large, it still has an inviting atmosphere.  It was fun exploring and bumping into the same people, often (which amazed me considering there are over 5,000 guests).
5.0	Sail Date: Mar 19, 2011 /	Over all the cruise was fabulous. This was our first cruise. My time dining isn't what it's made out to be. Had to call every day to get a spot and it wasn't for the time we wanted. but the wait staff was just fabulous and had a great since of humor.
4.0	Sail Date: Mar 19, 2011 /	The ship was almost at full capacity and we rarely experience any time in line waiting.  Our favorite place to hang out for a quick bite was the Park Cafe in Central park.  We never had to look for deck chairs there were always several available.  The solarium was a tranquil, relaxing spot for adults only.
3.0	Sail Date: Mar 19, 2011 /	Ship was beautiful and innovative, but missing a lot of the finer aspects of traditional cruising. Not suitable more meeting new people.
3.0	Sail Date: Mar 12, 2011 /	The ship was magnificent. It was immaculate. My stateroom was larger than expected. The staff on board couldn't be more helpful.
3.0	Sail Date: Mar 12, 2011 /	"Because of the number of people the crew had to service, it lower the quality of the
service.  Dining experience was devalued because dress codes were not enforced.
Not enough staff for teens - particularly at beginning to facilitate introductions and participation.  Food was the same for breakfast and lunch every day - no variety.  Dinner was a disappointment."
3.0	Sail Date: Feb 26, 2011 /	52000 guests well distributed to avoid crowding, shows were professional & varied
4.0	Sail Date: Feb 19, 2011 /	We loved the design and layout  of the ship.  Very easy to find your way around for a large ship. The entertainment was great.  Do not miss the Aqua show.
5.0	Sail Date: Feb 19, 2011 /	ship is amazing. very clean very nice, loved it!! flow rider was great.
4.0	Sail Date: Feb 19, 2011 /	bottom line family ship with kids.....
5.0	Sail Date: Jan 29, 2011 /	This was our 27th cruise and it was the best.  It  was well worth the extra money.  The sign on entry said to be prepared to be wowed and we were certainly WOWED from the time we got on the shpi until we got off
5.0	Sail Date: Jan 22, 2011 /	This ship was amazing.  I was very nervous with the amount of passengers that were going to be on board.  I thought that every venue would be over crowded, however, because there were so many different things to do, it wasn't crowded at all.  The boardwalk was wonderful.  The shows were great.  The overall experience was #1.
5.0	Sail Date: Jan 15, 2011 /	"First it seemed there were too many people.
First lunch was bad as we got on board.
Then, real good.
Desserts not a good chef!
Enjoyed the ship, the shows.
Pool, one ici cold, while so many jacuzzi's too warm!"
5.0	Sail Date: Jan 08, 2011 /	Although the ship is huge, they make it very easy to find your way around.  There are touch screens located throughout the ship to give you point-to-point directions, as well as to provide a list of activities, etc.
4.0	Sail Date: Dec 23, 2010 /	"fantastic in almost all aspects.
exceptions: sun chairs raced for by some, reserved for hours, not accessible to those who are actually there and need a chair.
gym too small for 6000 people, and children under a certain age should not be allowed on the treadmills as a means of babysitting while their parents work out."
4.0	Sail Date: Dec 23, 2010 /	The ship is amazing the shows are incredible
5.0	Sail Date: Dec 11, 2010 /	"This ship is not only the biggest, but the best. Beautiful impressive design with many interesting and expensive details. Everything is very well organized. 
Great entertainment. I strongly suggest to see all shows. Book in advance, to avoid lines. Come 15-20 min. earlier, to take better seats. We enjoyed Solarium. Don't miss Parades, on the first, and I think on third or forth day (see Compass which you get every day in your room). We were not impressed by specialty 150 Central Park restaurant. Our original plan was to go there, because of award-winning chef Keriann Von Raesfeld. But appeared to be, she's no longer working there. We went anyway, but regretted later. 
 Making sure you're never lost, a giant I-phone like, touch-screen plasma directory on every floor.
It's great for people of any age. There is something to do and to see for everyone."
5.0	Sail Date: Nov 13, 2010 /	the was beautifull,clean,spacious and had a wonderful staff and an amazing show program i have ever seen before, The food was excellent  as well       THE BOTTOM LINE IS THAT I WOULD BOOK ANOTHER CRUISE ON THIS FABULOS SHIP     GREAT JOB!!!!!!!!!!!!
5.0	Sail Date: Nov 06, 2010 /	"The design of the ship was spectacular.What I loved was how impressive
each theme was. Such as the Boardwalk, central park, & the Promanade also the activities
such as the zip line, ice skating, basketball golf the surfing pool. The solarium was outstanding. The shows were like nothing I have ever seen. The food was the best I have ever had on a ship. I found the ship easy to get around. Never crowded, and
no long lines. A very organized ship."
5.0	Sail Date: Nov 06, 2010 /	Oasis of the Seas was our destination.  We were more than satisfied with this adventure.  The ship was our destination!
5.0	Sail Date: Oct 30, 2010 /	The ship was beautiful, the dining choices and quality were outstanding, the service was awesome and the entertainment was fabulous.  I would recommend this cruise to everyone!!!
5.0	Sail Date: Oct 16, 2010 /	we took this cruise. after waiting for it for it one year.it was a shock &awe moment for us.the ship is gorgeous&filled with many fun activities.food was delicious.the variety was amazing.shows were out of this world.this was our fifth cruise.we will come back with our grand kids.
5.0	Sail Date: Oct 09, 2010 /	We were totally amazed at the workmanship on the ship. Every detail was completed to perfection.
5.0	Sail Date: Oct 09, 2010 /	The ship was fantastic.  Lots to see and do.  Good variety of shows in the evening.  The shows booked up the first night, which was a downfall.  Recommend that you book them before you board online.  Food and service was impecible as usual.  We had a balcony statement overlooking Central Park.  Great view!  We have cruised 13 times with RCL and this ship was the best.  Already booked the Allure for 2011.  Can't wait.
5.0	Sail Date: Oct 02, 2010 /	WOW, that is what we kept saying over and over. I could have stayed for weeks on this ship. Vegas quality shows, so much to do, so many choices. If you ever got bored on this ship it would be your own fault
5.0	Sail Date: Sep 25, 2010 /	"Being on the Oasis was nothing short of a fantasy.  Imagine, you're strolling through a park, listening to birds chirping, sipping vintage wine and star-gazing.  Sounds like New York, right?  No, it's the middle of the ocean!  I've read other reviews where ships have been called floating resorts.  Nice, but the Oasis is more of a floating town.  There was something for everyone: from the boardwalk with its' carnival decor and atmosphere (including an  authentic carousel), to the uptown ""Park Avenue"" feel of Central Park with a sidewalk caf, pergola, chophouse and Coach store.  We were never at a loss for great food where again, there was something for everyone.  Being health conscious (though we didn't always make it!), we often opted for the Solarium Caf which served up a variety of tasty, healthy meals with an international flair.  There were so many dining options (including a sushi restaurant, seafood ""shack"" and steakhouse)--not to mention  the formal dining room and more casual Windjammer buffet --that seven days was not enough to get to them all!  IWe've cruise RCCL before and always pleased at the friendly efficiency of the staff.  they're ready when you need them and almost ""invisible"" when you don't.  The layout of the ship, as with may others in the fleet,  was easy to navigate.  And, despite the large number of passengers...you never felt crowded and could easily find a spot to be completely alone.  Despite travelling at one of the fastest speeds of any other jumbo liner, the Oasis remained stable, even during some rough seas.  You could barely feel the movement and the gentle rocking at night made falling asleep a dream.
The only complaint  would be that some of the venues allowed smoking in certain areas.  I realize that compromise is necessary but smoke travels and putting all smokers in a side room or on the second floor of a club did help, but smoke travels and you could still smell it at times.  To be fair it wasn't strong but still present."
4.0	Sail Date: Sep 25, 2010 /	We just got back from the Oasis of the Seas.  We had a balcony overlooking Central Park.  We really didn't spend much time in our room but I loved the view of the Park from our balcony.  And what a view it was!  We loved strolling througyh Central Park.  And the Park Cafe -- what can I say!  The roast beef sandwiches were absolutely the best.  You must have one or two or three!!!  As for the pool area, we chose the Solarium.  Just marvelous.  If you had too much sun there was always a place in the shade right outside the Solarium Bistro where you can sleep, read or just veg.  Never a problem getting a lounge chair and that with 6,000 passengers!  The entertainment was world class.  Not one show was disappointing or just ho-hum.  Kudos to the cruise director.  He was fantastic!  All the crew members were very pleasant and outgoing and made everyone feel at home.  We met the assistant hotel manager and I must say he was the nicest person we have ever met(and I don't just mean on a cruise ship).  The ship was spotless.  Embarking and disembarking were a breeze.  We was amazed that it was such a short process in either direction.  We were told that everyone would be off the ship by 9:10 am and they were right.  I have been on many cruises where it took much longer with less passengers.   I'm already longing to be back on that ship and we just got back yesterday!   Highly recommend the Oasis to all.  You will not forget the experience.
4.0	Sail Date: Sep 18, 2010 /	OASIS OF THE SEAS  WAS ONE OF THE BEST CRUISES WE HAVE TAKEN WITH ROYAL CARIBBEAN. VERY SMOOTH SAILING, CONSIDERING  THE STORMS THAT WERE IN THE ATLANTIC OCEAN. FOR THE SIZE OF THIS SHIP IT WAS AMAZINGLY SMOOTH SAILING. THERE WERE LOTS TO DO ON THE SHIP.  LOVED THE FLOW RIDER AND THE ZIP LINE.  THE SHOWS WERE OK, THERE IS ROOM FOR IMPROVEMENT.   THE FOOD AND SERVICE WERE TOP NOTCH.  OUR WAITER KNEW US BY NAME.. LOTS OF RESTAURANTS TO CHOOSE FROM. EXCELLENT COFFEE BAR AT THE CAFE PROMENADE TO GO WITH THE SCRUMPTIOUS DESSERTS, NOT TO MENTION OPUS DINNING, SORRENTO'S PIZZA, AND THE JOHNNY ROCKETS' HAMBURGERS.  NOT TOO MANY KIDS ON THIS CRUISE, WHICH MADE IT NICE  AND NOT AS CROWDED AROUND THE POOLS.  CAN'T WAIT TO TRY THE SISTER SHIP ALURE AS WELL. ROYAL CARIBBEAN IS THE BEST...
4.0	Sail Date: Sep 18, 2010 /	From the moment we stepped foot on the ship it was magical! They went out of their way when they built this ship. Anything you could possibly want was on there....putt putt course, basketball course, ping pong tables, jaccuzzis, lots of pools, and our stateroom attendant was perfect! The food was so abundant, if you wanted a piece of pizza or a sandwich in the middle of the night it was available. Our private balcony made the cruise even more special since we saw gorgous sunsets and ate breakfast watching the sunrise!
4.0	Sail Date: Sep 18, 2010 /	Absolutely amazing ship!
4.0	Sail Date: Sep 18, 2010 /	Our cruise on Oasis of the Seas was the best ever. The ship is impressive!
5.0	Sail Date: Sep 11, 2010 /	THIS IS THE BEST SHIP EVER AND I VE BEEN ON THEM ALL. FREE ZIP LINE, FOR ALL TO ENJOY. YOU NEVER HAD TO WAIT ON A LONG LINE FOR FOOD AS THERE ARE SO MANY CHOICES. DINNING ROOM WAS BEAUTIFUL ALONG WITH THE STATE ROOM 9305 . WE HAD A GREAT VIEW OF ALL THE H2O SHOWS RIGHT FROM OUR BALCONY. FOOD VERY GOOD , SERVICE EXCELLENT, EVEN OUR PHOTO
5.0	Sail Date: Aug 28, 2010 /	"VERY GOOD EXPERIENCE, I RECOMEND THIS SHIP.
THE CRUZE DIRECTOR WAS VERY FUNY, I LOVE YOU,
ALL THE ACTIVITIES WERE VERY WELL PLANNED
FOR THE FOOD YOU CAN NOT HAVE IT ANY BETTER,
THE SHOWS WERE OF GOOD QUALITY, 
SERVISE WAS EXCELENT.
TODO FUE MUY LINDO, EL CRUZE DIRECTOR FUE DIVERTIDO, TODAS LAS ACTIVIDADES MUY ORGANIZADAS, LOS SHOWS FUERON DE MUY BUENA CALIDAD, LA EXENOGRAFIA FUE MUY BUENA.

3.0	Sail Date: Aug 21, 2010 /	this is a great ship for families with children not adults or seniors.
3.0	Sail Date: Aug 14, 2010 /	Improve more on safety especially around Elevator Areas where the Pools are located. They are sometimes wet and slippery and can cause accidents as during our trip my Friend's daughter Slipped on the areas around the elevator on the Deck where the Pools are located. Also the rising tide bar have to strictly enforced curfew hours on minors fairly and evenly to all regardless of race or color as what has happenned to what I have witnessed when the daughter of my friend was told to leave only to allow other minors to ride it after we leave.
5.0	Sail Date: Aug 07, 2010 /	There is no way to explain this ship other than just to book it and see for yourself.  It is a city at sea with a crew as eager to please as the ship itself.  The rooms were very roomy and clean, the service was the best I have ever experience on ANY line, and the food was sooooo good, we canceled one of our specialty restaurants to eat in the Opus Dining Room.  There was live music everywhere and they didn't skimp on drinks, food, or smiles.  Remember, if you are good to the crew....they will be very good to you.
4.0	Sail Date: Aug 07, 2010 /	All the restaurants are excellent! Cruise members and attendants are so friendly and provides great service!
3.0	Sail Date: Jul 31, 2010 /	Large ship catering to large groups or families traveling together.  Prior cruises provided for more personal service delivered by staff.  Food and service in formal dining room fair, at best.  Continued lack of enforcement of dress code compromises experience.  On board entertainment ok, not great.  Rooms smaller than you woud expect.
4.0	Sail Date: Jul 31, 2010 /	I had a balcony and smoking IS allowed on balconies, AND on 1 side of the ship where the pools are, AND in 1/2 side of the casino. Of course I had 2 heavy smokers in the balcony in front of us and I got all their second hand smoke, being down wind. Food was only so-so better on other ships. getting around was easy, ship is super clean and always so much to do. Staff was great! You had to pay for cupcakes and ice cream at their speciality shops! Amazing. Bring a big credit card along.
5.0	Sail Date: Jul 24, 2010 /	we enjoyed the ship,service,shows,activities.thumbs up for great ship
3.0	Sail Date: Jul 24, 2010 /	This was our first time cruising. We liked that it was a new ship. Our expectations was high due to the high price tag but sorry to say was very disappointed. The ship was nice but not worth the price tag.  The ports and beaches was not that nice either.
5.0	Sail Date: Jul 10, 2010 /	"Fantatic Stateroom
Excellent Service
Wonderful Food"
3.0	Sail Date: Jul 10, 2010 /	"breakfast was impossible to do almost, no seats, they ran out of cups.. you had to walk with food and search for a place to sit outside. Just too many people on this boat. The port are just royal carribean created compounds. You have to have the courage to exit the compounds to see the ""real"" port, which maybe to intimidateing for most. Service and food were good. Beds were really comfortable, rooms were nice.. Just very crowded.. lots of lines. Like disney world on the water."
5.0	Sail Date: Jun 19, 2010 /	the ship was beautiful and big.
4.0	Sail Date: Jun 12, 2010 /	The ship was very clean and the staff was unbelievable.  Very kind and helpful
3.0	Sail Date: Jun 12, 2010 /	"Ship was beautiful, clean and was laid out nicely.  Food was delicious and you could have whatever you wanted and as much as you wanted.  The dining experience was not a ""FUN"" as the Carnival ship we were on, but the dining staff were exceptional.  The staff was nice and helpful except for the medical area which was lacking.  Make sure you bring your own medical supplies, cuz there is NO one around for assistance.  My son ripped off his toenail on the flowrider and they did not even provide bandaids or antibiodic cream for him even though they did an incident report."
5.0	Sail Date: Jun 12, 2010 /	Ship was amazing.  Best weve ever experienced.
5.0	Sail Date: Jun 12, 2010 /	"The cruise would have to be longer to see everything on this ship...we did the best we could but did not see or experience half of all the things to see and do on this beautiful ship...the staff were all so helpful and friendly..we didn't eat in any of the special restraunts as the food and service in the dining room was special..like lobster tail, rack of lamb, duck, etc..for those of us that get sea sick, no worry as you can not feel the ship hardly at all..once in while a little bump..the ports of call were typical and the walk from the ship to the area was too far really to walk in the hot sun..it would have been nice to get a ride to the destination..the venues and shows were outstanding..""Hairspray"" was a wonderful Broadway show with great talent..the comedians were very funny without using bad language..we saw a different show every night and thought they were all top notch.."
4.0	Sail Date: May 29, 2010 /	"Embarkation 
Was a breeze except for the woman in our line who forgot to bring her passport. Uhhhgg! 
Got there around noon.
Those travelling with kids (under 13?) have an extra station to go through prior to boarding.

First thing was to put our carry-ons in the room and go have a beef-on-weck.  Was very good but so are all beef-on-wecks.  Man. I miss food from Buffalo.
Ship is just amazing.  Beautiful, big, and new.
Some would consider it too big but not us.  If you dont like to do too much walking and or are more into the excursion than the boat experience, this boat may not be for you.  For those who like non-stop floating fun and entertainment, try the Oasis.  Im not much of a wordsmith but suffice it to say, this boat is incredible!

General Tips
Deck 14, all the way forward, port side.  Take a walk as far forward as you can get.  Fairly private too.
If you see the option to go star gazing with the astronomy group, do so.  Mitch from Earth will guide your group to a very dark location to watch stars.  The location?  The Helipad!  Its the only way to get out there and Mitch does a GREAT job.  He seems to really know his stuff.  When we told a couple bartenders (Alex and Rei) they just nodded like we were crazy and said the helipad is forbidden for guests.  I still dont think they believe us.  Apparently, Mitch has gotten special permission to do this activity.  He makes it very clear that if anyone gets hurt or strays from the group that they will revoke that permission.  He illuminates many of the tripping hazards like the helicopter tie-downs, etc. with electric candles but you still need to be very careful until you eyes adjust.  He uses a very power full laser to point out planets and constellations.  I highly recommend it.

Room
Our cabin, 11324 was the third form last balcony cabin from the aft.  For me this was a great location for several reasons
It was a good walk to the elevators and even more so to all of the forward entertainment.  For me this was a great way to keep exercise in my daily routine because Im certain you will walk at least 1 -2 miles a day. Keep in mind this ship is a  mile long.
Conversely, there is not much walking involved when going to dinner as it is also in the aft section of the ship.  Just and elevator ride down.  No sweaty arrivals to formal dinner.
Being located near the end of the hall, we were able to easily go check out the seldom used public space overlooking the aquatic area.  This was a great place to have a drink, watch some entertainment, play cards, etc.
We had our two kids in tow, 10 and 15.  The 10 year old is 5-0 and the 15 year old is 57.  One is a cat and one is a dog and they fight like such.  The pull out couch was absolutely a fine fit for them.
The main bed was wonderful!  Pillow top.  Did not want to get up in the morning.
Bathroom was roomy as was the shower.
Whoever recommended bring a multi extension cord was wise person.  Thank you.
There was a slight sewer odor in the hallway sometimes.  There was also a sewer odor coming from the vent in the bathroom sink.  It would only smell when you ran the water.  It was pretty gross but I dont spend my time sniffing gasses from the bathroom sink so not that big of a deal.  The room itself never smelled badly.

Food
We really enjoyed the food and all the selections.  I dine out a LOT and thought the main dining room (Opus) food was very good.  They had a nice selection most every night. Keeping in mind that theyre serving over a thousand of people a 3 course meal in a 2 hour span is nothing short of miraculous. (the shot of the night shot glasses make for an interesting collection after several nights)
Contrary to other posts, we enjoyed a dinner at the Windjammer.  It had some pretty good food considering its a buffet.
We went to Chops where I had the bone-in rib eye and my wife had the filet, both mid-rare.  Both were very good and definitely a notch above Opus."
3.0	Sail Date: May 29, 2010 /	Poor food, service, shows. Food was just average. Shows outdted except for ice scating.
5.0	Sail Date: May 22, 2010 /	This ship was everything we expected and more! This was our sixth cruise, but only the second with Royal Caribbean. The crew could not have been more friendly and accomodating to the guests.The specialty restaurants were an experience we would highly recommend.  The entertainment was the best we have ever seen on a cruise ship.  We would highly recommend this ship to anyone who enjoys cruising and would certainly consider taking this cruise again.

Cabin #11188

ATTN:  Customer Service

 My husband & I planned a cruise to meet other people our age since we just became empty nesters.   We booked the cruise for second seating sitting at a large table of 8 to 10 people.  The two reasons we booked your cruise was to go to St. Thomas and to meet other people.  Neither of these happened.

DAY ONE of the cruise we were seated at a table of four for just the two of us.  We went to the maitre Dee stand to change it and they said they would.  One hour later they took us to a table that was full. 
At that point dinner was almost over so we sat alone.  They said that they would fix the problem on DAY TWO and that they would call us with a new table number.  We went to guest services on day two to make sure everything was set.  The lady at the front desk e-mailed the maitre Dee and said that he would get back to us before dinner.   He didnt so we went to dinner at 8:30 and waited at the desk for another hour to get help and they had no record of any changes.  These were the same assistant maitre Dees we spoke with the night before and they couldnt remember us and didnt have any record of it. We sat at another table alone because dinner was almost over.  

DAY THREE the maitre Dee called our cabin early in the morning.  He said what is it you want and I will take care of it?  I told him that we wanted to be at a large table and that was what was booked.  He said I will take care of it and call you back today.  I told him that I had been told that before and havent received any calls.  I told him that I didnt want to wait another hour at the maitre Dee stand.
He said I will call you back today.  I am the maitre Dee.  He never called me back. We went to dinner and they still had no record of it and didnt have any record of a table for us.  After three nights with no communication just threw up our hands and sat alone.  Again the same assistants said What is it that you wanted?  We just said never mind.  If they couldnt honor our reservations we should have been told ahead of time.  It is unbelievable that the maitre Dee never called us back.

When we booked the cruise we were going to Nassau the last day so we could have the first two days to enjoy the ship.  This was also changed.   As you know we didnt get to stop in St. Thomas so we really wanted to be off the ship by then.  We had a horrible trip

We have been on seven Carnival Cruises.  We had always heard that Royal Caribbean was better.  We had problem after problem with Royal Caribbean.  We never had any problems with Carnival.  If we did they would always make it right.

I am a retired travel agent and know several people in the industry.  I will not recommend this ship.

5.0	Sail Date: May 22, 2010 /	"The Oasis of the Seas is an incredible ship.  Obviously the size is beyond anything on the seas today!  The multiple pools were great as there never was a problem getting a pool chair as on previous cruises.  They really upgraded the bedding on this one too - very comfy!.  The ability to sign up for most everything online prior to going on the cruise is great too as we did not have to run around when we got on board to do all that - unpack and enjoy!  As always there was food everywhere and at all times.  The jogging track on the 5th deck was ""interesting"" - it was great to keep the hot sun off you when it was on the top deck but was like a sauna when the weather  was rainy and humidity was  high.  We are already booked on the Allure (sister ship to the Oasis) for May 2011.  We love the quality and personnel on the Royal Carribean Cruise Line!"
2.0	Sail Date: May 22, 2010 /	"too big.  not enough seating room in the buffet.  missed a port of call due to unforseen circumstances.  too many ""pay for"" restaurants."
3.0	Sail Date: May 22, 2010 /	This was our 5th cruise with Royal Caribbean and feel they are the best cruise line in comparison to others.  However, nothing really special about the Oasis of the Seas, just its size.  ALSO, on Day 2 (after leaving Bahamas) of our cruise, a crew member JUMPED OVERBOARD taking his life making our ship having to turn around to SEARCH FOR THE BODY according to US Coast Guard regulations.  They captured the event on one of the cruise ship cameras so as to locate the area it happened.  We could not make our St. Thomas stop because it cost us a day at sea, however, Royal Caribbean did give us a NICE credit towards a future cruise which we will use on the Allure of the Seas when it is completed.  Our daughter loved Adventure Ocean camp.  They kept her so busy and she didn't want to leave.  Also, it would have been nice to know that we should have booked our shows before leaving for the cruise because they were all booked for the week upon boarding.  If this ship can hold 6,000 people, they need to accommodate their entertainment for this reason.
4.0	Sail Date: May 15, 2010 /	overall the ship was the best we have been on before. huge ship with enough activities to keep every one busy when on board
4.0	Sail Date: May 15, 2010 /	There is so much to do on this ship and for the most part the crowd is not overwhelming.  Even though there are about 6000 people on the boat, it doesn't seem to get any more crowded than a normal cruise ship.  The choices for everything are great.  The specialty restaurants, especially Giovanni's Table are very good and you really feel like you are in a little city, not on a cruise ship.  Shows are mostly less campy than regular cruise ship shows and reservation system helps to plan your time.
5.0	Sail Date: May 15, 2010 /	like being in a city on the sea. royal caribbean out did them selfs this time. The shows were all broadway quality. food was good. For being on a ship with so many people it was very organized. I did not like the art auction something I always look forward to on a ship. They are not longer using Park West Gallerys I was very disappointed. Other than that it was a fantastic cruise.
5.0	Sail Date: May 15, 2010 /	"As expressed in the title of this review, this ship is nothing less than AWESOME!!  It is so beautifully decorated, so spacious, and Central Park with all the flowers and trees just made us feel so comfortable and made it difficult to believe that we were really  floating at sea.  I can't say enough for the great service that we received from each and every attendant on board....our stateroom attendant (Lincoln) was the greatest!!!  Such a sweet, caring and concerned person.  The shows, especially ""Hairspray"" and ""Come Fly with Me"" were fabulous....professional from the word go!!!!   It was so sad to hear that it was their last performance as a group though.  However, I'm sure their replacements will be equally as good.   Now that I've cruised on the world's two largest ships, Freedom of the Seas in 2007 and now Oasis of the Seas, I wouldn't even consider a smaller ship.   I would definitely cruise on both of them again and would highly recommend both ships!!!"
4.0	Sail Date: May 08, 2010 /	Beautiful ship.  Particularly liked Park Cafe for lunch.
4.0	Sail Date: May 08, 2010 /	tofo many people for the staff to handle but a beautiful ship to sail
5.0	Sail Date: May 01, 2010 /	It was far greater than our expetations.  We loved everything on board.  It was a dream come true.
4.0	Sail Date: May 01, 2010 /	This is the most amazing ship.  The shows are fabulous and the food incredibily delicious.  So much to do on board there is no need to even get off at ports.
4.0	Sail Date: May 01, 2010 /	big and nice. don't enen feel that I'm sailing
5.0	Sail Date: Apr 24, 2010 /	"I made my reservations in advance of the cruise 6 months prior to crusing. During that time, I continued to see more and more pictures of the ship and was amased of what I was about to experience. Well, the cruise day finally came and could not wait to get on board. Long flight from san francisco, but the wait was well worth it. I was very impressed on how organised they were on getting me on the ship. Being on previous ships with many people to get on board, i expected this to be difficult with so many people to get on the ship.NOT the case. I was GREATLY suprised on how I got on the ship so fast. NO long lines. and best of all, when I got on the ship by noon time, I did not have to wait 2-3 hours to get to my cabin and then was totally suprised how fast my luggage there too. By 1:00 pm I had my luggage and my stuff was put away in minutes. I then ventured out to see this fabulous ship. To my amesement, it was not only BIGG, but it was beautiful and impressive. More incredible than all the pic's i saw before getting on board and how unusual things were on board also. All the cruise support people were great, the cruise ship staff and all that greated me were wonderful.. I felt I was home and ready to start my fab, vacation. 

When I started to venture out on board, I found one of those electric boards that told me wher i was on the ship and how to get to any place on board. That was great. Other ships I was on was difficult to learn where everything was and how to get there. State of the art information board was terrific. 

So many things to see and do on this new ship had my head spinning. Not the ocean movement but how many different places to see and things to do.All the different sections on the ship were unbelieveable. The central park area was great. The prominade area was very impressive. The speclality restaurants were as advertised and the windjammer cafe was impressive. I really like the ""kiosk"" area where all the food was displayed rather than the usual buffet lines on other ships. The seating areas around that section of the ship was also very confortable and really never too crowded.. The ""MY TIME"" dining was just perfect. I came to dinner at any time I wanted and the service was perfect as I expected. The back of the ship with the pools, the shows and the two restaurants were great too. Loved the donut shop. What a great idea. ! ! Johnney Rockets was as expected and their service people were wonderful I loved their dancing to some of the old songs playing on the jukebox was a nice tuch.

Another great thing was getting on and off the ship at ports was also impressive. With 6 thousand people aboard, it was a breeze to get off and on. 

Two bigg nights I need to comment on. Saturday night was the martigraw presentation on the proninade and the fiftys night presentation later in the week was outstanding ! ! ! The cruise director hosting these presentations was great along with his staff. What GREAT FUN ! ! !

Last but not least, All the peole I went on the cruide with were so impressed that we are already discussing plans when we will take another cruise on the IMPRESSIVE  OASIS OF THE SEAS. My travel agent was wonderful and will be hearing from all of us soon to rebook another cruise on this FAB. Cruise ship."
5.0	Sail Date: Mar 24, 2019 /	Loved the size of the Oasis! Best ship I have ever been on. Promanone deck 5 was like a shopping mall. Stores on the sides and some kiosk's in the middle with plenty of room to walk around. Couldn't complain about much. Yes u do need to realize that there will be 6 thousand people looking for breakfast in the morning and sleeping in may put u in a waiting line for a while. All in all it was a great time.
4.0	Sail Date: Mar 24, 2019 /	Excellent cruise. Totally enjoyed it. A bit crowded for me. However, I loved the quality of service. Food was good. I liked windjammer better than my dining room experience. We were a group of 20 indians so they went a step further to make us enjoy the food. All the staff that I interacted with were genuine in treating me nice and offered good service.  Windjammer food was fresh and lot of choice. If it’s not so expensive I would do it again. 😀
4.9	Sail Date: Mar 24, 2019 /	Our cruise was a great exsperience. We enjoyed everything about it from dining to entertainment.
4.8	Sail Date: Mar 24, 2019 /	First time on the Oasis. Will definitely go again.  There was always something to do on the ship
4.6	Sail Date: Mar 24, 2019 /	Really enjoyed this cruise. The destinations were fine. We did island tours at each one. But the highlight of the day was ship and everything to do onboard. Great vacation!
5.0	Sail Date: Mar 24, 2019 /	I advise everyone must cruise at least once on Oasis of the Seas in their life time. You never get bored. Seven days passes by just like that. Good food and entertainment, ambience, activities. Worth the money. Ports are worth visiting.
5.0	Sail Date: Mar 24, 2019 /	Ship was great, wait staff was great, only major problem we had was the housekeeping staff, he was the worst person I’ve ever had clean my room, very Rudy
5.0	Sail Date: Mar 24, 2019 /	This was my 2nd time on the Oasis, and 3rd on an Oasis class ship... And this ship is AWESOME as always!!  Went with older relatives, and RC staff at Port Canaveral and the Oasis staff took VERY good care of us all. The service was TOP NOTCH, the food was great and plentiful variety every day, the entertainment was ok.. They had a few technical glitches in a couple of the shows, but ehh crap happens, and they did well over coming it and still providing good entertainment. I just LOVE the Oasis and Oasis class ship!! I just can't see sailing on another class in the near future...  In fact I have two booked cruises... Harmony and TA on Allue in the next 12 month.. and excited to hear what the 5th Oasis ship is so I can boom the TA on it like we did on the Symphony when it was coming to the USA.
3.2	Sail Date: Mar 24, 2019 /	Cruising is not for everyone.  This is our 4th cruise with our last one being in 2006.  Prior to this cruise, we have been doing the all-inclusive, fly in and stay at the resort type of Caribbean trips.  As I get older I much prefer that kind of vacation.  Now I have to say we went with my daughter, son-in-law, and granddaughter, and this was their first cruise and they enjoyed it enough to book another cruise next year.  But not me and my wife.  Unless something drastic happens to change my mind, this will be my LAST cruise!
3.4	Sail Date: Mar 17, 2019 /	Overall Oasis is a nice ship.  The food and activities were ok, but the ship lacked a water slide.    The boardwalk area at the back of the ship was our favorite place.  A lot of the activities seem kind of dated...time to drag cruising into the 21st century?
4.4	Sail Date: Mar 17, 2019 /	Looking forward to the next cruise in June on the Allure.
2.7	Sail Date: Mar 17, 2019 /	Our accessible room was not there when we boarded were given run around by customer care on board and it was humiliating to use a public bathroom (and people who had staterooms and would bang on the door, sorry I'm in a wheelchair it takes a little longer.  Had to use spa for shower, as I am paralyzed, but only when opened I usually shower at 5-6am, would have been nice to keep our daily routine.
4.0	Sail Date: Mar 17, 2019 /	I was on Oasis of the Seas March 17 - 24, and we had a wonderful time and the ship was beautiful and the crew was nice. I have been on 20 cruises but the first with Royal Caribbean.  I did miss Guy burgers on Carnival and I missed their Omelets. Our cabin 10187 was spacious and the bed was comfortable. All their shows was very entertaining.
4.5	Sail Date: Mar 10, 2019 /	This was my first cruise and it was great! Always something to do. The destinations were gorgeous and you get to pick what you want to do at each location. The boat was not crowded with kids. Service staff were very accommodating and friendly. The ship was always very clean! I will definitely book another cruise with Royal Caribbean!
3.6	Sail Date: Mar 10, 2019 /	"I was travelling alone on this cruise. As mentioned the ship is very impressive, and great for family’s and groups. As a solo traveller I think the whole experience was lost on me. Usually I would meet up with fellow cruisers, or at least constantly bump into someone I’d previously met. Due to the vast size and venues on this vessel, that was not the case and never saw or spoke to anyone more than once.
This has not put me of Royal Caribbean as this was my first time cruising with them, but I, personally, would steer clear of any mega ship in future if travelling solo.
If anything needed looking into it would be the quality of the food, other than that it was really a great week and I have no regrets going."
4.9	Sail Date: Mar 10, 2019 /	This was our 23rd Anniversary cruise. We enjoyed everything the Oasis has to offer. This was indeed the best cruise experience we have had. We have cruised with Norwegian and Carnival in the past.
4.6	Sail Date: Mar 10, 2019 /	The Oasis did not disappoint....what great memories this mom and son made during our cruise adventure!  Can’t wait for out next one!
4.0	Sail Date: Mar 10, 2019 /	Overall, we really enjoyed this cruise.  I would probably prefer not to go on such a large ship in the future, but the amenities can't be beat.  However, running such a large operation, seemed to make the service suffer.
5.0	Sail Date: Mar 03, 2019 /	Waiting to disembark now and just wanted to say what an amazing time we had on this ship! Everything was wonderful from the crew to the entertainment. Never encountered any problems..can’t wait to come again!
5.0	Sail Date: Mar 03, 2019 /	We just returned from our cruise and I am already planning for the next. It exceeded my expectations! It was so depressing to wake up this morning with cold toes and no room service! Can't wait to go again.
4.2	Sail Date: Mar 03, 2019 /	Do you have a ship with open front and back to access view? Something smaller instead of changing cruise lines. I felt a little out of place with special stuff for the upper class. It was the most amazing ship and nothing like it. We Loved our time on it but could not do all those activities or get to either end of ship unless we were wealthy . Wanted to see us leaving out of port but first thing I see is Reserved sign to go to front of ship and wanted to be outside but soliumn was hot and crowded. No open air and access to front and back .
4.1	Sail Date: Mar 03, 2019 /	It was good/great ship. Windjammer the food was wonderful.  The main dining room was not all of that great on some nights.
5.0	Sail Date: Mar 03, 2019 /	I wish they would enforce the no kids in the Solarium better.
4.4	Sail Date: Mar 03, 2019 /	Great overall first cruise with family!  We are hooked🛳🏝
5.0	Sail Date: Mar 03, 2019 /	Best cruise experience my family and I experienced.  Looking forward to doing this again in the future.
3.7	Sail Date: Mar 03, 2019 /	This was our 28th cruise and liked royal Caribbean cruise line the best
3.0	Sail Date: Mar 03, 2019 /	Just got off of Oasis on 3/10.  Let me start by saying we had a great time, we are a family who truly enjoys our time together and appreciate it as it doesn't happen as often as we'd like.  But this will be an honest review.   We decided by day 5 that we definitely  would not do another Oasis Cruise.  4 balcony cabins with 2 adults in each cabin and 1 Central Park Balcony with 1 adult in it.  All on Deck 12.   Cabins were very nice.  My uncles Central Park Balcony was a bit tight for his scooter to get in and out, there were no more Handicapped accessible rooms available when we booked, hence problem #1 - not enough handicapped room for those who need them.  Very crowded ship.  I'll start with the good, just about everyone on the ship who worked on it were so pleasant.  The service was very good.  Our cabin attendant was ok.  We still tipped him very well before we debarked.  Our dining room attendants were great, couldn't have been nicer or more eager to make us happy, again they were tipped very generously.   Great desserts in Cafe Promenade, good pizza in Sorrento's, Central Park was very nice to walk at night.   Vintage had a very nice tapas menu and a nice wine tasting for an extra fee (even with drink package), our kids really enjoyed that.  Four of our family got the ultimate drink package and it was well worth every penny.   There is a drink package that they offered around day 3 for the remainder of the cruise, 10 drinks for $85.00 which you can share with friends and family.  (Just something to remember if you drink but don't want one of the larger drink packages.  Drinks ran between $8.00 & $12.00)  Of course the Love and Marriage show was hysterical.  NOW the not so good.....Not enough elevators for ALOT of people, especially if a show just got out.  We all felt we waited to long for elevators.  The day we got on the ship we needed to make dinner reservations and there was a very long lime with only 1 man at the desk making the reservations for everyone in line, this sucked because I wanted to join my family in the Solarium Bistro for lunch, which was just ok, not many choices but refused to wait on line for the Windjammer in the packed hall.  The pool chairs on Deck 16 are VERY close together, you practically have to crawl onto your chair to get onto it, hence the reason why we probably did not have problems getting chairs together, they pack them in.  The Solarium was very crowded and that is where we had problems getting chairs, even just one.  The Solarium looks so pretty in the pictures but it was my least favorite Solarium on any ship I've been on, RCCL, Carnival & Norweign. It was loud, most defiantly not a quiet solarium to sit and relax in, no breeze, not enough chairs (although there are 1,000's outside the solarium), chair cushions could most definetley use reupholstering, towel station should be opened more, 16 and older doesn't always mean 16 and older, the floor is very slippery when it is wet - which is all the time, it's a pool area, poor design, be very careful walking.  We were very disappointed in the Main Dining-room with the food.  One night 4 of us got swordfish and we all took one bite and ordered something else, it was awful, we felt like our server wasn't surprised whenever we asked her for a different meal.  The first night 5 ordered a strip steak from the menu and 4 were all over cooked 1 was raw.   We couldn't figured this out.  We feel like the ship is just so big and the mass amount of food that is put out suffers quality and presentation.  We ate in Chops one night, 3 of us ordered Lamb Chops medium rare and they all came out medium - no pink anywhere in the lamb, 3 said their meal was good & 3 said their meal was just ok.  None of us were really impressed with the food in Chops.  The Windjammer food was ok, if you were patient enough to wait on line to get in to eat it.  Crazy!!!  They actually would not let you go in until people walked out, then they brought you to an open table.  And the line was long!!  But all the workers were very pleasant.  Room Service is not free, EVERY TIME you order there is a $7.95 service charge, no matter how big or small the order.  The only thing that is free is the continental breakfast in the morning if ordered before 11:00am, coffee, teas, few juices, donuts & danishes, some hot & cold cereals.  Every person who delivered our orders were always friendly and pleasant.  We always got our orders in a timely manner.   Johnny Rockets is $12 per person, no matter if you just want one burger $12.00 or a burger, hot dog, fries, onion rings and a shake - $12.00!!   Lots of up selling on this ship.
4.1	Sail Date: Mar 03, 2019 /	The excursions were all great.  The ship was disappointing.
4.9	Sail Date: Mar 03, 2019 /	Overall the Oasis of the Seas is a very nice ship with many things to do.  Excellent choice for families and enough entertainment to keep everyone busy on sea days.
3.9	Sail Date: Feb 24, 2019 /	A very entertaining and relaxing cruise.  Food was good.  But the coffee left much to be desired
4.2	Sail Date: Feb 24, 2019 /	We were very disappointed about dinner in the dining room.  This was our first Royal Caribbean cruise.  We know others who sailed on this ship in the past and the food was fine.  The internet service was very poor.  I paid $120 for the week and could only send and receive email.  I was unable to post any pictures to Facebook.  I am glad that our next cruise in April is back on Princess.  I just hope their food has not deteriorated as well.
4.2	Sail Date: Feb 24, 2019 /	The ship is a experience but with 6000 people and 2000 crew, It’s a floating city.  We go to get away from schedules and reservations and we were exhausted from all the schedules we had to keep. It’s just to big and same ole ports.
4.0	Sail Date: Feb 24, 2019 /	Ship is nice but too big for me; lots of people although you don't feel it too much except by the elevators.  Food and service were lacking in the Main dining rooms.  Drinks and packages are too expensive; wish they offered some alternatives for those that don't need the full package.  Shows were good, especially the water, ice, comedians and headliner shows.  Need to do away with formal nights and go with smart casual; most don't dress up.  Didn't enjoy these islands, just getting too run down, except St Marteen.  Did overhear some staff saying they are not allowed to laugh and have fun with the passengets; need to be serious all the time. Casino is as they go, start out good but leave your money at the end. Boardwalk balcony was noisy and you can't see much unless at the back of the ship.  Lots of entertainment and activities so plan your days so you don't miss out.  The ship app for your phone didn't work most of the time and didn't allow texting other passengers, like some ships, needs an upgrade here.  Bottom line is you need to pay extra to get good food, drinks, coffee and tours.  One last thing that made us laugh was having to pay $2.50 for a small popcorn for the movies.... seriously.  Will stick to smaller ships that focus more on destinations and give you free packages.
5.0	Sail Date: Feb 24, 2019 /	Oasis is a wonderful ship with plenty of things to do. The food was very good and the service from the dining room, guest service, bars, stateroom attendants, etc was excellent. Mike the cruise director was hilarious and did a great job with shows and events. I really enjoyed my cruise on the Oasis of the Seas.
4.2	Sail Date: Feb 24, 2019 /	we get more than we expected and are looking for the next adventure next winter already.. cruising it's just perfect for us.
5.0	Sail Date: Feb 24, 2019 /	"it is one of the best 
ive only cruised with Royal and at this point 
no one else the customer service is brilliant"
3.9	Sail Date: Feb 24, 2019 /	I think in general the Oasis of the sea was a great ship.  My problem is that I have been cruising for so long, that what you have to pay extra for in a specialty restaurant, is what was served it the main dining room.
5.0	Sail Date: Feb 17, 2019 /	Labadee was our favorite port. It is the perfect place to lay back on the beach and soak up some sun.
5.0	Sail Date: Feb 17, 2019 /	relaxing, food was good, service was very good and nighttime shows were very good.
4.0	Sail Date: Feb 17, 2019 /	For the price best value in cruises. Lots of inclusions like soda package and boom internet.
4.6	Sail Date: Feb 17, 2019 /	We truly enjoyed our trip and can't wait to go again!
4.0	Sail Date: Feb 17, 2019 /	"This was our first cruise with Royal Caribbean. It was a good time but I don’t think I’d so so far as to say it was awesome.  The breakdown is as follows :

Entertainment 
“Come Away with Me” was really good. As was the Aquatheatre show.  “Cats” - like other reviewers mentioned - the performers were great, but the show itself was less enjoyable. The Headliner show was o.k. (Perhaps a little loud) and the comics were standard fare.  The ice show was impressive in that they performed quite well in the confined space of the small ice surface and told the story well. Some of the best performances on the ship were every evening in Dazzles where they had an 80s cover band that had quite the repertoire. The piano bar player/singer was also quite good. 

Activities 
A bit lacking here compared to other cruise lines. Sure there was things to do but nothing that was really “we got to go to this!”  We did the trivia, and comedy club, - no interest in the casino -, and of course the zip line, flowrider, arcade, card room, pools and the like.  It seemed to us though with a ship that big there could have been more/better programming.  

Food
Can’t really complain that the food was poor - it wasn’t - but it seemed to lack a certain “WOW” factor.  We always found enough and lots to eat but some cruises you just go “WOW THAT WAS GOOD” or unique, or impressive.  Didn’t really get that here. Just reliable I’d say.  Main dining was great but could have been excellent. Windjammers was good for a quick meal. Wipeout cafe, park cafe, sorentos, and cafe promenade were fine for a snack between meals.  Johnny Rockets was always busy but the meals there were not really better than other places on the ship. Ice cream seemed to run out at busy times (and when isn’t there busy times for ice cream!). Everything was just good - missing the OMG! for us anyway. 

Ports
We really liked the pace of the cruise. Sea day, port, sea day, port, etc.  Not too much at once.  Labadee was nice. The water was clear enough to enjoy snorkeling and the beach was crowded but ok.  Jamaica excursion (“Go Native”) was one of the highlights of our trip.  Great tour guide.  The organization prior to leaving the ship though was a bit chaotic. They organized us into groups on the ship and then turned us loose only to have to re-organize once we got on land. Bit of a mess.  Add to that multiple ships in port... ya, could have been done better. 

General 
The Royal Caribbean app was a mess.  Always seemed to drop internet and lose connection. Plus you always seemed to be getting nickel-and-dimed. From internet to specialty restaurants to room service to spa treatments to (heaven forbid) losing your pool towels - they always seemed to want to charge you for something. Communication on-board is difficult unless you have their internet plan - something other cruise lines (Disney) have figured out and included in the price.  Also the bar code scan technology should be replaced with RFID technology. It would make things quicker and simpler. Embarking and dis-embarking was smooth though. 

Overall I’d give it a mark of 78%."
4.0	Sail Date: Feb 10, 2019 /	"We enjoyed Oasis of the Sea SO much! Definitely a lot better experience than Serenade of the Sea! 

Embarkation at Port Canaveral was a breeze. Quick & Easy! 

We had a Boardwalk Balcony room on floor 8. Perfect location to bars and restaurants. Our room was 8321. 

We only ate in the main dining room once and we didn’t care for it at all. Food wasn’t hot and very mediocre at best. However we had the 3 night specialty dining package. Giovanni’s was good (I remembered it being better on Serenade), Chops was nice but we ate there again for lunch and it was even better. Our favorite was 150 Central Park! Sabor was just ok. And Johnny Rockets was awesome!!! With a balcony room there’s no charge which was a pleasant surprise. 

We had breakfast every morning from Park Cafe. Didn’t step foot in the Windjammer (I can’t stand buffets). We had deluxe drink packages we SO enjoyed the Vitality Cafe which with the deluxe package it includes fresh pressed juices, smoothies & protein drinks. I had a beet juice every morning! 

My husband LOVED the hot dog place. We ate at the Solarius Bistro 2 nights, it was pretty nice. I liked the atmosphere but buffet apps, salad & dessert.... you also need a reservation at dinner. 

We loved ALL the shows and entertainment! 
Everyone says how much they hated Cat’s. I don’t get this? It’s a musical so if you don’t like musicals you won’t like it. The actors are extremely talented. I’ve seen Cat’s on Broadway and this show on the ship is right up there with that! 

Come Fly with Me had some technical difficulties during but the breaks never lasts long. It was great. Loved the Oasis of Dreams dive show which we watched from our balcony. 

Book all your shows as soon as you are able to. We made that mistake on Serenade. The comedy show was hilarious! 

Our excursion at St Maarten was fun. We did the 3 Island speed boat snorkeling tour with lunch and it was really rough seas which made for a very bumpy ride. Our lunch experience at one of islands took forever. They weren’t prepared for our arrival, my fish came 30 min after everyone at my table. So annoying. But they gave us free beer to makeup for it. 

We rented a Jeep on St Thomas and explored Smith Bay on our own. It was fun and cheaper than anything offered through RC. We’ve been to the Bahamas so we didn’t book anything just hopped off the ship and enjoyed Pirate Republic Brewery. 

If you are driving to Port Canaveral we highly recommend parking with Cruisetime. It’s $8 a day and they shuttle to and from the port. Much cheaper than parking at the port! 

Disembarking was slow but smooth for the most part. We will remember to take our own bags off the boat next time to save some time. 

Can’t wait to book another cruise. SO FUN!"
5.0	Sail Date: Feb 10, 2019 /	See you on the next cruise. I always have a lot of fun on these cruises.
5.0	Sail Date: Feb 10, 2019 /	Outstanding!  Absolutely fabulous ship & crew!!!  We loved 💕Oasis!!!  Food was a definite 10!  We have been top tier Carnival diamond level for a long time & got tired of the many cutbacks & food choices/ quality going down, so we decided to try other cruise lines.  We were nervous as we had to schedule dining & shows on Oasis ahead of time, but with the app everything was super easy onboard. The ship is SO beautiful, food was absolutely outstanding (excellent quality in dining room), chops steakhouse and the Italian restaurant were beyond excellent. The staff were all so nice.  Room was perfect size.  Despite the ship being so big, everything was very well organized & we did not have long waits getting back on the ship from ports. Casino 🎰 was fun. Only complaint was on day of departure back home, there were two elderly ladies working at the port itself- they were extremely disorganized & they gave incorrect instructions & directions to a lot of people. However, this complaint is a port issue & not the ship.  We would DEFINITELY recommend Oasis of the Seas! 😀👍🏻
4.7	Sail Date: Feb 10, 2019 /	This was my first & I'm in love with the Cruise idea. I for sure will again be on another!
4.3	Sail Date: Feb 10, 2019 /	we enjoyed the cruise and the family time it afforded us. This is the 6 th cruise we have been on switching back from Carnival to Royal Caribbean. We have decided we enjoy carnival more because of the quiet locations of adult only decks outfitted with comfortable seating. We also enjoy the times of dining for buffets and food choices on Carnival better.
4.2	Sail Date: Feb 03, 2019 /	Overall a very good trip! Very clean, friendly and well run
5.0	Sail Date: Feb 03, 2019 /	This has to be the best ship we have cruised on. The people who worked on this one were exceptionally friendly. I believe this is the first time I feel like I made friends. The food was amazing, the best I’ve had on a cruise ship so far. Even the deserts were not only beautiful, but tasty! I highly recommend sailing on the Oasis.
4.8	Sail Date: Feb 03, 2019 /	This ship is our new favorite.  We were VERY worried about sailing in such a large ship.  We never felt crowded with so many options for things to do or beautiful place to relax and enjoy the ocean.  The ship is clean and well maintained.  The staff and customer service is outstanding.  The food and cocktails are fantastic.
4.1	Sail Date: Feb 03, 2019 /	Despite some of our snafooz that we ran into all in all it was a great vacation. Let's face it even your worst day on vacation is better than any day at work. Now that I know how Royal Caribbean works if I choose to ise them again I know what to do.  Beautiful ship and lovely people.
5.0	Sail Date: Feb 03, 2019 /	This was my birthday cruise and I was treated like a queen by everyone on board. I was treated very special by my waitress and the concierge in the Diamond Lounge. Then again in 150 Central Park at dinner I received such wonderful attention by the waiter. I love cruising!!
4.9	Sail Date: Feb 03, 2019 /	Wonderful first Royal experience. We would do it again. The staff and crew was fantastic.
4.5	Sail Date: Feb 03, 2019 /	Very nice cruise.
4.6	Sail Date: Feb 03, 2019 /	Overall, we really liked the cruise.  Liked the itinerary where you only have 1 sea day at max between ports.  The food all over the ship was great.  The crew and service were awesome.  The shows we saw were outstanding.
5.0	Sail Date: Feb 03, 2019 /	I loved this cruise.  When the time came to leave i didn't want to leave.  They had great food and activities for when you are at sea. My family and the group we went with enjoyed it so much. Thank you Royal Caribbean.
4.5	Sail Date: Feb 03, 2019 /	As a first time cruiser, I learned that the Oasis of the Seas was a great place to start - near the top of the ranks.  I don't believe I would cruise a smaller ship.
5.0	Sail Date: Feb 03, 2019 /	Still think this is the best  vacation a family can take. The bonding time was a blessing most importantly the memories will Last a lifetime.   😊🍾🍹🍷🥂🍍🚢👌
2.0	Sail Date: Feb 03, 2019 /	Thought the ship was too big. Not the cruise lines fault but found the people to be very disrespectful to others around them. Next time will opt for a smaller ship
4.9	Sail Date: Jan 27, 2019 /	This was a great cruise, even with bad weather on the first and last days- which you can’t control that anyways.. but at least there’s lots to do on the ship. The stops were great too, I can’t wait to visit St Thomas again
4.0	Sail Date: Jan 27, 2019 /	They need to work on communication and problem solving.
4.9	Sail Date: Jan 27, 2019 /	It was a wonderful cruise!  My hubby and I decided to go alone this time and have a quiet romantic vacation. This ship was great for that, and was also wonderful when we went as a group!
4.9	Sail Date: Jan 27, 2019 /	We had a great time.. got engaged and already booked our next one for our wedding.  I enjoyed every minute of it.  . Only problem we encountered was my fiance had ordered chocolate covered strawberries to be delivered ahead of time to surprise me and they never showed up after asking 3 times...so if you order ahead... double check with them before getting to your room.
4.8	Sail Date: Jan 20, 2019 /	Our experience was amazing we will absolutely travel Royal Caribbean again....especially in the Loft Suite.
3.2	Sail Date: Jan 20, 2019 /	"Overall, this was a great cruise on a beautiful ship.  Even though there were 9000 people on board, it never really felt that way except for early dining at times. The entertainment was fantastic.  
I will probably cruise one more time on this class of ship before I make my final opinion on sailing mega ships."
3.0	Sail Date: Jan 20, 2019 /	"Very Disappointed. 

We had sailed on Liberty of the Seas. This ship is bigger. We thought it had more to offer. However, bigger was not better.

We found Oasis ready for rehab. Carpets were stained. Drapes in our room were not clean. Furniture in the dining room was worn.

For the first time ever in sailing a dozen times on RC and 20+ with other lines, we felt rushed. Rushed at dinner, lunch and breakfast as they had to prepare for the next guests. 

For the first time ever there were no RC staff to help direct us on the dock for our shore excursion. We never once clearly heard a ship announcement. We never heard an announcement at all in our room. 

We did not like having to reserve a slot for evening entertainment, although we could understand the need for crowd control with this many passengers. 

I stopped to get an ice cream cone one afternoon and pointed out to the staff there were no cones left. The entire area was a mess, but I didn’t say that. They shrugged and asked me if I had tried the other side, which I never found. This was another first. RC staff usually goes out of their way to bring passengers what they want. 

It seemed there were not enough staff to properly serve the large number of passengers, which caused some of the staff to be overwhelmed to the point of indifference. 

We took our family with us on this cruise. I’m very sorry we picked this ship."
4.0	Sail Date: Jan 20, 2019 /	"We were aboard the Oasis of the Sea’s Western Caribbean cruise in July (just after the norovirus incident). The ship was cleaned from top to bottom and our party had no instances of illness, thankfully. 

I traveled with a friend and our children. My five year old had the time of her life, as did I. She enjoyed the pools, hot tubs, soft serve ice cream and the children’s programs for about a half hour at a time and I got to enjoy the solarium for those brief moments.  

The only complaint I’d have is the proximity of the smoking area to the pools. I personally do not like sitting down to relax and have gusts of wind stinking up the whole place or accidentally walking down the wrong side of the ship and having to hold my breath. 

We had an interior room and it was perfect. I would however spend the few extra dollars and get an ocean view balcony next time! 

The food was great. We had dinner in the main dining room a few times and also at the buffet. My 5 year old much preferred the buffet. The desserts, oh how I miss the desserts!! 

The shows were good. We saw everyone of them except Cats, which I believe would have been too long for my daughter. We both really enjoyed the Beatles tribute band and the ice skating show, Frozen in Time. 

The staff were friendly but I was told less personable on this ship (it is understandable when you think about just how many guests are aboard). Our stateroom attendant Janice was friendly and thorough. Our room was always neat and tidy. 

Overall I had an amazing time and will do it again one day."
1.0	Sail Date: Jan 13, 2019 /	Avoid! Avoid avoiding! the staff thinks they are untouchable! You cannot complain about them! If you ever roll your eyes on them they will call security on you and they will embarrass you! Security west a body cam as if they are police! It's hilarious!
4.9	Sail Date: Jan 13, 2019 /	For a first cruise, it was a learning experience. We enjoyed the trip and the ship had lots of activities all day. Loved coming into ports and experiencing the small cities.
4.5	Sail Date: Jan 13, 2019 /	Had a great time, it was very relaxing, right up until time to get off the ship!
4.8	Sail Date: Jan 13, 2019 /	"Sailing on the OASIS of the SEAS is really an unexplainable experience.  As many videos as we watched on youtube, it still did not prepare us for the massiveness of this ship.  There were 6025 passengers and 2170 crew and at no time did it ever feel that way.  They have the ""neighborhoods"" and venues all split up on the ship which directs people in all different directions throughout the day to disperse the crowds.  We booked another one the last night of the cruise.  Royal Carribean is very reputable for royal treatment and on a ship this size they were still able to uphold that reputation in our eyes!"
3.6	Sail Date: Jan 13, 2019 /	We are happy , easy going cruisers,  but this was not an experience we wish to repeat. Oasis is a fine ship we have sailed many times just a bad timing situation.
4.0	Sail Date: Jan 13, 2019 /	"I’ll start by saying we were on the Jan 13th sailing, which was right after the big norovirus incident.  

RCL emailed us and let us know of the situation and offered to move our booking to another cruise. Although with two days to go it would be pretty hard to just cancel all things considered.

Overall we had a great time, and really enjoyed ourselves on the cruise.  Our first sailing with RCL and our first “mega” ship!

I did read an interesting review before we left about the ship being inward facing, and have to say I see their point.  The promenade, Central Park and for the most part the boardwalk are the main three areas and really you cannot see any ocean from any of these areas.  You really don’t feel like your on a cruise ship and as a water/ocean lover I did really miss that.  The running track on deck five is almost all blocked by lifeboats with the exception of the aft section where you can see water.  We would go for a stroll back to here after dinner each night but I wish the ship would have more ocean facing opportunities.  

The ship was in full “sterilization” mode and at times it could be annoying but necessary.  The first five days the buffet was not self serve, everything from plates to a cookie
Had to be handed to you by a crew member.  Not necessarily the smoothest operation, and I noticed they had pulled people from “recreation” and “entertainment” into the Windjammer to assist and they clearly had NO clue what they were doing.  I asked one guy for some fries and he put five or six fries on my plate!!   Needless to say when the self serve embargo was lifted on day five it was like graduating from the kids table at Xmas dinner to the adult table!!

The crew was constantly sanitizing.  Sadly this meant surfaces were continually wet moist and sticky.  Got to the point where you didn’t want to touch anything, but maybe that was the desired effect. 

We got the four night specialty dining package and it was totally worth it.  

First night was Sabor, and the good was delicious and very plentiful and our server Ernesto as the best crew member we had the entire cruise!  He was so jovial and attentive and two other times we ran into him on the cruise he stopped to talk to us and see how we were!  Definitely ask for him if you try Sabor.

Next we did Izumi sushi but just ate a la carte and didn’t use our package.  The champagne lobster roll was so delicous.  Otherwise the sushi was run of the mill and the service was nothing out of the ordinary.  

Third night was Johnny Rockets for burgers!  One of the best burgers I’ve ever had anywhere let alone at sea.  The sides of cheese fries and onion rings were delicious as well.  Our waiter Sylvester was friendly and attentive.

Next was Chops which was my fav specialty dining as far as food.  Our waiter Benjamin was great and the food was exceptional.  The goat cheese salad was not at all what I expected and was super delicous.  Beginning to end a delicous meal with great personalized service.  Only drawback here was we were sat at a two top between two other two tops and it really felt like we were all on top of one another.  The annoying lady at the one table kept trying to engage us, not matter how much we tried to ignore her! 

150 Central Park was a close second, Definitley a much better lay out and super private tables with the giant high back chairs!! The food was on par with Chops but didn’t seem as adventurous?  Our waiter was not the best and seemed a bit snobbish.  He kept bringing us room temperature bottled water while I saw every other table get ice water?! Not sure what that was all about.  

Last night was at Giovanni’s.  We had forgotten about this restaurant because it wasn’t showing up on the app?  I mentioned it to then maître d and she said it was a glitch!  This is supposed to be family style service but was a party of two
It really doesn’t work.  My hubbys pescatarian and I hate mushrooms so turned out nothing we ordered was actually shareable.  For a pasta joint the pasta was probably the weakest I’d had all week.  My tagliatelle was way over cooked and tasted like a liptons sidekick!!   Hubby got the mussels and ended up being very sick all night.  Note to self: don’t order mussels on the last night of a 7 night cruise!!! Lol

Entertainment was hit and miss.  Cats was exceptional.  Of course you gotta understand that it is Cats and it’s weird to begin with.  The talent and production values were great.

Come fly with me was an old school cruise ship production show mixed with an attempt to “cirque” it up.  Overall entertaining and fun for what it was.

The headliner show was an acapella group that to me was not a headliner.  They reminded me of the other teams on Glee that lost at regionals.  And I do love a good acapella group.  This to me was not a headliner. 

The comedy show was ok.  First comedian was funny and had the room going but the second was the opposite.

Frozen in Time was a horribly cheesy ice capades at sea.  Everything from costumes to music to what little story there was was subpar.  The highlight was the same artist during the Princess and the Pea.  She should have just done the whole show!

Oasis of dreams water show was again a “cirque” wannabe.  Super cheesy music and horrible costuming, and bad choreo!  The few dives you saw were cool but not enough to make this show a must see.  

Had two really rude crew members, one at the shore excursion desk who when asked about an advertised excursion simply said “we don’t have that” 
umm ok

The other was the pizza girl at Sorrentos.  She was the most miserable and sour faced person I met all cruise.  

That leads me up to my biggest con for the oasis and that’s its food offerings.  Buffet would close at 8:45??? 
Then your options are Sorrentos and Promenade cafe.  So pizza or cold tiny sandwiches?!?

I went to Sorrentos one night after the show and they had no pepperoni, just vegetarian and prima vera (essentially same thing) 

So I left and walked around for 15 min and can back.  No pepperoni.  I asked the miserable girl when she might have some and she said 20-25 min???   Seriously the only food available and you don’t just have pizzas pumping out over and over? 20 minute wait?   I’m used to Norwegian where the buffets stay open late for late night snacks and O’Sheehans is open 24 hours with all kinds of delicous offerings.  

RCL you need to get your shit together when it comes to late night offerings!! I’m
On vacation I sleep in and stay up late and want options.  My guess is they are pushing the $7.95 surcharge for room service!! Tsk tsk.  

Only other con was the tv selections.  No free movies? $12 to rent one???  Really horrible tv stations too.  Again for those late nights when ya wanna chill this was lame!


Overall a good cruise and some great high points that outweighed the cons.  

Will we sail again with RCL, I’m not sure.  The lack of food options after 9pm is a definite issue.   Short of hoarding food in the room earlier in the day, I don’t understand this."
3.3	Sail Date: Jan 13, 2019 /	While the ports-of-call were nice and it was fun to visit the islands of the eastern Caribbean, our on-ship experience fell flat on Oasis of the Seas. I would not book a cruise on this ship, again.
4.3	Sail Date: Jan 06, 2019 /	I believe that the captain and crew did everything  possible to contain the gastrointestinal outbreak.  It was any fun taking care of a sick family, but all in all we had some good times on the cruise
4.5	Sail Date: Jan 06, 2019 /	It was relaxing and cut short and under the circumstances it went well!!! Will do again
5.0	Sail Date: Jan 06, 2019 /	Unfortunately, we we on the ship when the norovirus problem broke out. I can't put blame on the cruise line or the passengers because no one knows how it started. The staff handled the situation professionally and as thoroughly as any cruise company could. They definitely earned my respect. With that being said, I can say, we loved the food in the specialty dining restuarants.  (We didnt eat in the main dining room at all) . We thought 150 Park was the best followed by the hibachi at Izumi, Giovanis, Chops, Sabour, Johnny Rockets, windjammer. All the staff we dealt with were terrific and would go out of there way to help when needed. We saw all the shows except Cats. We enjoyed them all except Frozen in time because of technical issues they were having and seemed a bit old (we left during one of the technical issue pauses). The game shows were super fun and overall the entertainment was great. The only flaw in my opinion was Bingo was setup similiar to slot machines where the odds can be set rather than pure luck and random like normal Bingo.  We loved our balcony ocean view stateroom.  Although we did request a mattress topper because the bed seemed a bit hard for our taste. I was worried about motion sickness because i am very sensitive to this. I took ginger pills and never had a problem. We definitely over ate and appreciated the walk/jogging track around the ship to burn off some calories. We also took the stairs as much as possible which was definitely a workout.
5.0	Sail Date: Jan 06, 2019 /	Best Ship we had a room staff that was off the chart. His name was German turned a bad experience into a great one!! He went above and beyond on everything he did Thank you German Job well done.
5.0	Sail Date: Jan 06, 2019 /	Even though we were on the ship that had the norovirus outbreak (my husband was one of them), they did everything they could to make the best of it for everyone! It truly brought out everyone’s true colors and Royal Caribbean was fabulous on how they handled the unfortunate circumstance!
4.6	Sail Date: Jan 06, 2019 /	The ship was very nice.  The entertainment was better than the other cruise lines.  Food was the best we have ever had on a cruise.  Because of the size of the ship the embarkation and disembarkation was a little more difficult.
4.7	Sail Date: Jan 06, 2019 /	The staff was excellent , they work so hard , no one should ever complain against a staff member , they are hard working people 10-12 hour shift ,  no over time. They have one job to to for 7 month and that is to make us happy , so be nice and make sure you have enough money at the end to tip them a little extra even thou your gratuity is taken out everyday.. they deserve more.
4.6	Sail Date: Jan 06, 2019 /	This was my first cruise. Disappointed that I was able to go to all the ports. Because illness on the ship. Royal Caribbean did a wonderful job taking care of the passengers. I had a wonderful experience of going to the shows. There was a lot of things to do
4.7	Sail Date: Dec 30, 2018 /	This was our fourth cruise on the Oasis of the Seas and never disappointed. One cannot get bored on the mega ships, there is always something to do. Our room was clean and well apportioned and our Stateroom Attendant took great care of us during our stay. The ship had wonderful celebrations for New Year's Eve. Love the holiday cruises. Dining in MDR did not disappoint either. The newly redesigned menu truly has something for everyone. Our Waiter and Assistant waiter were friendly and attentive. Everything was served hot and tasty. Surprisingly, our luggage tag was called an hour earlier than promised, so we were able to disembark easily.
4.5	Sail Date: Dec 30, 2018 /	We went with a group of 10 for the holiday cruise. It was a great time and a wonderful New Years Eve. Too short.
4.4	Sail Date: Dec 30, 2018 /	Great cruise other than arriving into one port 1.5 hrs late and having our families most anticipated excursion of the cruise cancelled. Grandkids were really disappointed by that!
4.0	Sail Date: Dec 30, 2018 /	Had an amazing time with our family and friends on this ship! We went to st maarten, st thomas, and nassau in december/january. My only complaint is how far apart the elevators are and how spread out things are onboard. I wish that we didn't have to walk clear across the ship to get from the restaurant to the flowrider (that is where my dad spent most of his time). But, i do see why it makes sense to spread things out so that it doesn't become too crowded in one area of the ship. The food and service was incredible and the onboard activities were so exciting and filled every second of the trip. We were never bored (especially with ten minute walks between each event).
4.9	Sail Date: Dec 23, 2018 /	The cruise is still very great no matter how busy it is. All the ports were great and I had plan on going back.
5.0	Sail Date: Dec 23, 2018 /	My family and I went on Oasis over Christmas and it was just as great as I remember it. Fully booked and yet it was never too crowded that I couldn’t easily get around. Food was very good and all the ports were amazing.
4.4	Sail Date: Dec 23, 2018 /	It was a fun Christmas cruise.  I think Oasis will be even better after the refurbishment.   After sailing on Harmony, we really noticed the few special things that Oasis doesn’t have.   We missed the slides and Wonderland dining.  It was still a great ship and great fun.
5.0	Sail Date: Dec 23, 2018 /	Great stops beautiful ship. For as large as the ship is it doesn't seem crowded in the least. Excellent wait staff. I highly recommend Mr Sanchos in Cozumel. Would definitely do again.
4.7	Sail Date: Dec 23, 2018 /	Loved the ship, excursions, staff, shows, FOOD!!!!
3.0	Sail Date: Dec 23, 2018 /	After paying a premium price for a Christmas cruise for our family, I must say we were greatly disappointed with the lack of Christmas decorations on the ship.  Mainly, just 1 big Christmas tree, and a few hanging snow flakes, that was it. As for everything else, they did a great job.
4.9	Sail Date: Dec 23, 2018 /	Entire vacay at Christmas was everything I needed and more.
5.0	Sail Date: Dec 23, 2018 /	"Great ship
 Food was excellent. I would give the kids club a 2 star.  Friendly staff and nice rooms.  Bar tenders are fantastic and so was the server for dinner."
5.0	Sail Date: Dec 16, 2018 /	Memories made on an amazing vacation, will book again, such a wonderful experience!
4.0	Sail Date: Dec 16, 2018 /	"Overall still a great ship.  Noticed some improvement in buffet quality from earlier sailing. Had boardwalk balcony which was really a lot better experience than I anticipated.  It gave you a partial view of Ocean and you could sit on the balcony and watch shows in Aqua Theater and activity on boardwalk below.

Port Canaveral is not optimal if one is seeking a party vibe. For that, choose Miami/Lauderdale sailings.  The Cruise Director and entertainment staff are weak and unable to keep the fun going.  They can't even get the sail away party going.  Even the Quest was relatively weak.

The three night clubs were generally so so.  Dazzles fizzled (mature club w live cover band). Boleros was a Latin snooze fest (Latin dance club).  Typically Boleros is a great place to begin the evening.  The band must do funerals on land.  Almost all ballads.  The young Latinos who came on the first night were quickly bored and abandoned the place much of the week leaving it to a tiny few octogenarians tangoing.  

Blaze (disco) was generally ok although the DJ's playlist is tired and predictable.

They have a White Night. However Royal Caribbean tends to keep this a secret and doesn't tell anyone in advance. So very few people pack White clothing. The late-night party on white night was pretty nice and lively in the Solarium"
5.0	Sail Date: Dec 16, 2018 /	"This was my first cruise it was awesome!!! We went for 7 days I highly suggest seeing your doctor for a patch for anti nausea and sea band. Overalll this was a great experience. O
I can't wait to go again."
3.0	Sail Date: Dec 16, 2018 /	"Even though we learned cruising isn’t for us, we had a good time. We just got off of Oasis this morning. 

-Windjammer was decent and there was always a good selection to choose from. 
Sorrentos pizza was also good. 
Johnny Rockets was by far my favorite, staff was great, food was great, who can turn down bottomless fries? 
As for the main dining rooms, we skipped in completely, my fiancé is a picky person and we looked at the menus every night and everything was too fancy, stuff neither of us would probably eat. (Which is not the cruise liners fault.) That being said we only ate at the three restaurants mentioned above.
-We ended up upgrading our drink package on our first day to the deluxe drink package. At $480 per person for the week we expected it to cover what we would drink in alcohol. It wasn’t made clear that the drink package only covers drinks $13 and under. We realized after a few $2-3 charges. Watch out for that. 
-I do think there should be more drink machines around the ship. We were on deck 3 and if we wanted to fill our cup we had to either go to deck 6 or up to Windjammer. 
-
The ports were nice. We didn’t get off in Nassau, but we were impressed with St Thomas and St Maarten. I wish there had been more shopping other than big name jewelry stores but what can you expect? Also, I wish I would have known that multiple cruise ships were going to the same excursions. Magens bay was beautiful and we had a great time but it was so packed you could barely walk on the beach."
5.0	Sail Date: Dec 09, 2018 /	"Prior to our cruise I read a lot of reviews about the ship and the were a few recurring themes that I noticed. The first one was that the ship was showing its age. In my opinion, the ship looked great but of course it wasn't perfect. A few times the elevator button to our floor didn't work so we had to press it in the other side of the elevator (such an inconvenience! Haha!) When we first arrived, our closet door was stuck but someone came up and fixed it for us right away. So I guess in this way, yes, it's showing its age, but based on the reviews I'd read, I expected to see things falling apart all over the place.  It was nowhere near that. In fact, if I hadn't read it from other people, I never would have thought, ""wow this thing is really starting to get run down"" as others have said.

The second thing I read often is that the ship was crowded and the elevators took too long.  Again, I do not share this opinion. I thought the number of people at any one place at any given time was very acceptable. There was no time in seven days that I waited a long time for an elevator or for food or a show or anything else.  (And by the way, our sailing was sold out.) There are two banks of six elevators on each end of the ship for a total of 24 elevators. And they're quick. It was never an issue. The closest it came to being a ""problem"" was whenever a major show let out and hundreds of people were exiting simultaneously. This seems normal to me and to be honest, it wasn't really bad. Things moved along smoothly.

The third thing I see a lot of is comments about the food. Well .... I think they may be on to something there. One of the beauties of being on a cruise is the fabulous food. Well now that these ships are offering so many premium specialty restaurants, I think they may be lowering the standards in the main dining rooms. This probably encourages people to pay for the specialty restaurants, which they wouldn't be inclined to do if the main dining room was fabulous.  Not only was the food average in flavor, there were at least two nights that the menu was so unappealing, I really couldn't even choose anything. The first time, we ate at the buffet instead. The second time I just ordered two side dishes and no entree. The wait staff was amazing, as always, and went above and beyond to make sure we had everything we needed. And we were seated with the nicest couple -- our table mates are our newest friends for life. 

So yeah, the food in the main dining room is not the to-die-for selections of yesteryear but it's certainly not terrible. It probably does help them sell specialty dining packages, though.

Other thoughts:. 

There was always enough seating in the pool areas. 

The jogging track was pretty cool and not crowded.  

Labadee is a silly ""port"" in that it's just more ship on land. We got off, laid on the beach for an hour and went back because we realized that this was the perfect time to enjoy the pool on the ship.  There's nothing else to do there besides getting harassed by the market owners that won't let you just look at their wares. If you've heard they're obnoxious, it's an understatement. If you say, ""No thanks"" or tell them you'd like to just look around they say, ""Don't be afraid! Look I have the perfect thing for you, you're going to love it!"" And they keep putting things in your hands.  It was ridiculous.

We had a rainy day in Jamaica so we didn't do much there other than shop. I will say that the rum cake is delicious and my awesome table mates told us to be sure to get them from the actual rum cake store. Same cake, but the other stores sell them at a decent markup. Good advice!

Other good advice:

Take cash with you into port. You can use USD with no problem and most places take credit cards but they add a significant fee that will usually negate any deals you may have negotiated.

If you need more cash, there's an ATM on the ship but the fees are insane. To circumvent this, go to the casino, buy chips and then cash them in. Voila! Same net effect, no exorbitant fees.

As you may have heard, there are lots of prescription meds you can buy over the counter in Mexico. They do not sell narcotics (other than Tramadol) and whatever you buy, you can take with you back on the ship with no issues. You are required to declare them at Customs once you get home and I understand they only have issues if you buy a large quantity.  They don't want anyone reselling them. 

Some medications do require a prescription. I've read that they often have a doctor on staff that will write one for you for a very small fee, but I didn't do this myself sure I can't verify.  I did try to refill a prescription there since I'm currently uninsured but I didn't bring the empty bottle with me so they wouldn't do it.  Apparently they would have if I had been better prepared.  Be sure to check the prices though because it's not always cheaper to go this route. And as for regular OTC meds (Tylenol, Advil) I was told they were way more expensive than buying in the US, but I didn't even think to verify this myself.  

Big tip here:  Go to a chain drug store, not the little ones on the main tourist strip. There's no 100% guarantee that you'll be getting authentic meds anywhere but with the chain stores you stand a much better chance of not getting ripped off. If you can buy medication, a t-shirt, a postcard, and get a free shot of tequila from the same guy, this is probably not your best option. (At least not for the meds anyway, ha!). And again, pay with cash.

But back to the review of the ship.  It is a resort and shopping mall on water. This is awesome to some people and doesn't appeal to others. Just be aware before you book on a megaship that that's exactly what it is. I personally enjoyed it and actually found it pretty amszing, but my next cruise is booked on a much smaller one.  

Variety is the spice of life, right?"
4.0	Sail Date: Dec 09, 2018 /	I very much enjoyed this cruise. The teen program was spectacular! My favorite dining venue was definitely the Park Cafe. This cafe you could just go up and ask for food and you could eat there or go to your cabin with it; it was very convenient. My only problems with this ship are that the food was not the best and the Windjammer is always very crowded. On several occasions you had to be seated because the tables were all being used. Other than those problems, everything else about the ship was amazing. I would recommend this ship to everyone who doesn't care much about going to the Windjammer Cafe and would rather go to other venues.
4.2	Sail Date: Dec 09, 2018 /	I am hooked on cruising and have already booked our next cruise in 2020.
4.0	Sail Date: Dec 09, 2018 /	"Cruised solo on Lady O in December of 2018. This ship is amazing!  Always something to do. Some of the nightly entertainment could use some changes. I thought ""come fly with me"" was fantastic as was the diving show. The comedians were hilarious. I never got to see frozen in time and skipped going to Cats because so many negative reviews. I thought the headline performer was talented but his music was tailored to a very specific demographic and I wasn't part of it so I was a little disappointed with that show.  Love and marriage, the quest, perfect couple game shows were all funny. Lady O is showing her age a bit in certain areas but it seemed like the maintenance guys were doing everything they could to keep her in the best shape possible. Cant wait to cruise on her again in December of 2020."
4.7	Sail Date: Dec 09, 2018 /	"Never a dull moment on the cruise unless you wanted one
 Staff was so friendly and helpful and knowledgeable and always had good advice."
4.0	Sail Date: Dec 09, 2018 /	Only problem was debarkation. Five stars for everything else.
3.0	Sail Date: Dec 09, 2018 /	Hubby and I was just in Cozumel on Friday, we did the dune buggy,snorkel and beach excursion. It was an okay excursion! The Dune buggy was kinda hard to drive. The beach that was included was very rocky and the snorkeling was ok.
3.8	Sail Date: Dec 09, 2018 /	"Cruise was good would only go V.I.P. Everything was included didn’t like the smoking on the ship that’s definitely put me off traveling again with them not enough staff to ask questions to so you was just left doing your own thing but I can say the food was hot and not warm when you got it but we was in the Coastle kitchen so no complaints with the food in there.
Would I go again not sure 🤔 oh and TV terrible and to watch a movie $11.99 which was way over priced!"
2.6	Sail Date: Dec 09, 2018 /	"The two of us got onboard Oasis on 12/9 to enjoy the 8-day Western Caribbean tour. Overall, the experience was positive, as 85-90% of the trip was well organized and executed. The reason for 2-star rating were those few situations which RC could resolve, but they apparently have chosen not to.

The ship was spacious, well maintained, and with a lot of amenities. Plenty of activities to choose from. Quality entertainment. Decent dinning options. Our stateroom was in great shape. The ship crew was exceptional.

On the negative end, dinning arrangements did not always function properly. WindJammer Marketplace, being the main dinning option on the ship, was designed  inadequately, often crowded and introducing long waiting times. 
On multiple occasions waiting staff hijacked our attention while we were eating to advertise premium dinning choices. This practice was completely unacceptable since we felt cornered and were left without options, except to either be rude toward them, or put up with their efforts to upsell. In general, the campaign geared toward advertising and squeezing every dollar possible out of passengers' pockets, as orchestrated by RC, was a bit cheap and tasteless. Paid arrangements must be commercial free.
Finally, the alcohol policy. We all know why most companies do not allow it onboard, and while there is a strong argument, both pro- and against bringing alcohol on the ship, there is absolutely no legitimate reason for RC to confiscate it from passengers (as they actually do). Prohibiting the consumption of bring-your-own alcohol in staterooms is quite outrageous.

Apart from these few 'ethical' nuances, the journey was a pleasure. The professional crew, the variety of ship amenities, and the availability of entertainment options will satisfy most tastes. A 'hidden gem', the Delight Duo, performs classical pieces almost daily in Central Park on deck #8. Highly recommended to all who enjoy listening this music genre!"
4.6	Sail Date: Dec 09, 2018 /	We will most definitely sail again on this ship or another Oasis class ship in the future.  This was perhaps the greatest cruise experience my wife and I have had during our brief cruising lifetime, but with Royal Caribbean, cruising could become a yearly vacation.
3.0	Sail Date: Dec 09, 2018 /	Boring. The shows were the same all week. This is a great cruise for the older adult, but the night life is slow. Sorrento's pizza is definitely the best pizza ever! The dining experience was really good and Schrooners bar is excellent.
4.8	Sail Date: Dec 09, 2018 /	Wonderful, staff and stateroom attendant.  Came home happy and relaxed!
4.0	Sail Date: Dec 09, 2018 /	Just got off of Oasis of the Seas, my first Royal cruise. I had an awesome time. It was most of the things people told be it would be. The ship, entertainment, activities were outstanding in all areas and for all ages!  Over 6000 people on the ship and never any lines worth mentioning...amazing! The ship itself lived up to all the hype. However, surprisingly all of the included food for me was sub par. Maybe I'm just used to Carnival making everything right there...long lines come with that but its fresh. Windjammer and Main Dinning staff were terrific but across the ship overall just not as friendly, kind and talkative as I'm used to. Our whole group  missed the cabin stewards calling us by name and knowing our habits and adjusting to us throughout the week...and lastly the level of cleanliness and attention to detail isn't comparable at all but it didn't impact my level of enjoyment. Overall we had a spectacular time but it didn't convert me into a Royal loyalist like most said would happen but we will cruise Royal again someday!
5.0	Sail Date: Dec 09, 2018 /	Had an amazing time on an amazing ship , there's so much to do you never get bored . The staff are so friendly an polite . If i had one gripe it would be that when at evening dining on Formal nights you really dont want the compare shouting in a microphone telling you to clap and thank the cooking staff as they dance through the restaurant .....it happened a few times
3.6	Sail Date: Dec 09, 2018 /	This was the worse cruise we've ever been on. We will never take another Royal Caribbean cruise. It's sad to wait so long to go on a cruise that is so costly for people on a fixed income and have such a poor experience.
4.0	Sail Date: Dec 02, 2018 /	Had a great time on the Oasis of the Seas. First time on this ship and we loved it!!! Can’t wait to book our next cruise. Plenty of venues and activities to do on board. Loved St Maarten!!!
5.0	Sail Date: Dec 02, 2018 /	"Excellent MDR service. Our server, Ernesto, really made our evenings enjoyable. He went the extra mile for us. 

Our room attendant didn't introduce himself and we rarely saw him. He did not replace our used cups in room, just put new lids on them. Otherwise, the room was kept clean. 

The Solarium was a nice, quiet break from all of the children running about the ship. Beautiful whirlpools, chairs to lounge in, and plenty of space for quiet reading.

The Oasis of Dreams show is not to be missed. Fantastic! The comedians were  funny too. My cheeks hurt from laughing so much. We went to the adult showing. If you do not want to be roasted and you have sensitive feelings, then do not sit in the front row. They really zinged some people! 

Our ship had a medical emergency and had to turn around to the port at which we just departed, but the captain made up for our late arrival to the next port by giving us extra hours in port the next day. Passengers were grumbling about the inconvenience, but a medical emergency is more important than a few hours of a vacation. 

Central Park is beautiful. We saw live birds and lizards in the bushes. The Boardwalk was a carnival-like atmosphere. 

We would definitely return to the Oasis, as we feel that we did not see all of the ship. Only on the 6th day, we discovered more shops and places to eat."
3.0	Sail Date: Dec 02, 2018 /	"Pros..The MDR food and service was top notch.
The employees were fantastic . Getting on and off was a breeze. Loved the shows ( didn't see Cats). Loves the jacuzzis were fun. Loved all the bands and clubs.
Cons.....the balcony room was tiny 10188. I felt like I was in small RV. The room never got cold even with curtains drawn. The frig in the room never got cold .no bodywash, shampoo/ cond was the worst.
Arcades we're pathetic for a ship thAt big and did t work half the time. Overall loved the cuise except for the room. Would pick a ship with better room."
5.0	Sail Date: Dec 02, 2018 /	One word...WOW!! This ship was amazing!! Not only is it beautiful...but there is so much to do..I didn't even feel like I was on a ship! And the staff was so sweet!! I know they get paid to be nice...but they really went above and beyond...especially when they found out it was my first cruise...they made sure I had a good time...and their kindness was genuine..will definitely be going again!
5.0	Sail Date: Dec 02, 2018 /	The ship was mega big. When I first walked onboard I thought that the royal promenade looks like a mall. The promenade was so bright all the time. Central Park looked amazing especially at night especially when there is some sort of lights that light up Central Park. The Oasis of dreams aqua show was so spectacular and amazing, I have never seen anything like that before. I was surprised to see that there was an actual Starbucks onboard and that the Starbucks actually accepts not only seas pass cards but also accepts the Starbucks gift cards and Starbucks app. The coffee drinks that is made at the Starbucks at sea taste the same as on-land. Boardwalk was also amazing and is not like anything where I live. I can’t wait to go on my next cruise Aboard Allure OTS in this coming April.
3.8	Sail Date: Dec 02, 2018 /	We had a good time, kids really enjoyed themselves. My wife and I were a little disappointed in the overall level of food but overall we had a good experience.
4.6	Sail Date: Nov 25, 2018 /	I don’t like the reservation method for shows, and there were lines, but we got good seats even standby.  The ice shows and aquatics shows were great.  A week wasn’t long enough for me to explore the ship.
4.3	Sail Date: Nov 25, 2018 /	We loved the ship layout. Our state room was spacious and our room attendant was very attentive. We loved the ports and had never been to a couple of them. We were a little disappointed that we missed out on the cruise critic meet and mingle. I was sent an email by Royal Caribbean stating that I would receive an invite in my state room. We didn't receive one and actually forgot about it. Not a big deal , but on other cruises we have been notified of time and place prior to boarding the ship. All in all a great experience and we will cruise with Royal Caribbean  again.
5.0	Sail Date: Nov 25, 2018 /	Great!! We had an exciting time with friends and family. Not to include many new friends we have met onboard.
2.6	Sail Date: Nov 25, 2018 /	"Where should I start 
The crew was  lazy and rude. The offerciers were rude.
Dirty dishes. Disembarkation  was a joke
I walked  off the ship and everyone had to walk all the around to the other side of the ship.
I have cruised for years. Several times on Oasis and I can not even been to express my disappointment."
5.0	Sail Date: Nov 25, 2018 /	"MY WIFE & I HAVE BEEN ON THIS CRUISE MANY TIME 
IT IS ALWAYS GREAT"
4.9	Sail Date: Nov 25, 2018 /	Wonderful vacation.  Ship is gigantic with lots to do.
5.0	Sail Date: Nov 18, 2018 /	First time on Royal Caribbean. Oasis is a great ship. Beautifully decorated, good layout and clean. Only place that was crowded was the windjammer. I chose my time dining because I want to be able to eat when I was hungry not at a certain time and was very disappointed that you really need to make reservations. Our room Stewart, Richard was awesome. All personal were very nice. Love Royal Caribbean and Oasis.
4.3	Sail Date: Nov 18, 2018 /	"We went on an eastern Caribbean cruise. We had a wonderful time overall, but we were both disappointed with the food in the mdr, the windjammer and the solarium. It was just okay or not really good at all. We ate several of our meals in the specialty restaurants. We ate at Chops, Giovanni's and 150 Central Park. All three were delicious and had great service. Our two favorites were Giovanni's and 150 Central Park. 

Our room steward, Laverne was absolutely wonderful. She always has a smile for you. She has a very wonderful attitude and added to our whole experience. 

The casino is a lot of fun, but those slot machines like to giveth and taketh away. 🤨 Cats was not good. The dive show and other shows around the ship were much better.

This was my first cruise and I have to say as someone who went in not knowing if I was going to like cruising, I had a fabulous time. I would cruise on this ship again in a heartbeat. As a matter of fact, I enjoyed cruising so much that we have already booked another cruise on a different ship for January 2020."
3.3	Sail Date: Nov 18, 2018 /	Over all, the cruise was fine, nothing spectacular but still, no real complaints.
5.0	Sail Date: Nov 11, 2018 /	We always use Royal Carribean. A suite is more money but for us the perks you get with it are worth the price. You have a suite sunning deck section that is never crowded in all of the cruises we have taken. Being on the 17th floor you have the suite louge right there to get coffee and drinks when you want. Windjammer is one flight of stairs down. So is the outside deck to walk the the suite sunning area. The floor has doors to get onto it so it is very quite. The halls are much wider as well.
4.9	Sail Date: Nov 11, 2018 /	The only complaint we had is the pineapple juice in most of the bars was too watery
4.9	Sail Date: Nov 11, 2018 /	We loved the cabin, location of 6706 and quietness.  It was convenient to many venues.  We were in line at port at 10:45 and in the ship by 11:30.  Cabin steward was good, food good all around.  Food in Windjammer was better than we have ever experienced and although I have multiple food allergies I was always able to find something good. Our 4th cruise and it was top notch!  Really close to perfect!
5.0	Sail Date: Nov 11, 2018 /	Awesome cruise. There were so many activities to do on board! The ports were amazing and I had so much fun.
4.8	Sail Date: Nov 11, 2018 /	Cabin was awesome, service was great (especially the dining & bar staff), and the ship was impressive.
4.2	Sail Date: Nov 11, 2018 /	"First time on RC after several years on Carnival.  Won't go back, have already booked on RC for next year.  Carnival is fine, but it's way too in your face partying for our tastes.  RC feels a bit more upscale and laid back.  One thought we keep circling back to, seems small but on Carnival, you just about can't navigate through the main deck without passing by the casino and dealing with SMOKE.  On this ship, you pretty much had to go looking for the casino.  Again, it's a small thing but it kind of illustrates my ""in your face"" comment above.  Final comment - was concerned about the number of guests on a ship of this size, but we never felt crowded anywhere on board.  Only times you felt the crowd was embarkation and debarkation."
5.0	Sail Date: Nov 11, 2018 /	Wonderful ship , amazing shows and a very friendly staff, my only  advise is to be aware of the free consultations and seminars because at the end of  the session the provided will transform from a very nice person to the most aggressive  salesperson trying to sell something well overprice.
4.0	Sail Date: Nov 11, 2018 /	"Over all a great trip. The ship although huge doesn’t feel huge. We loved the different neighborhoods. Central Park was mine and my hubs favorite. Our cabin was right by it and we’d walk to Park Cafe and get our coffee every morning and sit at night with drink and listen to music. Boardwalk and adventures ocean was our girls favorite. They would do face painting and balloon animals on the boardwalk and of course the rode the carousel a million times. Nothing felt too over crowded. There is lots of good to the ship. The best being how kid friendly it was. From Dreamworks characters to parades to how special they made the kids feel. We chose this ship since it was our kids first cruise and it did not disappoint. However there is some bad. I heard it’s going soon to get an overhaul which is good. It is in definite need of new carpets, chairs, etc. Lots of torn, broke and stained things around the ship. Also ventilation for smoking areas could be much better. Also the food was not great. Almost not even good.

Staff
In general the staff were AMAZING! Our favorite, “Aladdin” in Adventure Ocean. If you have kids they will love him! I love that even someone just wiping the table off does it with a smile. If my daughter was dancing through a room they would dance with her. They help make your vacation a truly happy relaxed one!

Stateroom
We were in 8570... this was my least favorite part of our trip. Unfortunately we had a nasty smelling/dirty room. There were shelves full of dust with things left over from previous guests. The toilet was stained black... not exaggerating! And our steward wasn’t great. Several times picked our wet towels off the floor and rehung them. And as you know towels don’t dry quick in a cabin room plus they were on the floor for a reason! So going to grab and dry off with what you thought was a clean dry towel and surprise it’s wet, not fun. She left her cleaning rags in our room. Just a lot of little things. BUT this is the exception. We have had great steward/room experiences. Just not this time.

Food
Not great. I wish they’d go more quality over quantity. The Main dining room is the best out of complimentary food. But with the kids not wanting to sit for 2 hours we only ate there on formal nights and 2 times for breakfast. Once al la cart and once buffet. The windjammer is horrible except for breakfast. It was our favorite for breakfast out of main dining, windjammer and park cafe. But seriously only breakfast. The rest of the time disgusting. There is a huge selection but nothing taste good. Even the desserts. My kids never finished dessert. Looks amazing then they’d take a bite and say gross. We ate once at Johnny Rockets it was really good and not outrageous in price. We also ate at Sabor. HIGHLY recommend it! You can have as many appetizers and sides as you want to try plus your main. Everything we had was amazing. The kids had cheese quesadillas and LOVED them. You will most likely not be able to finish your food. They give you so much! You get what you pay for and then some!

Drink package
I’d do this again in a heartbeat! Especially for my hubs and I. We got it for the girls too, so they could get virgin drinks and smoothies whenever they want. But they got so many without having to use their sea pass card it almost wasn’t worth it. Pays to be young and cute, lol.

Shows/entertainment
Some things I wondered about before I got on the ship... white party, 70’s night, Pirate parade...

White party... don’t bother bringing white specifically for this. Barely anyone dressed in white including the staff member directing it. It lasted about 15 min and was all line dancing. And then it was over.

Pirate parade... this was only for the kids age 6-8 from adventures ocean. They are the ones that parade through the promenade. However it is so stinking cute!! And funny! My daughter was part of it. Even if you don’t have kids check them out. They have a whole skit and dance. “Aladdin” led them which was even better! But don’t worry about bringing pirate costume or anything for the kids.

70’s dance party...
This is on the promenade and packed full of people. This was a good time! Lots of energy. They thrown light up rings down to the crowd. If you like music and dancing this is a fun time

Cats we avoided because of the reviews and then several we talked to on the ship said they went and hated it.

Frozen in Time, AWESOME don’t miss!!!

Oasis of Dreams, AWESOME don’t miss!!!

Come fly with me... mixed review it was like this show couldn’t make up its mind what kind of show it was suppose to be. I have no idea what it’s supposed to even be about. There was a really cool set and act and then go to a weird not good singing session. But I guess there was supposed to be a hot air balloon and aerialist doing stunts that never happened. So we just didn’t get the whole show. 
A few entertainers got hurt in shows during our trip. A couple of aerialist and an ice skater who had to get air lifted in Cozumel. So this had some effect on the shows that took place in the last half of the week.

We also loved the family friendly comedy show. Dan Wilson was hilarious!

If you are doing a family vacay with kids you’re going to love this ship. All the staff cater to them. Even taking a lot of time and patience helping them learn the flow rider or  zip lining. No one treated them like a burden or rushed them through anything. Also there are small wonders around the ship they will love looking for. As adults we really liked it too. But I don’t think we’d chose this ship again if it were just us adults. Hopefully this review helped a little!
Happy cruising!"
2.5	Sail Date: Nov 11, 2018 /	We went on this cruise to celebrate our 46th anniversary.  This was our 6th cruise.  We had to dine in the dining room every night with noisy bratty undisciplined kids.  We complained to quest services.  Complaining did no good.  The air conditioning in our cabin did not work very well.  It was very hot at night in our cabin.  The shows were not very good.  There were children running around the ship unsupervised.  We were afraid they would knock us down.  One of the At Sea days was very boring.  The disembarkation was awful.  Long slow moving line getting off ship.  A much longer slow moving line at customs.
4.8	Sail Date: Nov 04, 2018 /	Our 91 year old mother took her children and their spouses on this trip - 13 of us.  Things worked out very well during the week.  I had to request a wheelchair the 2nd day and they had it at her cabin very quickly.
5.0	Sail Date: Nov 04, 2018 /	I loved this ship. She is so beautiful and the staff were amazing. I would sail on her again in a heartbeat. My favorite places were the solarium and the cantilevered hot tubs.
4.0	Sail Date: Nov 04, 2018 /	Oasis is a great ship to explore and have fun on, if a little tired looking in places, never felt crowded with loads to do, really enjoyed it overall.
5.0	Sail Date: Nov 04, 2018 /	"We took our first cruise on November 4th on the Oasis of the Seas. We sailed the Eastern Caribbean with ports in Nassau, St Thomas, and St Maarten. 

I could not recommend this cruise highly enough. 

The ship was amazing. It felt like a floating casino. 

The Dining Room, Windjammer Cafe, and Solarium Cafe were incredible. We especially enjoyed the formal nights. Both service and food were top notch. 

The entertainment was also great. We couldn’t fit all the events & activities we wanted to do in our seven days. 

The headliner, Mo5iac, water show, Oasis of Dreams, and aerial act, Come Fly With Me were very fun to watch. 

The (18+) game shows had my wife and I both crying from laughing. 

We opted for the drink package and found it to be totally worth it, even if you don’t reach your 15 drink limit. 

My wife and both felt spoiled by the ship, staff, and service, and can’t wait to book our next Royal Caribbean cruise."
4.0	Sail Date: Nov 04, 2018 /	This was a huge ship. Beautiful! And so much to do. Overall we enjoyed it a lot. The only thing we we're disappointed in was the food. Hot food was Luke warm, cool fool was Luke warm. The quality of non-specialty food was mediocre. The specialty restaurant s were perfect. We may go back but we would have to have a good deal. To make up for the food.
4.4	Sail Date: Nov 04, 2018 /	Enjoyed the cruise but did notice that service has been cut and selection of food is not as good as it once was.
4.6	Sail Date: Nov 04, 2018 /	Loved the Oasis of the Seas, was a much bigger ship than expected. The stage was great but be sure and buy the drink package before you leave when its 50% off otherwise its higher. If your traveling light and only taking one suitcase per person you can just roll your luggage on board yourself and avoid having to wait for the staff to bring it to your room plus you avoid the risk of loosing your luggage and yes it does happen. Be sure and reserve the shows you want to go see early as they sell out fast. Make your dining room reservations before you leave so that you have a specific table and time everyday to avoid the hassle of anytime dining and waiting in lines. Done overpack your suitcases as you really dont need as many clothes as you think. The pictures on board are plenty but a 8x10 will coast you $20.00 per picture. The gift shops have 50% off sale at the end of the cruise so dont buy at the beginning as you will save by waiting for the sales. There are 6000k people on the ship with you so be patient and realize that things are not going to be perfect. We hear people saying things like i cant believe the mustard dispenser ran out of mustard......really people get over it as some will find SOMETHING to complain about no matter how small and this person said that ruined their vacation..... again world peace is a life tragedy running out of mustard which only needed to be filled as you and thousand others are all using it is not life altering or worth the drama...... if you dont believe then read some of the other reviews and you see all the drama queens in full action...... overall the vacation was wonderful and cant wait to do another one in a few months...... Enjoy each day as its your last and you will see you dont need to sweat the small stuff and not to pet the sweaty stuff in life as its all small stuff.....Enjoy your cruise and be a blessing to all you meet and your life will be one of joy peace and happiness!!!!
4.0	Sail Date: Nov 04, 2018 /	Wonderful ship, very easy to navigate. Friendly crew and great itineraries! Ship is 10 years old and ready for a refreshment she is getting next year.
3.9	Sail Date: Nov 04, 2018 /	We called maintenance many times because batteries in the door lock kept breaking and we couldn't get in. Batteries in the safe broke and we couldn't get our passports. Random calls to maintenance. Also, the workers. Ugh. The girl taking care of us was amazing. The rest. Ugh. The pizza guy threw pizza at me. Medical was ridiculous. The people running the rock wall were awful. And if you plan on doing an excursion plan on standing for an hour before doing anything. And they charged my kids for alcoholic drinks, even though my kids had the deluxe drink package. Overall, 1-10. I'd give it a 4.
5.0	Sail Date: Nov 04, 2018 /	This ship is beautiful! The people who say she's showing her age must be looking really hard to find something.  I thought it was in great condition and SO clean! The staff members are constantly cleaning, scrubbing, painting and powerwashing.  The food was excellent and if you are looking for a quiet place for dinner with amazing food check out the Solarium. They take reservations and there is no extra fee. There are so many activities we didnt have time to do it all so we rebooked for next year!
3.8	Sail Date: Nov 04, 2018 /	Nice vacation, but boat may be too big to get the quality service needed.
4.9	Sail Date: Oct 28, 2018 /	We will miss the Oasis next year but we're are already looking forward to finding and exploring new sights and tastes and views from the Harmony of the Seas. Making New Memories.
4.6	Sail Date: Oct 28, 2018 /	We went on Oasis last year to the Western Caribbean and fell in love with her. 7 days is just not enough time!
4.7	Sail Date: Oct 28, 2018 /	Took my husband on his first cruise..and he loved it! This was my first trip on an Oasis class ship...my previous 10 or so cruises were on Voyager class and smaller ships. The Oasis is beautiful and I’m glad I got to experience it...so much to see and do! Make sure you make time to explore everything it has to offer!
3.8	Sail Date: Oct 28, 2018 /	This boat is wonderful.  The staff were exceptional and we wish we could have never left.
4.8	Sail Date: Oct 28, 2018 /	We absolutely love going on the ship for Halloween. So many people got involved this year and dressed up for the parade. We love this ship and all the activities available for everyone.
4.9	Sail Date: Oct 28, 2018 /	Royal Caribbean and the Oasis of the Seas never fails to disappoint.  From the food to the service to the entertainment were all outstanding.  The crew always says hello or acknowledges you when you are walking down the hallway or walking on deck.  The shows were great, especially the Aqua Show.  The Halloween party and parade were first class.  Literally 2/3 or the passengers, approximately 4000 folks, dressed up for the festivities.  We have 5 or 6 more Royal Caribbean cruises on deck, including one in three weeks, and we will continue to sail with Royal Caribbean.
5.0	Sail Date: Oct 28, 2018 /	We had a wonderful time! Boardwalk balcony, clean room...great view. Perfect vacation.
4.6	Sail Date: Oct 28, 2018 /	We had an amazing time it's the most I've been relaxed in a long time.
4.3	Sail Date: Oct 28, 2018 /	Best ever waitstaff in the main dining room. They went above and beyond to take care of any wishes we had. As for the rest of the MDR experience...  not so great.  Very loud people, people coming to dinner 30-45 minutes late and very inappropriately dressed made the experience less than great.  There were guests dressed just as they came off the basketball court. Men in tanks with hairy armpits is a disgusting sight at dinner.  I know this is not a popular view, but it is mine. Dress casual should be the least dressed allowed in any white linen restaurant. The smaller limited menu was a bit disappointing as well.  We did not have a chance to see Cats, but all other shows were excellent.  Overall a very nice cruise.
3.0	Sail Date: Oct 28, 2018 /	"Royal Carribean is no longer something special...  The entetainment was very disappointing with the exception of the one Juggling act.  My  adult children were bored much of the time.  It seems like they have entertainment for the old folks and young folks but not in between unless you drink... I imagine the entertainment is much netter when you are drunk. But since none of us do that, it left us a little disappointed.  The food was disappointing too... unles you pay for the specialty restaurants.  So  it is nice to have more affordable cruises... but the cruising magic is gone. The staff tries their best to make you feel special... but they obviously have less to work with and its obvious they are cutting corners to get the price down.

Everyone in our Family agreed it was a good vacation but not great.  I feel like the magic has gone out of cruising, with so many corners being cut.  My family said that they would prefer many other vacations over this one."
5.0	Sail Date: Oct 21, 2018 /	"This was our 1st cruise and it did not disappoint! Every member of staff was very helpful and pleasant. I was unsure if the kids would be happy on a ship, and I think they enjoyed it more than us!! The kids club was fantastic. 
We used MDR 6 nights out of 7, and had some of the best food. My husband has a peanut allergy and they went above and beyond to make sure he was well catered for.

All in all had a fab time.. and next cruise is booked!!!"
5.0	Sail Date: Oct 21, 2018 /	First time on this ship, she was big and beautiful. Plenty of entertainment and never got bored, always something to do! We had a great dining experience at Giovanni's Table.
2.9	Sail Date: Oct 21, 2018 /	Had I paid full price, I would now be pissed off!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
4.8	Sail Date: Oct 21, 2018 /	This my was our first cruise and the overall experience was very nice. The Lady O was beautiful and my favorite spots were Central Park (at night)  and the Solarium. There were lots of good shows to see, Frozen in Time was a good one. It felt good to be catered to and waited on for an entire week. We will definitely be cruising again soon.
4.0	Sail Date: Oct 21, 2018 /	"We just got off this ship. This was our second cruise. Our first being on a much smaller ship. We also took the kids and grandma with us on this cruise. It was a great experience. 

Staterooms:
Our staterooms 11440 and 11443 were both interior rooms. They were better than I expected. The stateroom attendant took care of making the sofa bed every evening and putting it away every morning. This definitely helped the room feel bigger. The sofa bed and the regular bed were both comfortable. There was a mini fridge in the room as well and lots of little cubby holes and shelves for storage. A few things I had read prior to going that also really helped us stay organized in the room was taking an over the door shoe organizer. We were able to put little items in the pockets and keep the desk clear of clutter. We also took a pop up laundry basket to collect dirty clothes in through the week. The shower had really good water pressure and the water stayed hot for three back to back showers every day so no one was left with out hot water. Lol! 

Dining:

Main dining was good. The service was good. They made special efforts to do things like cut up my son’s steak for him so I could go ahead and eat. They brought extra chocolate chip cookies to the table every night so the kids could take them back to the room. They brought my youngest Shirley temples to drink when he got tired of the same old lemonade or water. 

Windjammer was great. So many choices. The kids ate their weight in bacon and waffles every morning. The burgers and hotdogs were our favorite. The desserts were yummy!!

Sorentos pizza was a great choice for a change of pace. 

Kids activities:  

I was a little disappointed in the kids areas. I will say this is only because of the ages of my kids being 7, 10 and 12. They all would have been in separate groups. They did not like the idea of being separated and being with people they didn’t know.  the activities listed didn’t really appeal to them and so they didn’t attend any of the sessions. I also think 12 is kind of young to be in the teens groups. It might be good if they had a tweens group. I didn’t really like the idea of my daughter hanging out with older kids and no one checking her in or out. Maybe if we had traveled with a group and she could have been with others we knew it would have been more acceptable. 

We were cruising the week before Halloween and I didn’t see any Halloween activities planned. We had brought costumes just in case but nope. 

I also wish they would have a swimming area dedicated to older kids. There is a kind of splash pad play area and a shallow pool for smaller kids. However, my kids want to swim in a deep pool which often was full of adults who would congregate and drink alcohol. I have no problem with that but the kids couldn’t really splash around and swim without bumping into others or splashing adults who got annoyed by it. 

As far as activities, the ice skating sessions were fun but too short. The miniature golf was fun and and the sports court was nice. My middle son wanted to zip line but there is a 75 lb weight minimum. He was 70lbs. He tried his hardest to gain that last five by the end of the week. It just didn’t happen. The flowrider looked fun but we didn’t get that adventurous. The Dreamworks parade was awesome. Make sure to get a spot early and the best spot are the seats in front of sorentos pizza. 

Shows: 

Cats: ughhh. The talent was great. The show was terrible. We left at intermission. I just don’t get it. I feel like I was missing something. The older lady next to me seemed to really be enjoying it. 

Frozen in time: awesome show. Especially the guest sand animation artist. I could watch that all day. 

Come Fly with Me: this is a brand new show. We got to see the opening night. Lots of acrobatics. Very cool and entertaining

Oasis of Dreams: fabulous and fun diving water show. My kids sat first row front and center and were soaking wet at the end. Loved every minute of it. 

Headliner: wished we would have gone but we decided to skip it

Comedy shows: we skipped these too. 

Arcade: waste of money. Prizes were horrible and the games were expensive. 

Casino: typical slots. You win some and you lose more but fun every time

Cruise Director: this guy was awful. Our other cruise the cruise director was like the fun party guy. The cruise director on this one had a very dry sense of humor and I didn’t really see much of the party atmosphere like on the Majesty of the Seas. 

Ports:

Labadee: so beautiful. Wonderful beach day. The shopping is hard because they are very pushy. Made me feel like I couldn’t just look around. I would have bought more if they didn’t try so hard. 

Jamaica: great shopping right at the port. We did the dolphin cove dolphin encounter.  It was great but a one hour shuttle ride each way which didn’t leave a lot of time to enjoy this place. The kids were disappointed that we ran out of time before doing everything. They offered kayaks, snorkeling, pet sting rays, swimming, water slide, etc. the dolphin encounter was great and Really fun!! They also make you buy their photos and not take your own. They are $$. I think it was $240 for the disc with 90 photos of my 5 family members but it would have been $35 for just one photo printed. Those are the only options. No smaller packages. 

Cozumel: my favorite. Great shopping at the port. We did the Playa Mia beach resort day. This place was awesome for families. Tons to do there. Kayak, paddle boats, pools, water slides, snorkeling, trampoline inflatable obstacle course. It is a Short shuttle ride from the port. Awesome!!!

crowds: There were a ton of people on this boat. Honestly you felt it the most on the first day when everyone arrived and was getting settled. After that it was fine. The ports were well organized for getting on and off the boat. We did self disembarking on the final day and we were out the door and through customs on the shuttle to the airport all within 20-30 minutes before 8:00am. 

Happy cruising. I hope this review helps other getting ready to go on the Oasis."

4.4	Sail Date: Oct 14, 2018 /	Weather could have been better overall still a nice cruise
4.3	Sail Date: Oct 14, 2018 /	"First time traveling during Halloween which was fabulous.  Royal Caribben had planned events, and it was a great experience.  Having a person who did face painting on board was excellent.  My granddaughter had her face painted often ""Kelly"" was talented."
5.0	Sail Date: Oct 14, 2018 /	We had an amazing time on this ship. Our room attendant and servers were the best. All of the staff were knowledgeable of the ship and activities.  A+
5.0	Sail Date: Oct 14, 2018 /	Overall  was great!! I really enjoyed  meeting new people. There were something  to do on every deck. Just the fun and excitement  and the amazing  view of the water. Snd the beaches.  The staff  and the amazing  food. Overall  everything was just great!! An unforgettable moment of my life.  I will treasure  every moment  and will never forget  the experience. Thanking God for a safe journey  of my vacation.  God bless  oasis  of the sea. For good hospitality.
5.0	Sail Date: Oct 14, 2018 /	My wonderful wife and I sailed Oasis 10/15/17. We have always sailed on RC and up to now Freedom was our favorite ship. Now I would have to say Oasis is our favorite. The only time we felt crowded was when we first got on the ship and headed to the Windjammer. I think everyone else had the same idea. Besides that, the food and service all over the ship was outstanding. If you hang out at the pools, say hi to Dezley. He is a wonderful young man delivering drinks to the pool area. We had such a great time, we have booked our cruise on Oasis next year.
4.9	Sail Date: Oct 07, 2018 /	"We had a fantastic time and can't wait to do it again!!  This was our first 'mega ship' experience, there were things that we loved and things we didn't love so much but overall it was wonderful and are already trying to decide what to do next..for me anyway, planning is almost as much fun as the actual trip..anyone else agree??  I saw this on my Vacation App today, and it's so true!!  ""A vacation is like love: anticipated with pleasure, experienced with discomfort, and remembered with nostalgia.""  Happy Cruising Everyone!!"
2.7	Sail Date: Oct 07, 2018 /	Food wasn't as good as I had hoped, definitely not enough to do on a ship that size. Broadway show cats was not good at all . Fountain drinks were not good at all. I was just disappointed with the whole trip
4.0	Sail Date: Oct 07, 2018 /	Love Royal. Having to book the shows is a bummer. I’m the type to not make any plans on a vacation just take each day. The ship is amazing as they all are. The staff is always wonderful. I do wish they had the Abyss slide like they have on their other Oasis class ships.
5.0	Sail Date: Oct 07, 2018 /	Second time on the Oasis and she never disappoints! This time we did the 3 night dining package, We ate at hibachi, 150 Central Park & chops. (Windjammer and main dining room other nights) service was wonderful and the food was delicious! The casino bar staff was outstanding! Especially Rupesh! Enertainment was great. you ever get the chance to go on the Oasis, do it!!
4.0	Sail Date: Oct 07, 2018 /	"Positives: plenty of bar staff and more than enough staff running drink for shows and at the pool. Heidi and Gener at On Air were lovely. Leo at Dazzles was so much fun. Paul at the pool deck bar took care of my kids. AJ at Schooner was great too. Don't believe for a second that food quality in the mdr has taken a dive. We had several different fish of the day, ahi, swordfish, cod and salmon. I had shrimp every night with escargot as well. My kids enjoyed pasta dishes, coconut shrimp, tiger shrimp and strip steak multiple times. We had lamb, duck and pork shank. Dessert was great too. Jasonn the head waiter, Clapston our waiter and Peter the assistant waiter were as pleasant and hard working as any I've had in 8 cruises. Our stateroom attendant Earl was a gem! He took care of us like no other. We were at capacity and there were always chairs around the pool or in the solarium. Wind jammer buffet was great along with cafe promenade and sorrentos. My family of 4 never had an issue with the coke freestyle machines. Enjoyed the shows, trivia, and all entertainment tremendously.

Negatives: A huge amount of overweight folks in motorized chairs. I'm not talking disabled, I'm talking overweight. If this trend continues, they must go to a doc note to have these. I was run into and had to make way for these every day! The elevators were the worst I can ever remember. It was normal to wait over 5 minutes and stop at every single floor. For the first time, I didn't feel there were enough activities for my early teen kids at night in the teen area. A ton of rude people on the ship. An older man shoved me out of a chair at the side pool deck bar...can't make this stuff up. He said...you are in my chair as he shoved. Glad I took the high road, but if I asked for the camera to be viewed, he would have been kicked off immediately at the next port. My son was shoved out of the elevator for...not moving fast enough. Casino was more smoky than I ever remember. The ship absolutely felt crowded at times...lines for breakfast in the mdr and at the buffet in the mdr. Waited 30 minutes on Tuesday to get in. The promenade is impassable after a parade or during shopping. Aqua shows were canceled, but made up...times conflicted so we missed. Aqua show seems like a good idea, but maybe not on a cruise ship lol. One thing I noticed in multiple areas was rude people being taken care of over really nice people and I truly think it's so a bad review isn't left. 

This was my 2nd time on Oasis and I love her. It's what you make it, always is. Now though I have no desire for the bigger ships. I love Freedom class size and will stick with mid size to smaller ships. Hope the review seems honest, because it is. Happy cruising everyone!"
5.0	Sail Date: Oct 07, 2018 /	"This was our second sailing on Oasis and it does not disappoint. Everything was so easy. Embarkation took about 20 minutes from the time we dropped off our luggage to the time we got on the ship. Debarkation was even easier. We left our room at 8:05. We were group 10. We were at our car in the garage by 8:50. 

We saw 2 comedy shows and the love and marriage game show. They were entertaining. 

The food and service was good. Central Park was really relaxing and had good options at park cafe. Solarium Bistro was great for breakfast, it was never crowded. The main dining room was good. Lobster night was our favorite! 

The back of the ship on deck 5 has the best views, day and night. It’s so relaxing. 

We purchased he couples thermal suite for the week. That was a first and we will definitely do it again."
3.5	Sail Date: Oct 07, 2018 /	My handicapped daughter was unable to access the balcony because of the way the door frame was configurator .
5.0	Sail Date: Oct 07, 2018 /	Great experience! Will be doing this trip again! Went with my husband and 4 other friends. Lots of different things to do and see!
1.0	Sail Date: Oct 07, 2018 /	I usually cruise with Carnival, so this was my first Royal Cruise. We did a big family reunion so prior to the cruise we called 3 times to verify and confirm we were all linked together. When we arrived we were not linked together which is not ideal for dining and shows. Royal did not seem to care or interested in resolving the situation. After a hour and a half of meeting with manager to manager the only thing they ended up fixing was dinner dining and they were not nice to us. A lot of the free food was not very good and closed early. Water was not easily accessible. The AC in our room did not work well and the staff did not try to fix. Overall it was a very bad experience and I will stay a loyal cruiser to Carnival.
3.4	Sail Date: Sep 30, 2018 /	It was a special cruise for a  Birthday,an Anniversary I had gotten a Balcony found room to be a little tight. LCD TV was over Make up vanity when in bed you would get creak in your neck. The beds  were BAD they had valleys even after a flip. My room had a couch but very confining.Room service for cookies and milk $7.95 charge. Liquor start 7.95 goes up every day. Windjammer food better than dining rm
4.2	Sail Date: Sep 30, 2018 /	"I was good, my son an me have fun, I love cuises, i will do more.

Carlos"
4.6	Sail Date: Sep 30, 2018 /	Overall very happy with the cruise the only thing I don't like is having to book my shows would like to just show up.  I do understand it is a must with this many passengers but that is the only down fall.  Large ship is great it never felt crowded, drinks were easy to get staff was friendly.
4.2	Sail Date: Sep 30, 2018 /	Great Cruise, great ship, great crew. I wouldn't hesitate to book Oasis of the Sea again.
4.0	Sail Date: Sep 30, 2018 /	"I was dissapointed in the staff overall which makes a hugedifference. They really set the tone.

I'm not a big shopper so the focus on shopping wasn't for me. I would rather have more fun, scheduled activities. I had way more fun on Carnival and the staff was way more attentive and friendly. 

I do like that it never really felt crowded (except the buffet). There were always open chairsaround the pool. The food was good. Awesome stuff for the kids to do. Kids club, parties on the Boardwalk, specific areas for 12-17 years olds, and activities/get togethers for them. I loved being able to use the kids club so that my husband and I could have time to ourlselves."
4.7	Sail Date: Sep 30, 2018 /	"We thoroughly enjoyed our cruise. The ship is beautiful and impeccably maintained.  The crew do everything possible to assure a wonderful vacation for the passengers.  There is plenty of activities onboard and the shows are fabulous. We found the food to be very good everywhere but the Windjammer.
In short, I hope I am able to cruise again very soon. Excellent value for the cost."
5.0	Sail Date: Sep 30, 2018 /	Had a awesome time and would do it again. The only thing is they lost my package that I brought from  Cozumel Mexico
5.0	Sail Date: Sep 30, 2018 /	Good food great ship everything was great except the elevators we're always busy but had a fun time would love to do it again had a balcony and enjoyed the view every morning
4.4	Sail Date: Sep 30, 2018 /	We love the size of this ship and we are looking forward to sailing on Harmony next year.
5.0	Sail Date: Sep 30, 2018 /	our dinning room waiter and asst. waiter was excellent. made sure we had all we needed
5.0	Sail Date: Sep 30, 2018 /	This was our first cruise and it has been phenomenal. We are currently on day 5 and so sad that it will be coming to an end. Our waiters Alberto and Wessim at the American icon grill have been the best! So personable and great with my kids. Our stateroom attendant Alfaro has been so attentive. He turns down our room right after we leave for dinner and always makes sure everything is neat and tidy. The Pullman bed in the cabin is great since we have 3 kids. The attendant pulls it down at night and puts it up in the morning. The pools are great. They are crowded on sea days but what do you expect when it is 92 degrees and you have a ship this large full of people. So sad that Oasis is moving to the Mediterranean. Could not imagine sailing in anything other than an oasis class ship now that we have been spoiled .
5.0	Sail Date: Sep 30, 2018 /	This ship is beautiful. So many activities to chose from.  Don’t forget to make your reservations for shows because they fill up fast and with so many people on board unless you reserve ahead you may miss the shows. I have cruised on this ship 3 times and I’m sure I’ll be on board again soon.
3.2	Sail Date: Sep 23, 2018 /	"Let me begin this review by stating that I am not a bitter person.  An opinionated jerk with a bad attitude, maybe, but I’m not bitter.
Oasis of the Seas
The ship itself is extraordinary.  It is HUGE, but it is manageable.  Sadly, we left the ship without exploring all there is to see, but we were well occupied while there.  With the exception of a couple of elevator buttons that did not work, the ship is well maintained and in tip-top condition.  
All of the crew that we met and dealt with were outstanding.  No issues there at all.
However, the overall experience was disappointing, and I do not think that it is due to having set our expectations too high.  This was an expensive vacation, and I think Royal Caribbean made little effort to make this the cruise experience it should be.  Let’s start with lack of information.  The ONLY time we heard an announcement inside our stateroom was the safety drill instructions just after getting onboard.  There was NEVER another announcement that we could hear from inside the room or while outside on the balcony.  And, those that we DID hear while roaming the ship, were unintelligible due to a combination of choppy English and a less than up to par public address system.  All elevator lobbies have an interactive display of current ship information and an interactive “you are here” that will guide you to where you need to go.  Why can’t this also display current / recent announcements?  Or, better yet, why isn’t the Royal Caribbean phone app used for displaying announcements in a text format?  Honestly, I was wondering if being informed was an extra charge?  Everywhere we turned, it seemed like there was something that “costs extra”, so was / is there also a charge for information while onboard?  It seemed we were constantly running across something that having instructions for would have been nice.  And please don’t tell me it was the onboard television network that had what we needed.  For disembarking, we were instructed to tune into channel 37.  When you get there, you get the video with the instructions and the cruise director is holding a different sheet of paper and telling us we were watching channel 41.  So even this was out of date.  It wasn’t until after we had waited in line on deck 5 to be seated for dinner that we were told “My Time” dining was on deck 3.  Why isn’t something like that clearly noted somewhere?
And since we’ve jumped to that subject, we told the sales rep with RC that we wanted reserved seating at a group table each night.  That didn’t happen.  Each night we were seated at a different 2-person table, different area of the main dining room…and, of course, with a different wait staff each night.  So much for getting to know someone.  And…we packed extra clothes because RC makes a big to-do about the dress code for the main dining room.  No t-shirts, no shorts, no flip flops.  Why wasn’t this enforced?  Every night, including formal nights, there was a steady stream of classless guys in shorts, t-shirts and flip flops.  RC seriously drops the ball by not enforcing the dress code.  Why not hang a “Welcome to Carnival” sign at the entrance?  
As for the food in the main dining room, it is good.  Not great, but good.  It is an insult to be handed a menu with the limited choices and then at the bottom see “other options” that we can pay extra for.  How deep is RC into the pockets of those specialty restaurants paying rent for space on that ship?  It’s bad enough that half of the “Cruise Compass” is dedicated to pushing you toward eating at the high-priced venues, but to also have it shoved down your throat while eating in the main dining room?  Show some class Royal Caribbean.
Another totally classless act by RC is the “private” island of Labadee.  So, this area is “owned” by Royal Caribbean and only Royal Caribbean vessels can dock there?  And Royal Caribbean includes this as a stop on the cruise because it is such a special place and they want everyone to enjoy it…as long as you pay extra to do it.  Not one “public” beach for passengers to go to and enjoy the sand and surf???  They ALL have a price tag.  I don’t know how far you have to walk there to find a simple souvenir shop, but after walking as far as the coconut rum vendors in front of the “No Swimming” posted beach area, I was not willing to walk any farther.  I turned around and went back to the ship.  I guess my refrigerator will survive without a Labadee magnet.
And you may notice I did not mention my wife as having gone onto Labadee with me.  She had spent that morning seeing the doctor because of a sinus infection brought on by allergic reactions to something onboard combined with a reaction to the cigarette smoke ever present in the non-smoking side of the casino.  The smell of the smoke hits you as soon as you exit the elevators.  Even walking around from the port side of Studio B, it hits you when you enter the casino area.  That is just wrong.  If it can’t be filtered out through air exchangers, it needs to be banned.  And I guess there is no point in mentioning those who smoked on the non-smoking side.  Again, why doesn’t RC enforce the rules?  Are they that afraid of offending someone by holding them to a standard?
And finally (you probably thought I would never get here), kids with children who are not mature enough to be parents.  One reason we opted for the late September sailing was our thinking that children would be in school.  And based on the number of “packs” of pre-teen children that were running loose on board without supervision, It seems there were a lot of schools not in session.  If you have unruly children and you don’t have the backbone to discipline them or keep them in line, go to Disney World or Universal.  If you are going to sit in the main dining room and watch your children run around being disruptive, YOU are the problem, not them.  Grow up and show some responsibility for yourself and your children, and at the very least, show some respect for the people around you.
And before you think we had a miserable time, we didn’t.  We met several really nice couples and made some friendships that I expect will be long lasting.  We met a couple at the hotel before sailing and we palled around with them all week, having a great time.  We saw the “Cats” production and it was a fantastic show (long, but really good) and also the ABBA tribute band, whose show was really well produced.  We loved the ADULT ONLY solarium area.  It would be nice if the pool there were bigger, but we had fun.
And those Mimosa Happy Hours…Oh, Baby!  The bar staff knew my name and only had to ask “How many?”.  Those were awesome.  And my wife left the casino with more money than she took in with her, so another big positive!
This was just our second cruise in the twenty-four years we’ve been together, so we’re obviously not seasoned enough to know all the little secrets to making the experience better.  But, we thought with it being Royal Caribbean, we wouldn’t have to be travel experts.  We’ll know better the next time.  Whether or not we will use RC again is up for debate."
5.0	Sail Date: Sep 23, 2018 /	Had a great time on our cruise. Food, activities,  and time relaxing was great.
3.8	Sail Date: Sep 23, 2018 /	No good entertainment to watch at night, Cats was the worst show ever seen at sea. Never see Aqua show called off four different times.Ice skating show was fantastic, comedians were great but venue was size of large closet. Come fly with me the show was three quarters great the other quarter just killed time, terrible. Food was fantastic, service was not that great in some areas. A lot of area of ship just served high price extras. Really small venues with below average talent. Glad I did large ship, impressed with Oasis size but lacked the feel of a cruise ship , more like a theme park feel. Hurry up and wait is what it was about.
4.1	Sail Date: Sep 23, 2018 /	Lots of good things about this ship and cruise. Crew is great; friendly and helpful. Entertainment is fabulous-don't miss any shows. Food was just ok and variety in dining rooms and Windjammer is limited IMHO. Biggest criticisms: RCCL App is useless - don't bother with it. Smoking sections should be at back of ship where you don't have to walk through them to get somewhere else. Really need an outdoor Adult Only pool - Solarium pool doesn't count; it's not really a pool at all.
4.0	Sail Date: Sep 23, 2018 /	You've got to kidding me! Went to see a show ( Come Fly With Me) and they were charging $2.50 cents for a box of pop corn. In comparison, other Ships bring you a bag of pop corn and even a blanket if you happen to need it. Others around us were commenting about the charge as well. It's not about $2.50 is going to bankrupt anyone it's more about in comparison with other ships I've traveled on. If the money was going to a worthy cause I would not write this.
4.8	Sail Date: Sep 23, 2018 /	All shows were great except cats. Staff was friendly and helpful.  The food was yummy.  Ports were wonderful!  Especialy liked Puerto Rico.
4.9	Sail Date: Sep 23, 2018 /	"We were pampered to the enth degree!
Everyone was more than helpful and pleasant.
Except for Cats the entertainment everywhere was exceptional.
The food and servers were amazing.
We met so many wonderful people.
The ports of call were breathtaking.
We already booked our next cruise."
3.4	Sail Date: Sep 23, 2018 /	"Oasis of the Seas is a big ship, to big for me. i would rather go on a smaller ship.
Half of there staff should go back for retraining.
My worst experience was Haiti I would never return there
All in all I would rate the cruise going 1--10 a 4."
5.0	Sail Date: Sep 23, 2018 /	Great way to spend a vacation! Had never been to some of these islands. May need to go back and see more.
4.9	Sail Date: Sep 23, 2018 /	My first cruise and I'm hooked!!!!!! Already looking at my next.
3.3	Sail Date: Sep 23, 2018 /	"Day 1) Cut arm on trim outside elevator, went to medical station, had it cleaned/bandaged.
Trim that cut arm was not repaired for 3 days and was, only after repleted request. Very dangerous, especially if small child was to bump. (Head level to a 4-3 yr old)
Day 5) Looked like infection and went to medical station on day 6 no one there. Went to guest services, while in line a roaming Cruise line employee  called medic and handed me the cell phone. Medic told me that there was nothing she could do for me until next day.
Went to counter person to file complaint about the wait, only then would medic make time to look at my arm
Went to medical station once again. Medic was very rude but, she did tend to my arm. Have photos of Dangerous trIm as well as my arm less a chunk of meat. Was unable to do excursions involving salt water. It just wasn’t the trip I expected it to be."
1.6	Sail Date: Sep 23, 2018 /	"If you speak to Land staff of RCC get it documented and if possible copy sent to you.  Write down name of Rep, job title and time of call as it will be thrown back at you later on.  I called  Sept 5th to discuss my refund of soda package I bought for hubby and was told refund would be on my card.   Today is Oct 9th and still no refund.  Got the email confirming the refund but nothing in acct yet.  Said the refund could also be a ship credit so asked if that had possibly happened and was told no so have no idea where my money went.   Staff on ship said nothing to do with them and when they called they said land staff said it was refunded Sept 6th well before sailing so won't have gone on shipboard credit but can't give me info on what acct number they refunded so someone got $148 but not me!   I also discussed my buying the alcohol drink package for myself as hubby is allergic to alcohol and was told I could purchase it once onboard and had to have hubby present to confirm his allergy.  They understood that not every passenger drank or could due to medical or was a recovering addict etc so of course it was available to purchase just one package in person.   I was told it would be at 30% discounted price as long as I purchased at Guest Services and then first day only!!  Got on board and was called a liar by Gibson the on board Guest Services staff member.  Said nothing was documented in my file so obviously I did not speak to any one of RCC staff.   Onboard and land staff have different rules so what I book on shore is not always what I get once onboard unless it is documented in my file by the rep I talk to.   When I got upset at being called a liar he made a call and was told if I had a medical waiver from hubby's doctor I could have it at 10% discount and that was a favor to me for being top tier passenger.  Would not give me the name of person he spoke to or let me speak to them myself.   I refused to accept less than what I had been told I would get if I waited to purchase in person, so left.  At 4 pm on 4th day of cruise I got called to Guest Services to be offered the package at 30% off but we had to pay for 4 full days or nothing.   If we hadn't been comped through travel agent and Top Tier Crown & Anchor Society free meals at Chops, Giovannis, Sabors, and Johnny Rockets would have been a miserable week.  Timing for evening shows made eating in Dining room impossible as they were slow.  So ate at specialty restaurants or Windjammer.  In the Windjammer the food was either raw (eggs at breakfast were runny and raw everyday including the premade omelets were only cooked on one side and folded over the raw tops, chicken and fish at lunch raw when cut open to eat),  waffles soggy, pancakes rubbery, soups were tepid and just not the all around variety we came to expect in old standbys like crusty rolls.  On 3rd day of cruise Head of Windjammer stopped by our table as he was talking to passengers about any concerns so I told him my issues listed here.  I asked if the eggs served were real as real eggs shouldn't be served raw and these were soupy.  He said they were aware of the issue and it was being addressed.  Apparently for next cruise as nothing changed all week.  No longer serve plain croissants at breakfast, a waitress would go down to dining room and get them for me last 3 days after everyone finally admitted they weren't available upstairs anymore.  Can't believe I am only one who likes them with breakfast.   I was told for first few days to just wait they would be bringing more out or when we waited and none came, was told ""sorry they must have run out, come back earlier tomorrow and try to get them then."" Couldn't wait as we were run out of the dining room it was so crowded they were announcing you were to eat and leave asap.  Miss having someone offering you coffee or tea when you are eating, etc.  Only happened twice all week.  I asked for lemon for my water at the drink station where they were filling the glasses of water, lemonade juices, etc and was told to go find it myself at the bar.  When I asked where that was he said he didn't know and walked off.  He said only bar staff is allowed to handle sharp knives so that is where the fruits were sliced.  I asked if perhaps he could cut slices when not making drinks and  some of the staff put them around with the water etc.  He said no they no longer offer lemon or lime for non bar drinks.  Then didn't have staff to train them in knife safety so they couldn't allow that to happen as it wasn't in their job description and no longer in their policy he said.  MADE NO SENSE as there was plenty of times I saw the bartender standing around talking to other staff he could have sliced a lemon or two and talk at same time.   It is the little things that make cruising special and fun but RCC no longer offers them or charges for it!    Yes, I could have eaten Pizza or sandwiches but friends we were with said they didn't want to rely on foods we can buy everyday @ home so only ate at Johnny Rockets once as it was free.   Good thing about this cruise I came home having lost weight not gained it!  Gained 2 notches on my belt!"
4.5	Sail Date: Sep 23, 2018 /	Wonderful time and great service! Breakfast in the main dining room was wonderful! Dinner service was amazing. Labadee was our favorite spot!
4.1	Sail Date: Sep 23, 2018 /	Once I got over my funk about not being in the right room that I had invisioned for months and knowing this was it for 7 days it ended up being a fabulous time. Can’t wait to go again but this time I’ll try ocean View
5.0	Sail Date: Sep 23, 2018 /	"Had an awesome time on board the Oasis of the Seas Eastern Caribbean Cruise. We just got back today. 
Ship is huge and has lots to do to stay busy. We loved everything except “Cats” show. 
Found that we liked eating breakfast in the dining room at the buffet best, lunch we ate at the Wind Jammer a few times. I preferred Sorrentos pizza, Pronenade Cafe or Cafe in Central Park. Dinner we loved eating at the dining room with very attentive waiters making sure we had a wonderful meal."
5.0	Sail Date: Sep 23, 2018 /	Doesn’t get much better than this! Well kept, ship shape! She is in great condition. The carpets are barely showing their age and still look great. It’s a fun ship with tons of things to do. Food is good and never had any complaints about it. Shows are pretty good, casts are broadway levels! Park cafe roast beef sandwiches will have you back for more !! Great Vacation Ship.
4.3	Sail Date: Sep 16, 2018 /	The cruise is very nice.  My husband and I just discovered that we are not cruisers.  The food in the dining room was equivalent to maybe an Appleby’s.  However the service in the dining room was excellent.  Central Park was wonderful.  Loved the music there in the evenings.   Enjoyed the roast beef sandwiches in the Park Cafe.  Loved the chocolate mousse in the Promenade.   Cafe.  The shows were excellent although I would never go to an adult comedy show again.  Didn’t care for Cats.  “Come Fly With Me.” Was cancelled due to an equipment malfunction.  There was enough to do without complaining about that.  Our deck and probably others was without water for several hours.  I was worried about that because of the possibility of illness.  Didn’t care for Nassau.  Got talked into a horse and buggy ride which was a rip-off. St. Thomas and St. Maarten were very nice.  We ate lunch and rented beach umbrellas at Bikini Beach.  That was part of our tour.  We took overview tours of both of the islands.  All I can say is “been there done that.”  We have cruised the Hawaiian Islands twice with Norwegian.  We plan on cruising Alaska this summer.  I think that will be it for us.  Also cruised the western Caribbean.
5.0	Sail Date: Sep 16, 2018 /	First time cruise. Brilliant staff, entertainment and food. All round brilliant.
5.0	Sail Date: Sep 16, 2018 /	I have been to the on air bar quite a few times and the bartenders are amazing especially Heidi she remembered who I was and the drink that I like, she also provides water after I finish my drink.
3.5	Sail Date: Sep 16, 2018 /	Weather was nice and cruise was smooth. The ship was just older and run down. We made the mistake of cruising on a much older ship on this cruise, our 2nd cruise,  and my husband was so disappointed that he’s not planning to cruise again. So sad because we loved our 1st cruise.
5.0	Sail Date: Sep 16, 2018 /	Excellent cruise.  Suite is definitely the way to go.
4.3	Sail Date: Sep 16, 2018 /	Very relaxing cruise. No need to ever leave the ship!
3.8	Sail Date: Sep 16, 2018 /	It was a good time. There was an incident in Giovanis with some patrons. It took the staff way to long for the staff to handle the situation. It disturbed most of our dinner. A hot tub caught fire and a stage was broke. Maybe time for some updates.
5.0	Sail Date: Sep 16, 2018 /	Food and service was excellent. You will have to cruise on this ship for 2 months to experience all it has to offer
5.0	Sail Date: Sep 16, 2018 /	This was our first cruise with our family. This has been the BEST vacation we have been on and looking forward to another.... just have to decide where next lol. The staff on the cruise was very helpful, nice and never rude.
4.8	Sail Date: Sep 16, 2018 /	Our first cruise, given as a gift by our daughter to celebrate our 50th anniversary.  Loved it and talking of plans to cruise again.  So may highlights, I'll need to write them down so I can remember them all.  The night the headliner show recognized those celebrating their 50th or more anniversaries was very special, called up and were able to dance.  Then when at Dazzles before we left hubby again surprised me and we danced.  The food, the staff, talking with folks from other countries.  We have to go again, we could not do it all.  Oh and sitting on our balcony and watching the ocean and sometimes land go by.  Coming into and leaving Ports of Call.  Unplugging from social media was relaxing also.  Loved it all.
5.0	Sail Date: Sep 16, 2018 /	Wonderful cruise.  We met interesting people from Australia and Ireland.  Made long lasting friendships.  Beautiful ship, I recommend the All Access tour of the ship to appreciate it.
5.0	Sail Date: Sep 16, 2018 /	"I can't explain how amazing this vacation is.  I'm even emotional talking about it, everything is perfect!!!
We did this cruise last year for September break as well.  It was so perfect that we decided to do it again.  I'm so glad that we did because it was PERFECT again!
We had Royen as our waiter and Roumel as our assistant waiter.  Keisha was our head waiter.  I can't even describe to you how absolutely fantastic they are.  We have 3 young children.  2 are identical twins, my mom can't tell them apart.  All 3 of them could, because they take the time to get to know our family and generally care. They knew our likes and dislikes.  They knew us.  It was so very amazing to be pampered in this way.  The 3 of them are truly  FANTASTIC people.  
Keion was our stateroom attendant.  He was also fabulous.  He was so kind.  Our room was perfect every time we walked into it.  My kids LOVED the animals.  You could tell that he goes above and beyond in his job. 

Overall, if I was going to describe this vacation in one word it would be PERFECT.  With 3 kids it is very hard to go on a relaxing vacation.  There is a ton to do.  This is the best vacation, 2 years in a row, that we have been on. We will continue to travel with you guys. It is wonderful."
4.0	Sail Date: Sep 09, 2018 /	Really enjoyed our week on the Oasis of the seas. Was worried about being such a big ship if we would feel like it was to crowded this was not a problem. Majority of the staff was great. Food was ok. Feel as if the main dining room  could have had better food. Bars were awesome.  Would definitely go on this ship again.
5.0	Sail Date: Sep 09, 2018 /	The Oasis class never disappoints. Service and people are great! The Boardwalk cabins are a treat, but choose a cabin closest to the rock climbing wall so you get a nice view of the ocean too. The Central Park cabins are nice but the air can get hot in that area during the day with little circulation. Looking forward to our next cruise.
4.8	Sail Date: Sep 09, 2018 /	Great cruise, I would definitely do this cruise again.
5.0	Sail Date: Sep 09, 2018 /	Cruise was great. It was our cousin trip with 3 of my cousins.
5.0	Sail Date: Sep 09, 2018 /	"Had a great time, great experience overall. Special shout out to my stateroom attendant ""Tut"" he made sure all our needs were met. Another special shout out to our main dining room servers Brian, Julian, Ernesto and Remy, they went above and beyond to make sure our party of 40 was well taken care of."
4.6	Sail Date: Sep 09, 2018 /	Beautiful ship, excellent food and shows. Service great. No real complaints. Would book again but a different itinerary.
4.4	Sail Date: Sep 09, 2018 /	"Being my first cruise, I read everything online I could.  Did I overpack?  YES, but that's me on any trip.  We had excellent wait staff from the main dining room (You are awesome Kenroy & Herpaul!)  to our room attendant (Takes great care of you - thanks, Alson).  The food was excellent in the main dining room and at the Chop House.  Windjammer was good also with lots of choices but some of the desserts were bland.  The staff was very friendly and accomodating in the Windjammer.   Entertainment was top knotch.  Ended up watching CATS twice!  Before you watch it, read a summary of the Cats story so it will make more sense.  Very talented dancers and singers.  ""Come Fly With Me"" was also very good.  Amazing talent there.  We also enjoyed Frozen in Time (started off a little slow but boy does it get better!).  Loved the oceanview balcony room - this is a must for future cruises for us."
5.0	Sail Date: Sep 09, 2018 /	We had such a great time on the Oasis for our first cruise! We loved it so much that we booked another while we were on board! The ship was very clean and well taken care of. The layout is fantastic, the neighbor hood concept makes it feel like there’s nowhere near 7000 people on board.
4.8	Sail Date: Sep 09, 2018 /	This was the best cruise I have been on out of the 6 I have done! Cruise.com made the embarkation a breeze and I will definitely use the service again!! Thanks for a great trip..
4.0	Sail Date: Sep 09, 2018 /	"First time on a ship this large. There are certain times you can tell just how many people are on board and other times you forget how large it really is. The food in the main dining room was above average and the service exceptional. The entertainment was wonderful excluding the ""headliner"" show. We had Lady Luck which was basically 4 Caucasian women trying to out-sing each other. It gave me a headache 2 songs in. There was a band Enclave that played in Boleros most nights. They were excellent musicians and vocalists. The ice show, aqua show, and Come Fly with Me show were well produced and entertaining. We had funny comedians Dan Gabriel and Joe Yannety. The pizza at Sorrento's was always fresh. Some of the bartenders weren't particularly friendly but other than that the staff we encountered were all very welcoming and friendly. The cruise director Jeffrey was a hoot. All in all a good trip and looking forward to trying Harmony next (when it starts departing from Port Canaveral)."
5.0	Sail Date: Sep 09, 2018 /	We loved the Oasis. Such a beautiful ship.  The food was great. We enjoyed the shows. We loved our Junior Suite (btw thanks Royal Caribbean for the upgrade). The staff was so friendly and attentive to all our needs.
4.5	Sail Date: Sep 09, 2018 /	The large ship only felt large when you had to wait in line for things especially the buffet. They did a great job of making each venue feel small ind intimate. So much to do and so much fun to be had.
5.0	Sail Date: Sep 09, 2018 /	"All the reviews I had read prior to our sailing had me convinced all I was going to do was wait in long lines and have terrible food and be treated like crap.  Well they wwre wrong.... Yes 5 stars all the way. Never felt crowed. Super clean ship.  
Service was spectacular and quick.  The longest wait was for a drink on day 1. (maybe 7mins). Wonderful room steward.  Staff works hard and still smiles and are always willing to help!  I would do the Oasis class again in a heart beat.  I don't need someone to say my name every day to have a good time.  I can get that at work.  Go for it, and enjoy anybody who's worried.  You'll love her. Food selection is limited but there is plenty of food on the ship."
5.0	Sail Date: Sep 09, 2018 /	"This is my 4th cruise, and second time on this ship. Everything about this ship is amazing, even the second time. The food does seem to be the same every night in the main dining, but there are so many other options for breakfast, lunch, and dinner and everything in-between. If you change up the places you eat, you get different options. I don’t dine at speciality restaurants, except for Johnny Rockets at least once. 

My lady and I ended up becoming real close friends with 2 other couples. 

She ended up taking full advantage of the gym, and running/walking track around the ship and she loved it. 

The ship has a few areas that it can feel crowded. Such as breakfast in windjammer. Every cruise I have been on has been that way, I don’t think it will change. Feels crowded anytime there is an event going on the promenade, but to counter act that, there’s plenty of other ways to get around that area without going through all the people. 

We ended up becoming great friends with our room Attendent, to where he even hung out with us for a while on our last night and gave us his personal info to keep in touch with him. He took care of us in every way possible and even went above and beyond for things like always being there to unlock our door for us, supplied us robes even when we weren’t supposed to get any. Kept a bucket filled with fresh ice for me everyday, all day, made us several towel characters because we liked them so much. 

The ports were awesome. Haiti, Jamaica, and Cozumel. Haiti we spent 45 dollars for both of us to get a beach chair with a shade, in front of a bar that supplied us with their island slushees without alcohol so they were free to us with our drink packages, and really good! We had our own snorkel gear and swam around while watching everyone zip line by. Getting on and off the ship was a breeze. 

Jamaica we had a dune buggy adventure. It’s about an hr and a half ride away from the ship which is included in your price. I’d say it was well worth it being a pricey excursion. The buggy’s were awesome, the lunch included was awesome, and the tour of the 1000 acres of property was awesome. 

Cozumel was amazing, probably my new second favorite port, and we didn’t even do much. The water was breathtaking beautiful. The depth of the water while docked was 100 feet and you could see the rocks on the bottom. All we did was get off the ship, walk down the pier and had apps and margaritas at bubba gump shrimp. The price for us to eat and drink there was cheaper than most other excursions or resorts we could have gone to. They also have an area to swim and snorkel in the ocean which was awesome because of how close the ship was. Even tho it’s a chain restaurant the food and drinks tasted 100 percent authentic Mexican. 

The bad, I would say is all the shows they offer all seem to be at night. It’s almost hard to have a dinner without feeling rushed to get to a booked show or even multiple shows a night. During the day they had little to no shows going on. They lacked competitions, such as the belly flop competition, which always seemed to be a huge hit on my past 3 cruises, and I always enjoy taking part in the competition. The cruise director was the most boring I experienced out of my past cruises. You only ever saw him talking after a show had finished and all he did was tell you what other shows were happening that night. He was not fun, entertaining, or present around the ship. I didn’t even know who our cruise director was until half way through the trip. 

This ship gets a lot of bad reviews for the food, and feeling over crowded. My lady and I are in our early 30s, not people persons, and she’s a very picky eater, and we had a blast, and had zero issues with any of those."
4.3	Sail Date: Sep 09, 2018 /	Went on this crews to play pickleball and did not get enough time on the pickleball courts
5.0	Sail Date: Sep 09, 2018 /	Excellent cruise. We almost didn’t go on. We where at the hotel by the port packing up to go home. Hurricane Florance was heading for where we live but our family and friends said told us to go they will take care of everything. Good thing for VOOM on the ship. I was able to keep updated on the storm as well as talk with family at my house. In the end we were very lucky. The cruise was great and no damage at home. Even though it’s a week later there are still areas that are just now getting flood waters from the storm.
4.7	Sail Date: Sep 02, 2018 /	This ship is huge and beautiful.  Lots of theme nights which were so fun!  Speciality restaurants were wonderful!  Excellent staff except for salon which may be separate from RCL
4.5	Sail Date: Sep 02, 2018 /	This was our first time on Oasis of the seas. Our luggage was left behind, but Carribean cruises managed to find it and flew it onto Our first port of call Nassea and we just made the first formal night. The ship is beautiful, the staff couldn’t do enough for us , although we weren’t impressed with the food in fine dining, the starters and desserts were the same every night, andthe main course choice was limited, no variety ,  ertainly a disappointment for us. But the food on the wind jammer was amazing, a plenty of choice. Shows, Cats, didn’t really understand the story line, but that’s us. The comedian was so funny, but stayed clean , the ice show Frozen, brilliant really enjoyed it. We loved sitting on the promenade to watch the entertainment, and people watch. Relaxing, a very hard thing to do at home with our special needs daughter. There was always something going on. And if we wanted to be quiet, we would go to  enteral Park cafe. And sit in the beautiful real live park, full of plants and trees, and even birds tweeting.We were on a budget though, and everything was so expensive, drinks packages , WiFi,  even cost to watch something on the telly. Would I go again.....in a heart beat. Just have to save extra hard to pay for everything.
4.4	Sail Date: Sep 02, 2018 /	"Upon entering our cabin we found it to the bed to be messy, the sofa looked liked something you would find on the side of the road it was so dirty!!  The bathroom smelled liked vomit and found hair on the sink.

After reporting to guest service and the manager , we were told they were at capacity and couldn't change our room.  We persisted and did not leave guest services until they changed our cabin!  There was no way we were  letting our children sleep on that disgusting pull out sofa!!"
5.0	Sail Date: Sep 02, 2018 /	Great cruise, have fun, enjoy the company with all the people we meet.
3.9	Sail Date: Sep 02, 2018 /	We went on our honeymoon and we had a great time doing shire excursions and it the specialty restaurants were amazing. Lots of great shows and shopping. I’d do it again with a few changes.
4.9	Sail Date: Sep 02, 2018 /	"It was the best vacation! We could not have asked for a better first cruise. We are now hooked on cruising. From the minute we checked in at the port to disembarkation the staff so super friendly and we felt like family. Our Main dinning room servers were top notch. They would see us walk in and would have our drinks at the table waiting for us. The Food was AMAZING better then we expected it to be.  Our room attendant Anna Marie was wonderful as well. I loved the towel animals at night.  She was so friendly and when we saw her she would always say hi and ask how our cruise was going.  Like I said before ALL the staff was friendly and were always saying hi. As for our ports of call we went to Nassau, Bahamas, Charlotte Amalie, St. Thomas and Pilipsburg, St. Marrten. We scheduled all our excursions though the ship for Nassau we scheduled the Turtle Yatch snorkel but they ended up canceling it due to to much wind/unsafe conditions. We decided to just walk around the town for a little while. I wasn't too impressed. People were pretty rude. We maybe spent about 2 hours in town and got back on the ship and hung out in the Solarium. In St. Thomas Erin the Jewelry Expert from the ship took us into town to go shopping. We then went to Maghen's Bay. The drive and the beach was beautiful. You could still see some of the hurricane damage left over from Irma and Maria. It was so sad but the people were getting back on their feet and happy to have tourists back. St. Maarten we did the Great Bay Beach excursion. That was a nice beach the water taxi takes you over and you get free wifi and chairs with umbrella included. You can take the water taxi all day with this one. We also walked around the town and went to the Yoda guy museum. If your a Starwars fan this is a must. Nick Maley was there on the day we visited and it was neat to meet him and get his autograph. 
We will be back on the Oasis soon and bringing our children. Thank you Royal Caribbean for a wonderful vacation."
5.0	Sail Date: Sep 02, 2018 /	I had such an amazing time. I'm already preparing for my next cruise.
3.6	Sail Date: Sep 02, 2018 /	"Food was not impressive, in the dining room at all.  Buffet was good, lots to do on the ship.  Room attendant didn't even know our names, never introduced himself.  He was friendly, and kept a good room, but not interested in making it personal.  Unlike any other cruise I've ever taken.  Dining room service was slow and condiments where untimely, drinks were slow.  Wait staff assistance next to nil.  Ship itself is amazing, never felt crowded.  Casino layout is horrible, machines where super tight. There was no ""smoking"" side of the bar. Hardly any wait staff in the casino, and when we managed to find one, it was extremely slow to get back, and brought wrong drink order.  We spent enough to receive offers, but never any chocolate strawberries, or cookies, or anything from the casino.  Entertainment, shows were amazing aside from Cats, that was horrible.  Not a very happy crew, I've been on ships where all crew members were always smiling.  The Windjammer was the exception, they were all the best, happy and helpful.  If you start self-disembarkation 0630, then have coffee available at 0500 please and some snacks on the promenade deck - the deck we exit and line up on.  I think I prefer the smaller ships.  The attention to detail from crew and staff is much better."
5.0	Sail Date: Sep 02, 2018 /	Absolutely amazing! I never felt crowded, even with 5,000 + people. Staff were very nice. Every detail was amazing from our room to the dining experience.
5.0	Sail Date: Sep 02, 2018 /	"This was our first cruise on Royal Caribbean (our previous two were on Carnival), and we really enjoyed it. Oasis is a beautiful ship, with almost too much to see and do. Central Park is a lovely place to get ""away"" a bit from some of the noise and all of the public areas, and the Promenade was a great evening hang-out. Fun bars, good food, a variety of music, and world-class people watching!"
4.6	Sail Date: Sep 02, 2018 /	"For our first cruise I was very pleased with the ship and everything we did. Lots of excursions to choose from and the ship had so many activities to keep you busy all day. 
Food in the buffet was good and had a nice variety. Main dining was a delight and our waiter was one of the best I have ever had. water glass never emptied nor my tea... I  would do this cruise again in a minute."
4.7	Sail Date: Sep 02, 2018 /	This was our first cruise and we booked our next while on board! Our experience on the Oasis was on we will never forget! The vessel is magnificent, the staff super friendly and helpful and the entertainment is top notch! We are hooked!! Looking forward to many more days at Sea!
4.3	Sail Date: Sep 02, 2018 /	Ship was clean and lots to do with wonderful shows.Staff was very pleasant specially waiters Lidia and Lido from American Idol restaurant, we had a good lough with them! Have to take one star off because of the manager from Spa she was unfriendly and rude that badly surprised us but then we spotted smoothie bar and enjoyed having a chat while we were served with nice girl from Ukraine.
4.6	Sail Date: Aug 26, 2018 /	Food better than expected  zzzzzzzxzzzzzzzzzzzxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz
4.4	Sail Date: Aug 26, 2018 /	I love the large ship so many things to do and see I was worried there would be long waits for the elevators and there never was. Would go again in a heartbeat.
5.0	Sail Date: Aug 26, 2018 /	This cruise was beyond beautiful! Will do it again!
5.0	Sail Date: Aug 26, 2018 /	Just got off today on the oasis ,I wish I could stay on the ship longer ,it’s was great the ship is Awsome looking ,clean and really big lol ,the shows where fantastic,cats the diving show the ice show everything was great professional the food was awesome I must of gained 7 pounds lol the waiter and waitress we had at the grand dining were the best yoven ,claire and Ian were without a dought like family, the ports were great maho beach was crazy how the planes came down close to the beach I loved it ,Puerto Rico was great even with the rain and haiti was beautiful I’d cruise the oasis again without question
4.9	Sail Date: Aug 26, 2018 /	First cruise and spoiled. Hope are next RC cruise goes even better.
3.0	Sail Date: Aug 19, 2018 /	This was my first cruise with Royal Caribbean. The ship is huge and the staff was awesome. I loved my room attendant, Anthony, and main dining team, Nitin and Imade. Aside from the crowd my main issue with the ship was  stale food ranging from the croutons to hard bread during main dining. The ultimate drink package for alcohol was a ridiculous price, $63.00 per person per day. There weren't enough soda machines for those who purchased unlimited soft drinks, $8.50 per person per day.  Two on deck 5, 1 on deck 15 in Arcade (machine is usually empty or limited options), and 4 on deck 16 in Windjammer buffet). Maybe there are more that I didn't see but I shouldn't have to go hunting for something I paid for. Back to the crowd as another reviewer said pools, elevators,  and dining areas were packed with people which you should expect based on the ship size. I suggest getting to Windjammer between 7 and 8am. This will give you time to eat and get a good spot by the pool of your choice. There are several other breakfast options but  I frequented the Windjammer.
4.6	Sail Date: Aug 19, 2018 /	I enjoyed the cruise the activities, all of staff was always 💯.
4.8	Sail Date: Aug 19, 2018 /	Great cruise with much to do. You will only be bored due to your decisions. Good food, good photos and shows and mingle with the people. The All access tour is great.
5.0	Sail Date: Aug 19, 2018 /	Very relaxing cruise.  Disembarkation was the easiest of any cruise we've been on.
4.2	Sail Date: Aug 19, 2018 /	The experience was great and the staff were very attentive, courteous, friendly and extremely helpful.  Special thanks to Bar staff Rohan, Spa attendee Monique, American Icon waitress Katherine ( Kenya) and room attendee, Harold. Harold made sure our room was kept very neat
5.0	Sail Date: Aug 19, 2018 /	We would absolutely sail again. It was totally worth it. We loved Oasis and our experience.
4.3	Sail Date: Aug 12, 2018 /	Our cruise was on one of the biggest ships Royal has to offer in the Oasis.  Despite the fact that it is going in to drydock for upgrades, it appears very new and nice.  First the cons:   1) CROWDS!  There are big big crowds on this ship and especially when at sea, you really can feel it.  2) The Windjammer was very crowded at times and sometimes people had to wait.  3) The pools were very crowded leaving little space to swim - mostly to stand and marinate.  4) The sporting events like basketball, zipline and flow rider were overcrowded as well.  5) the MDR menus were average.  But this ship was marvelous aside from the crowd factors.  Amazing shows, specialty restaurants, & the views were amazing.  Staff is very friendly and accommodating but I think stretched to work on this ship.
3.0	Sail Date: Aug 12, 2018 /	I would choose a smaler ship the next time. Not because of the 8000 guest but for the lag of good Food and other special Services or Programs on board. There was no quiettime and nothing special for me. You feel like you are on a selling Tour all the time, everything costs extra and they bother you even with messages om buying there stuff over the roomphone and messages over your room tv, Flyer in your room and every where you walk.
5.0	Sail Date: Aug 12, 2018 /	Everything was 5 Star! Royal Caribbean is the best!
4.8	Sail Date: Aug 12, 2018 /	This was first cruise and the best experience ever. Staff was impeccable and activities catered to everyone. What a great ship, great people and superb organization.
5.0	Sail Date: Aug 12, 2018 /	"The best of the best! The ship is awesome and has something to offer to all types of cruisers. Our kids enjoyed the kids activities and the Pool areas. There was so much to do on the ship we haven’t been able to do it all. The entire staff onboard the ship was amazing and always smiling and willing to help with anything. Our waiter Vedat at the Grande restaurant was the coolest and funniest and took the best care of us. He also made our kids cool balloon creations each night after dinner. Go and see The Doctor, a bartender at the Sands bar on the 15 deck and ask him for his custom drink. 
This was by far the best cruising experience and would highly recommend!!!"
5.0	Sail Date: Aug 12, 2018 /	The Oasis was amazing! The service was amazing and the entertainment was wonderful. Our stewardess Griselda was awesome! In the main dining room, Gabriel and Nitin were the best waiters I’ve ever had. Labadee was our favorite stop.
4.7	Sail Date: Aug 05, 2018 /	"This was our first cruise and we had a blast.  There was so much to do and so much to eat, seriously there is so much food.  The shows were amazing, the parties were a blast and the food abundant.  We checked out almost all of the restaurants and bars, our go to was the piano bar.  There was great staff and the singer there was always wonderful.  We also really enjoyed Dazzles, the two story bar.  Great performances there.  

Entertainment:
The shows were all amazing, we saw Come Fly with Me , Oasis of Dreams, The Headliner (Juggling/Comedy) and the comedy show.  We loved them all (we missed Cats but that's ok) although some of the story lines we couldn't follow very well but the overall performance was amazing.


Food:

 Main Dining room for my time dining really pushed eating in excess a bit much, a few of our staff seemed annoyed if we didn't eat everything and would offer us additional food.  Even after we explained the food was great, we were just full from eating all day long.  But the food was always good and I'm amazed at how well they pull off delivery of your food, not once did we ever have over lapping meals sitting on our table nor did we wait long in between.
150 Central park was amazing, if we could only do one special dining option that would be it.  Each course was amazing and worth the extra money if you're a foodie.  Our waiter walked through each option and even made added suggestions to add to our experience.
Sabor was good, but not a lot of options.  You basically can have taco's or quesidilla's, it was good but we'd probably pass next time in our opinion.
Chop's was good, although I was a bit concerned that they wouldn't serve their burgers under medium well.  For a steak place that's a bit concerning that they won't do medium rare so I ended up going with the chicken which was very good.
Giovanni's we had the first night as part of the first night done right package, it was great.  I had the filet, which was not only huge but delicious.
Izumi - We didn't actually have a meal here but did do the Sushi Making class and it was a blast.  The staff was very patient and walked everyone through making sushi.  If you have the time it was a great class.

Bars:
Schooner Bar - This is the Piano bar and our go to bar at the end of the day.  Wonderful staff while we were there and the performance was great.  It also gave us a prime location for any of the parades and parties held just underneath us.
Dazzles - We went twice and each time was great.  The first night we were there they had an orchestra performing show tunes and later on the cast from Cat's came and sang songs.  The other night they had a Michael Jackson dance party, it sounds nuts but we had a blast.
Jazz Club (sorry forgot the name) was very nice and relaxed, we went a couple time to just sit and enjoy a nice cognac while listening to some live jazz performed.
Champagne Bar - Very nice and easy location, we only went once but it was very nice.

We completely enjoyed our experience on Oasis of the Seas and glad we chose it for our first cruise.  There is so much to do every day and our activities director Dan the Man was awesome, I swear that guy never sleeps.  Our only real complaint would be the size/amount of pools in comparison to the amount of people on board (6,000+ when we cruised).  On at sea days they were beyond packed, this may be the norm but for a first timer was a bit disappointing.  The other part that concerned me was the special shopping on board, they advertised huge discounts for watches and jewelry but when I googled some of the watches I found them for much less from the manufacturer than what was being marked as 75% off on ship.  

Beyond those two items we would highly recommend Oasis of the Seas and we loved our Oceanview Balcony very nice to wake up in the morning and sit and drink coffee staring at the amazing blue of the sea or our port of call."
4.8	Sail Date: Aug 05, 2018 /	We had a great time!!  I feared it feeling too crowded  with how many people were aboard, but it never felt crowded.  There are neighborhoods on the ship and things are well spaced out.  We rarely waited more than a couple minutes for a table at the Windjammer for breakfast and never had a problem finding chairs by the pool.  The Globe and Atlas is a fabulous little pub!!!
4.6	Sail Date: Aug 05, 2018 /	Went with son and family including 17 year old twins. Had wonderful family time. Rainbow reef snorkeling in Nassau and St. John at Trunk Bay snorkeling. Very nice double deck bus tour in Snt Marteen.
4.6	Sail Date: Jul 29, 2018 /	"I would highly recommend the Royal Caribbean Oasis of the Sea to anyone for any sort of vacation or occasion. Our family booked a row of 5 balcony rooms on Deck 8 plus one more a few doors down for our family vacation. This trip was a first time cruise for about 6 of us. We enjoyed being able to sit out on the balcony in the morning/evening or when we were coming into port. Our stateroom attendant, (I’m sorry, I forgot his name, but my room was 8136) consistently went above and beyond to make us feel at home, highly personable, went of his way to ensure everything in our room was to our satisfaction and along with the other housekeeping staff. This team did what they could to make us welcomed aboard.

The food and service in the American Icon dining room were top notch. We were so impressed by our servers, Nelson and Amoor (I think that’s how you spell is name), we actually reserved our table in their section every night. We were highly pleased with it with all available selections. Honestly, we didn’t bother spending the money on the specialty restaurants. And I MUST mention the AMAZING bartenders at the Trellis Bar in the Central Park Deck 8 area of the ship. Virgillo, Archie and Shawna were nothing less than the BEST OF THE BEST bartenders. They always treated us with top notch service. My name is L'Oreal and the simple fact that EVERYTIME I would pass, they would speak and actually remember my name speaks VOLUMES for this crew. This team truly rocks! (I must also shout out to William. He opened the Trellis one afternoon and remembered me that same evening in the American Icon bar!)

The activities on the ship were a lot of fun too. You could make the trip as relaxed or as busy as you wanted. We loved the fact that there was SO much to do we could not fit it all into our schedules. Even though we missed our shows due to our family dinners, I heard they were awesome. The FlowRider competition was pretty cool to watch. We also watched the World’s Sexiest Man contest which was HILARIOUS and fun! I must also make mention of the DreamWorks Parade! This was TRULY one of my favorite experiences aboard! I felt like a kid again and danced around with my little cousin who was just as mesmerized as I was. 

Our ports were Labadee, Haiti; Falmouth, Jamaica and Cozumel, Mexico. The beautiful blue waters of the Caribbean will always be etched in my memory. I’m sure none of my family will ever forget this family vacation. We enjoyed the RCC event held in Labadee and the shopping. In Falmouth, we did the Fun in the Sun excursion to Doctor Cave’s Beach Club. We did enjoy seeing the school and field where Usain Bolt learned and trained. The beach was beautiful. We also had to joy of watching planes landing at the airport just north of us. Finally in Cozumel, we took a taxi downtown to do some shopping. We then took another taxi to Paradise Beach. This place is just beautiful and full of a broad range of activities. The culture here in Mexico is rich and I sincerely wanted more time there.

All in all, it was the most amazing family vaction we could ask for. Thank you Royal Caribbean and Oasis of the Seas! We will definitely be back! (However, disembarked Aug. 5th 2018. As of Aug. 8th, we have booked Family Vacation 2019 on Allure of the Seas. No worries, Oasis, we’ll be back!)"
4.9	Sail Date: Jul 29, 2018 /	Ship was very nice and the food in Windjammer was much better than main dinner room. Overall better varieties.
5.0	Sail Date: Jul 29, 2018 /	This was my first time with Royal Caribbean and I truly enjoyed myself. Would have never known we had that many people on ship. That are many places to eat that are not included but enough great food that you don’t have to pay. Nice to have options!
3.6	Sail Date: Jul 29, 2018 /	Overall, we loved our vacation. Half of us was turned off with how much the company charged for every little thing. This includes having our clothes pressed for the captains night. They didn't have room robes available for the guest. Their drink and meal packages was too high. We purchased excursions with VIP status in Mexico and still had to wait in lines, and had to use old mildew life jackets for the excursion at the Playa Mia beach break excursion.  The room attendant and dining crew was amazing. They definitely went out of their way to accommodate us as much as they could.
3.5	Sail Date: Jul 29, 2018 /	Overall great cruise for our family of 9 from 13 to 85. But service could have been better
5.0	Sail Date: Jul 29, 2018 /	After my first Two cruises which I did not enjoy this was a complete surprise...so much to do the food choices were excellent and the staff very competent.   I would definitely recommend this cruise line to my friends.  A great experience overall!
5.0	Sail Date: Jul 29, 2018 /	My overall experience was wonderful, loved everything, the staff were all lovely our cabin food drinks all amazing.
5.0	Sail Date: Jul 29, 2018 /	It was my first time to cruise but definitely will do it again can’t wait
5.0	Sail Date: Jul 29, 2018 /	This cruise was awesome!  So much to do and see!  I booked my next cruise while on board so I can experience everything the has to offer!
4.8	Sail Date: Jul 29, 2018 /	We had the very best time ever!!! No complaints!!!
4.3	Sail Date: Jul 22, 2018 /	"Overall this cruise was excellent. After a little guffaw with our luggage, our room was great. The formal dining was very nice, although we do wish the Head Waiter could enforce ‘formal’ on the two formal nights. The ship was very clean overall with the noted odor of mildew.
Long story short, it was over way too soon!"
4.7	Sail Date: Jul 22, 2018 /	I had fun but I never want to on a 7 day cruise again I got tired of all the swaying eventually. I loved the food. Amazing service loved the waiters.
4.5	Sail Date: Jul 22, 2018 /	"Most everything was great. 

Embarkation went fairly smooth. Being first cruisers, we didn't quite understand the ""colored cards"" we were ""green group 5"" but just heard ""group 5"" though it was ""gold group 5"" that was called. The lady taking the cards to allow boarding was very understanding and let us go anyway soooo that was a plus since we boarded before we were supposed to, without the embarrassment of her calling us out. I am putting it in my review so people can understand to be sure to listen for colors and numbers because it wasn't made clear when we were handed the card at check-in.  

Food and drink: Breakfast: Food in the windjammer (2 morning) for breakfast is not sooo good and unless you get there super early (so I heard) there is nowhere to sit. We ate in the solarium for breakfast 3 mornings and it was good. Not as busy and while there is less offered, it was mainly the same stuff as in the windjammer just not so much and replenished quicker instead of sitting under those lamps for a while. We skipped breakfast on disembarkation day and one port day. 
Lunch: Johnny rockets one afternoon, was good (up-charge). hot dog stand a couple times for lunch and snacks and cafe prom was all just ok. We ate at wipeout cafe on embarkation day and it was ok but over crowded. 
Dinner: ""my time in American icon"" We never had the same table/server in the dining room...in fact the first night they sent us up to ""silk"" (dining room on 5th) food was good in both the dining rooms we were in. We did room service once...not good at all. And pizza at Sorrento's for dinner once because we napped through out reservation. We also went to the windjammer for dinner twice and it was way better than breakfast. 
Overall: We would have liked to see bar food. You can't get food in any of the bars. I'm sure they have their reasons for this but even outside the bars, there is no ""bar food"" I love me some nachos and wings...
Drinks: We didn't use any of the freestyle machines, though they seemed to work well when we seen them (short lines). We just ordered soda, water or alcohol in the bars. 
Speaking of alcohol/bar: favorite was ""on air"" and the bartender Heidi was awesome. We loved her instantly. Micheal was her helper (same shift) and was also very good. In fact the 4 person crew in there was great. They do rotate throughout the ship every couple weeks from what we were told so you may have to check around if you want a fun experience with them. 

Activities: Lots of stuff to do...unfortunately not for us. We are not trivia fans and don't sing, so karaoke wasn't our thing but most of the people singing were very good so nice entertainment. Bingo was big but at a cost and well...while we like internet bingo games, we don't like paying to play. I think maybe they could have done free bingo like the trivia and given away the same kinds of prizes (hats, t-shirts and such).

Entertainment: We were very disappointed. Three of the shows (2 Broadway shows and the one at the aqua theater), we reserved were cancelled. Mechanical issues (should have had the part readily available to fix) Injury...do they not have backups? they should. The one show (aqua) was rescheduled but then as we walked up to get in line for it, they canceled it. These shows being cancelled left us with nothing to do but feed our faces, drink more and/or just wander around or nap. The adult comedy show was good, slightly vulgar. Frozen, was really cool and we enjoyed it very much. Such beautiful choreography. We were super happy to see it.

Ship was clean though there were some stains in the carpets. Bathrooms everywhere were very clean. Bars and dining rooms smelled clean (y'all know what dirty dining and bars smell like haha) The only place that we noticed any issue was on the 12th floor about mid-ship, port side...musky smell...must have been a flood of some sort there at some point. All staff was friendly and helpful."
5.0	Sail Date: Jul 22, 2018 /	"Just got off a fabulous week on the oasis of the seas. I will try to be as detailed as possible in my review but I will review the ports of call separately. To say that everything was perfect from embarkation to disembarkation is a mild statement.

Embarkation: these people have it down to a T. They truly know what they are doing. From the smiles on their faces you would not be able to tell that there were 6475 people were checking in to board that ship. They handled all passengers was such an ease like there were only 50 of them. Everything was very smooth. We were on board the ship in a matter of 25 minutes.

Ship: The ship is massive, magnificent, and so beautiful. Everything was spotless. We were in room 9578, a mid/fwd cabin with an excellent location away from the elevators and awesome views. Our room steward, Aris was incredible. It did not matter what time you left the room, if you returned in less than 10 minutes the room was made up and spotless. He attended to every need, made us feel comfortable and welcomed at all times.

Food: we went to the wind jammer only ones when we embarked, the food was good and the service was great however I am not fond of buffet style food or the crowds and the buffet so we opted for eating breakfast and dinner in the main dining room. We were waiting on by Ariel who was absolutely magnificent. He took an incredible care of us on nightly basis with recommendations and speed of service. You are allowed to bring two bottles of wine per cabin. You can bring a bottle or two of wine to dinner and they will uncork it for you free of charge. Our head waiter was Robinson, both Robinson and Ariel re-defined the meaning of customer service. What an amazing team. The food in the main dining room was absolutely delicious from the appetizers to the desserts. Everything was freshly made and very very tasty.

Entertainment: of course you need to book all the shows in advance. We went to see Cats, I was not impressed with the performance and in speaking with other passengers who I am not on the ship they were of the same opinion. Headliner Cheryl was disappointing as well. Come fly with me was absolutely adorable, excellent talents and great performance. Oasis of dreams was absolutely stunning great talents great show. Frozen in time absolutely adorable show great dancing great talent great music.

Venues: My favorite bar was globe and atlas on the Royal promenade. 70s party was absolutely great excellent music great performances lotta fun. The boardwalk was very nice reminds one of all times at the beach. Central Park gorgeous absolutely gorgeous, Great atmosphere gorgeous views soft music great drinks. Exactly as if you are in central park New York.

In conclusion this was an incredible week aboard an incredible ship serviced by amazing crew and staff. Thank you thank you Royal Caribbean for For creating an incredible vacation for our family and there’s always a reason why I am loyal to only royal Caribbean"
4.0	Sail Date: Jul 22, 2018 /	Overall a great cruise!  Plenty of activities for us and to keep my 10 & 13 year old sons entertained.  The food was delicious overall.  Chop’s Grill & Giovanni’s were excellent, as well as Sorrento’s.  A few complaints about the process of RCI excursions, but with so many people, I’m sure it’s hard to move everyone quickly.  I was also disappointed with the Vitality Spa’s thermal suite package (I’m comparing to Disney Dream’s Senses Spa thermal suite day pass which is the same price and far superior.)  I did receive a wonderful Swedish massage.  Embarkation/disembarkation went smoothly.  Got to my car and couldn’t find my car keys.  I realized I left them in the safe in the stateroom.  The RCI port folks radioed up and I waited only 10 to 15 minutes to receive my keys.  Wonderful service from them as well as our room attendant, wait staff and guest services.  I would definitely recommend.
4.4	Sail Date: Jul 22, 2018 /	We had a very good time on our cruise. we were with two other couples and really enjoyed the ship. Only disappointment was the cancellation of 3 of the shows.
3.0	Sail Date: Jul 22, 2018 /	"Before this is attacked by die hard cruisers or Oasis fanatics just remember that this is a cruise critique website designed for opinions and it’s totally OK for our opinions to be different. Before I booked our cruise I diligently read these reviews and it’s important for everyone’s voice be heard even if you “love cruising and/or oasis class ships”. This is my third cruise, and probably my last for reasons listed below. With that being said:

Pros: 

Embarkation/Disembarkation: Super easy. Seriously, awesome. We stayed at the Radisson the night before and took the shuttle, it was super easy. 

Room: Awesome attendant, Dom! Our three year old loved him and he was very friendly and kept everything super clean. 

Service: Overall, really fantastic. There were a couple of rare occasions of poor service but really outstanding crew. They should be paid more for sure. 

Specialty dining: we went to Giovanni’s, Choppes, Izumi, Johnny Rockets, and Park 150. Service was excellent each time and I loved all the appetizers and main courses. Unfortunately they all needed work in the dessert dept. some of the deserts were the same ones in the main dining room. 

Cons: 

Free Dining: By day 7 everything tasted the same. We weren’t initially planning on going to so many specialty dining restaurants but we had to switch it up which is probably by design. If you are going to pay thousands of dollars per person then the free food should be a little more appetizing. Wish there were more free snack options for kids such as chips or candy, our youngest ate like 10 pb&js when he got home because there were none to be found on the ship. I didn’t really mind it but it was rough on all the kids with us. Hamburgers and hotdogs got really old. 

Excursions: We went to the blue Lagoon, Magen’s Bay and Orient Beach. Was not impressed with the locals on St. Thomas but Nassau and St. Maarten were very friendly. My biggest complaint is how stressful it is getting on and off the ship from excursions and how rushed it is getting from place to place. It’s not relaxing at all and I would have loved to see more of the island and stay longer. This is the biggest reason I’ve decided to not cruise again, I want to do more on the island and get to know the locals better. 

Entertainment: My son loved going to Aquanauts, the crew were fantastic. There was also a lot to do that we admittedly couldn’t even get to because we were so tired from daily activities. I had reserved show tickets months in advance but all but two were cancelled. I understand there were mechanical problems and things happen but it was a little ridiculous. My mom was really disappointed since this is one of the things she was looking forward to the most. We were able to make it to the comedy show and I thought both comedians were funny. 

Pools: unbelievably crowded and too many people reserving chairs with towels for extended periods of time. I know I could have moved their stuff but that’s just not my style, I try not to tell others how to live their lives but it sucks when you’re just trying to soak up some rays. 

Other Passengers: This was the worst part of the cruise and another reason why I am never taking another cruise. People are extremely rude and selfish, especially when it comes to elevators, buffet lines, or pool chairs. Everyone seemed so self absorbed and entitled that it was somewhat baffling. We are all here to have a good time and relax which was pretty hard to do when others are pushing past you. Too many people, not enough space. 

✌🏼"
4.3	Sail Date: Jul 22, 2018 /	We have sailed RCCL 4 times and this time was pretty disappointing.  The meals and service were fantastic, but the cruise compass was constantly wrong and not very well organized.  Both theaters had parts go bad that caused cancellations of shows and there was much about the ship that was subpar - it almost seemed as if the ship was too large to keep up with.
4.9	Sail Date: Jul 22, 2018 /	"We had a very good time. However we were very disappointed about most of our shows being cancelled. 
Especially,  since no one really seemed to be concerned about our feelings, regarding the issue after many visits to guest services. Basically told sorry about your luck."
4.1	Sail Date: Jul 15, 2018 /	RC needs to step up their service in the food category.  You should NOT have to pay to eat great on this cruise.  Lacking in the quality I have come to accept from RC.
4.8	Sail Date: Jul 15, 2018 /	The Oasis of the Seas is a beautiful ship.  It is large but laid out so even a 7-year old can find her way around.  We have been on several ships and this one is our favorite!  Book your excursions early.
2.9	Sail Date: Jul 15, 2018 /	Overall very average for a Royal Caribbean Cruise. Sail away party on day 1 was lifeless. Cruise director was not present and nobody was on the microphone to get people involved. Out of 6000+ people only 20-25 were on the deck for the party. No announcements were made in the mornings. Comedy shows and comedians was below average. Every single joke was repeated between the kids and adults show. Not enough entertainment compared to carnival. Our steward was fine but our kids room was not getting cleaned properly. Soap and shampoo was not getting replenished until requested.  Our bathroom had a leak from shower and the whole floor outside the shower was getting flooded after every shower use. We complained to guest services but no action was taken. We had to use 2 full size towels everyday to keep it from happening. Very poor service. Food was decent but an omlette live station and a taco live station in windjammer would have been nice. Very little variety in food. Again, food and food service was below expectation.
5.0	Sail Date: Jul 15, 2018 /	"I loved this ship so much I did not want to leave! I was literally never bored there was always something to do. 

Food/dining 
Amazing the food was always so great. You could tell they put a lot of work into the food!

Embarking/Debarking 
Very smooth even though we lost our grandparents so we had to find them but we just flew right on and off the ship!

Service
Very nice people we had a great server and assistant server in the dining room. And everyone was super nice!

Room 
We had room 11502 and it was perfect I enjoyed being literally right at the front!"
5.0	Sail Date: Jul 15, 2018 /	This was our first cruise and we had an amazing time! I highly recommend the Oasis!!
4.6	Sail Date: Jul 15, 2018 /	"First time on the Oasis of the Seas and Royal Carribean.  It was my husband and I and we had a wonderful time!! This ship is massive!!  So much to see and explore.  We enjoyed the shows except Cats was boring to me.  The food was good we did MDR early seating.  Our waiters were fantastic. Our room was always clean.  We usually do interior but did Central Park Balcony and it was very nice but we just don't utilize the balcony plus there was no air movement so it was just hot.  
Loved the Solarium and the Promenade!!  We had a fabulous trip."
4.8	Sail Date: Jul 15, 2018 /	WE had a blast on this cruise.  I have food intolerances and they took care of my needs and prepared foods for me specifically.   Our room was clean, the service was amazing and the kids had a blast.  Booked another cruise for the 2 of us for our next anniversary next year.
4.9	Sail Date: Jul 08, 2018 /	A great holidays, huge ship,nice room,very comfy bed,loved the balcony.
4.8	Sail Date: Jul 08, 2018 /	This was a fantastic cruise. The Oasis was a wonderful ship. I loved her and will be vacationing on her again. I really enjoyed the whole vacation. My son and I had a true bonding experience.
4.9	Sail Date: Jul 08, 2018 /	La que limpió nuestro cuarto súper... Dos en específicos en el restaurante the grande el servicio fue excelente... no me acuerdo del nombre pero en general todo MARAVILLOSO
5.0	Sail Date: Jul 08, 2018 /	First time on an Oasis class ship and I loved it. Could not complain at all!! So many activities you were never bored, staff were great and our server Francisco was lovely, he would even bring us extra food from time to time.
4.8	Sail Date: Jul 08, 2018 /	We book this Western Caribbean (Labadee, Falmouth Jamaica and Cozumel Mexico) cruise about week before sailing and found a great price. This was second time on the Oasis and first visited the Eastern Caribbean (San Juan, St Thomas and Labadee). Well worth the money. Added the drink and ultimate specialty restaurant package so we never made it to main dining room. One of the largest ships like floating city and it was very smooth ride even after hurricane.
4.5	Sail Date: Jul 08, 2018 /	One thing I love about my cruise was that I was never in my room, I was always doing something fun. The food was delicious, the activities were awesome, and the shows that were being held were fun and enjoyable. I had a great time and hope to cruise again on the oasis of the seas sometime in the future.
4.1	Sail Date: Jul 08, 2018 /	Staff efficient on getting the passengers on and off the ship upon embarking and each port of call. The staff was friendly and very accommodating. Didn’t enjoy the lines at each meal and the use of the elevators. Needed more pools for the amount of passengers. Needed to have better communication on making reservations for every activitiy prior to embarking.
4.9	Sail Date: Jul 01, 2018 /	It was a great week. We had a blast. We went for our honeymoon and I couldn’t have asked for a better experience overall with my husband.
4.2	Sail Date: Jul 01, 2018 /	This was my first cruise and I thought it was excellent! I will definitely sail with royal again and go on oasis of the seas again!!
4.9	Sail Date: Jul 01, 2018 /	This was my husband’s and I’s 3rd cruise with Royal Caribbean and we will continue to book with them. Another great cruise! Already want to go back
5.0	Sail Date: Jul 01, 2018 /	We had a great experience! My husband and kids enjoyed the ship. The Babies and Tots staff was amazing. My daughter stayed in kids camp.  Can't wait to go back on the any ship in the Oasis class.
4.7	Sail Date: Jun 24, 2018 /	My family loved this cruise so much we booked another for next June on the Anthem of the Seas. Not everything is going to be perfect. With each cruise you learn more and more. There were a few things I wasn't completely happy about BUT..I would do this cruise over and over again because it's that beautiful and the staff were great.
4.7	Sail Date: Jun 24, 2018 /	Great trip.  Group included ages 3 to 65 and there was something for everyone.  The staff interacted with the children to make them feel part of the trip.
5.0	Sail Date: Jun 17, 2018 /	Had a ball on the Oasis!!!! Cant wait until they allow me to book a cruise in 2020 for the Royal but everything was wonderful and exciting!! Staff was great!!!
5.0	Sail Date: Jun 17, 2018 /	My daughter and I are first time cruisers and our experience was amazing! My husband has cruised with Carnival and Royal a few times. This was his first on the Oasis also. Some of the seasoned cruisers say she looks a little tired. I guess since this is my first cruise ever and with her, I did not notice at all and I even tried to look for wear and tear after reading comments on this app.  Maintenance on board is 24/7 so maybe that's why I didn't see anything. I'd say she is well taken care of and after listening to the Captain during a show I would say they care so much to make your experience outstanding. The food was great, the events were topnotch, and the activities were so much fun. You never run out of things to do and she's huge so be ready. Our housekeeper greeted us every day and night and introduced himself and called us by our names. I'm amazed at how they stay so happy after dealing with so many people day in and say out week after week during peak times and then they do it all over again. Get on the Oasis before she goes into dry dock next year for refurbishing, although I'm sure when she returns she will be even more amazing. You won't regret it!
5.0	Sail Date: Jun 17, 2018 /	"We had an absolutely fantastic cruise! Our second time on the Oasis and she was just as amazing as the first time. The food was outstanding and the entertainment is always incredible. 

You can tell she’s in need of some repair so I can’t wait to see what they do after her dry dock next year! We’ll be back on her again in the future!"
4.1	Sail Date: Jun 17, 2018 /	"Good news:  ports and excursions were fun.  Balcony was fun since we had three rooms connected.  Food was adequate and shows were really good.  

Bad news:  they lost luggage between boarding of the ship and our room!  No clothes the entire trip.  They don’t sell appropriate clothes on the ship unless you wear T-shirt’s with a big Royal Caribbean logo or shorts with fringe.  They offered $300 to replace thousands of dollars lost.  Be careful while walking around the ship on slippery floors.  I fell and broke my tailbone.  My mom also fell and got a concussion.  We met a lady in the elevator that was leaving on day 2 because of a fall and she was worried about a break in her pelvis."
4.2	Sail Date: Jun 17, 2018 /	"The cruise quality has deminished. I was very disappointed. This is my 12th cruise and I am a diamond member. I’m very disappointed!
I can’t believe I was charge for 3 extra days of WiFi. Very disappointed again."
4.9	Sail Date: Jun 17, 2018 /	Oasis is a beautiful ship and this is a wonderful itinerary. The Oasis of Dreams show is amazing, the talent on the ship was wonderful. The food was excellent and the staff went above and beyond. I can't imagine a better vacation. We booked our next cruise onboard, and are going to sail on the Symphony of the Seas!  Can't wait!!
4.2	Sail Date: Jun 17, 2018 /	Loved the cruise. This was the first time food was disappointing but everything else was great.
4.3	Sail Date: Jun 17, 2018 /	Being that this was my first cruise it was nice that we had a suite, the lines getting on and off were long but not if you had a suite.  If I had not had a suite I would not have not enjoyed this cruise.  First time and last time cruising.  It's just not for me.
3.9	Sail Date: Jun 17, 2018 /	"Royal Caribbean Customer service is horrible before boarding.
I was treated very badly by a Royal Caribbean Customer service Rep due to a problem with my reservations (plural). I did not cancel the whole trip because we were celebrating our 20th wedding anniversary, my oldest daughter's high school graduation and her 18th B-day. My wife asked me not to do it. But they way they treated me shows the lack of integrity this company has and how poorly customer oriented they are.
I have to be fair, the service and the experience once we boarded the ship was good. I can tell that they spend money and effort on educating their employees on board the ship, on how to treat the passengers.
I put a check mark on my bucket list on the ""to make a cruise for the Caribbean"" 
You can get a front beach house in the Dominican Republic, Costa Rica or many others very attractive destinies, for 8 to 10 days, food included, a butler and a maid, for the whole family for the same amount of money that I spent for a 7 days cruise for 5 people. And I will avoid the hassle of dealing with Royal Caribbean customer service.
BTW, I am still trying to understand all the charges they made to my credit card. They are experts on making things complicated for their customers. Nothing is simple and user-friendly.
Hope my comments help you take the right decision."
3.0	Sail Date: Jun 17, 2018 /	Cruised on Oasis and was disappointed. Food in windjammer was the same every day,  very little variety. Exhaust fan in bathroom didn't work and was never fixed. AC wasn't adequate for the really hot weather in port, especially in the stairway and elevator. Many activities on the schedule didn't happen. Pools were so crowded you couldn't get in if you weren't there first thing in the morning. Redeeming feature was the service of staff and entertainment, especially the Temperature band. Will go on Royal Caribbean again but not this one.
4.0	Sail Date: Jun 17, 2018 /	"Had a wonderful cruise on the Oasis! We went with our adult children and their spouses, and had a great time. 

PROS:
-The ship itself is amazing. Loved Central Park! (And loved being on deck 8 nearby.)  I will say, I enjoy smaller ships, as well. You often didn’t feel like you were on a cruise ship, and that’s not always a positive for me. It still amazes me that there were over 6,000 passengers! It rarely felt crowded. 
-Service was consistently good on the ship, from our room steward, to waitstaff, bartenders, etc. 
- enjoyed the entertainment and shows! If you look hard enough, there’s always something to do.

CONS: 
- MDR FOOD! One of the reasons we fell in love with cruising is the whole main dining room dinner experience. Unfortunately, we found the MDR food to be mediocre at best. There were a few really good dishes, but most were mediocre, with a few really bad standouts. (For example, a steak that was a really weird texture and taste, and my “pappardelle carbonara” that was a plate of Parmesan noodles- no meat, no greenery whatsoever, and some of the noodles were dried out.) We had dinner in the Windjammer one night, and enjoyed that food more. If we did this cruise again, I’d get the dining package and eat at the extra-cost restaurants most nights. 
-the photo shop. Very disorganized and inefficient. Our pics didn’t even show up most of the time, or would show up in someone else in our party’s folder. (Despite giving the photographer OUR sea pass.) Too much of my precious cruise time wasted in line! If I hadn’t wanted a few of the prints so badly, I would’ve skipped it. 

Again, overall a wonderful cruise! Loved the ship and the ports. I must say, after not having cruised with Royal for a long time, I was expecting to be blown away and was prepared to ditch Carnival, LOL.  That didn’t happen. You can’t compare Royal’s ships, but service and food are just as good (or better) on Carnival for the price. So I guess I’ll have to continue to cruise both lines!! Somebody’s got to do it, right fellow cruisers?!"
4.5	Sail Date: Jun 10, 2018 /	We’ve been on the Oasis 18 times and continue to have positive and wonderful experiences. Our only minor hiccups on this sailing were the TV in the stateroom suddenly stopped working (but was fixed the same day) and the World Cup was only shown in the On Air club instead of the Aqua Theater.
5.0	Sail Date: Jun 10, 2018 /	We had a excellent experience.  Food, entertainment, activities and staff were outstanding.
4.8	Sail Date: Jun 10, 2018 /	Overall the cruise was great. It had good food good staff and good entertainment
4.6	Sail Date: Jun 10, 2018 /	Marta our housekeeping lady was the absolute best!  She was so courteous and just amazing with my baby boy.  The staff everywhere were absolutely wonderful, just the care and friendliness of everyone made the vacation an incredibly relaxing experience. I would absolutely go again!  Thank You!
4.0	Sail Date: Jun 10, 2018 /	It was definitely good.  I however just cant give it five stars.  Maybe in its day it was.  Just not these days.  Still glad i got on her.  Definitely recommend her to others.
4.4	Sail Date: Jun 10, 2018 /	Staff very friendly and accommodating.  Food was excellent in MDR, Chops grill & Chef's Table.  Central Park not so much (only the steak filet was good). Coastal Kitchen was good too.  Buffet's scrambled eggs very fresh (a good hint of other items).  Pool bars were fast & efficient.  Plenty of deck chairs everywhere. Main pools a little crowded on sailing days.  Be careful to keep balcony door closed and handle down, or A/C turns off.  Took ship tour last day- fascinating in galleys, laundry, dining rooms, bridge, etc.
5.0	Sail Date: Jun 10, 2018 /	Great ship. Our first time on an Oasis class ship. Never felt like there were over 6000 guests on board except at the Windjammer Cafe. Turned away twice at breakfast. Not much variety compared to the anthem of the Seas. Also getting two chairs together by a pool can be tough unless you go early on sea days. Make your show reservations early though. The shows were never full but without a reservation you have to wait until 10 minutes before the show starts to get in. Never once felt the ship move while at sea. Smoothest cruise we have ever been on. Also had the quickest time getting on and off the ship we have ever experienced. Not sure what they do different but it works. Can’t wait to go on an Oasis class ship again.
4.8	Sail Date: Jun 10, 2018 /	Great cruise entertainment was top shelf especially the band Temperature
4.9	Sail Date: Jun 10, 2018 /	"Overall great weather; amazing ship; amazing entertainment and shows on ship; very good food on ship. Waited until last night to try Flow Rider. Wish we would have done it sooner.  Everything crowded on ""at Sea"" days. Many times had to wait for several elevators when everyone was on ship. Ice Cream cones: at Wipeout Cafe AND on Deck 15 near pools, half of the time when we went for ice cream cones they were either out of cones or refilling the mix. Two of our 3 staterooms (6682 & 6684) did not have good working A/C.  Cruise ship employees insisted we shut off main power switch or were leaving balcony door open. Finally after 4th complaint (and 5 nights poor sleep because of heat & humidity) they discovered the problem and fixed it in 6684. Then on the last morning maintenance workers were on our balcony at 6:30 am (6684) making a lot of noise. Then at 7:40 am a maintenance worker came to our door and said they needed us to leave so they could work on our room and balcony.  Toilet seat surface (6700) seemed like it wasn't white like rest of toilet. Seemed like a dingy color (from human contact).  I think it needs a Brillo pad or similar to bring it back to a brilliant white."
4.7	Sail Date: Jun 10, 2018 /	This was our 20th anniversary cruise.  It was amazing.  This ship is truly a marvel and a must see.  You can see pictures and videos but unless you experience it for yourself, you are missing out.  The staff was wonderful. Always smiling.  Our wait staff was amazing.  We had My Time Dining but 6 out of the 7 nights we had the same wait staff.  The one night we did not have them, we made sure that we requested them for the rest of the cruise and they met our request.
5.0	Sail Date: Jun 03, 2018 /	We loved sailing on Oasis. Everything was wonderful. If we didn’t like what was on the menu in the main dinning room, we ate elsewhere. The only thing I would change is the length of the cruise. There is just too much to do in a week, I need at least 10 days not 7.  Can’t wait to go again.
4.5	Sail Date: Jun 03, 2018 /	What a fabulous week. Although Oasis of the Seas was looking a little tired, the ship was still incredible with the amount of entertainment onboard. We had a large group, 14 total, and there was never a time that anyone said they couldn’t find something to do. Everyone had a great week, we made mamy memories, laughed a lot, and will be cruising again and again on Royal Caribbean.
4.6	Sail Date: Jun 03, 2018 /	If you are not happy on Oasis, maybe cruising isn't for you.  There is literally something for everyone, and the staff go out of their way to ensure a great time!
5.0	Sail Date: Jun 03, 2018 /	Our family group of 10 included our daughters, sons-in-law and grandchildren, ages 12-25.  We all had a fantastic time.  There were activities for every age group and interests.  The dining staff went above and beyond to provide delicious choices for the two vegan members of the family.  We could not have been more pleased with our cruise.
3.2	Sail Date: Jun 03, 2018 /	I was very excited to sail on RCI Oasis. I have to say that it was just okay. I wasn’t overly impressed. Some staff were great, but overall they lacked enthusiasm and commitment to the customers. Many times it was hard to get a drink. Dinner took 2 hours in the MDR and the service there was very lacking. I often had to ask for a steak knife for my steak or lamb. They got drinks wrong or wouldn’t bring things that were requested. Coke machines were out of ice every time I used it. Windjammer surpasses my expectations. Food was great and staff there was very friendly. Overall I was unimpressed. It wasn’t bad, but it wasn’t anything I would be overly excited to book again.
5.0	Sail Date: Jun 03, 2018 /	"First Royal Caribbean cruise on the Oasis and we loved it! Amazed at all the activities and things to do, loved our itinerary and had great service experiences. Would definitely do it all over again. 
It is what you make it to be not what anyone else tells you it should be!!"
4.9	Sail Date: Jun 03, 2018 /	Getting on and off was very easy this time around.  Ship is beautiful staff friendly, and attentive food excellent. Will miss the Oasis of the Seas.
5.0	Sail Date: Jun 03, 2018 /	Cabin! Read post about dirty carpet and couch. Our deck and room was nice and clean. No stained carpet or couch. Rm 9710. Was very nice and comfortable.
4.7	Sail Date: Jun 03, 2018 /	Wait staff at dinner was excellent!!!!!  Room attendant was excellent!!!!  Love San Juan and Labadee !!!!
4.8	Sail Date: Jun 03, 2018 /	The ship is huge stay in the middle of the ship. The buffet is ok, the steakhouse is ok I would not spend the money to way there. Enjoy the boardwalk area in the evenings.
5.0	Sail Date: Jun 03, 2018 /	"This ship is amazing! Plenty of activities on board. It never seemed as if there were 6900 people on board. 

Pros: The WiFi is exceptional in comparison to the service we had on the Carnival Fantasy. 

The Freestyle machines was a plus. It was nice to have different fountain drink choices. When we cruised on the Carnival Fantasy the soda was always flat because they would pour from a can that had been sitting open. It was nice to have a fresh soda on Oasis!

The staff was friendly and helpful. I enjoyed the food in the Windjammer Marketplace. We pretty much ate there and Sorrentos everyday. Sorrentos was very good pizza. We never ate in the main dining room so I can’t speak about it.

The shows that we did see were amazing. 
We did not see CATS but a lot of people said they didn’t like it.

Cons: One breakfast there was a huge egg shell in the scrambled eggs. I understand that they prepare the food quickly but eating egg shell for breakfast is not my favorite! 

Ice was a challenge in the Freestyle machines, especially the first couple of days. They only had one Freestyle machine working on the Promenade deck (5), which in my opinion was where the most traffic was; however, there was two in Windjammer. 

Overall we had an excellent experience and will do Oasis again!"
4.0	Sail Date: Jun 03, 2018 /	This was our first “large ship class” cruise. I don’t think I’d go on another - I’ll stick to the smaller ships in the future. The rooms were small for such a large ship. I didn’t like having to book reservations way in advance for the shows - I’d rather not feel like I’m on a set schedule while on vacation. However, most of the attendants were friendly and helpful! Overall, great cruise - just not my cup of tea!
4.8	Sail Date: Jun 03, 2018 /	Great Cruise.  St. Maarten was still pretty messed up by the Hurricane.  But PR was amazing!
4.5	Sail Date: May 27, 2018 /	Awesome way to spend time with family. Fun in the sun and an awesome night life atmosphere. There is something to do for everyone!
3.6	Sail Date: May 27, 2018 /	Enjoyed the cruise but the ship was very tired. Frayed curtains in our room, room not as big or as nice as it looked in the pictures. The carpet was dirty, we got at least a dozen towel that the edges were torn and hanging. Dining tables not cleared or wiped. At windjammer they kept running out of stuff like fries and watermelon and took forever to refill them.Hall carpets dirty and frayed. Hall carpets not vacuumed it was three days that a black piece of plastic laid on the floor before they picked it up. On a positive note the staff was very friendly. Thought Labadee was very nice,enjoyed the Mayan ruins except for the people trying to sell you stuff, disappointed in essence of Montego Bay. I wish they would clean the balcony glass so when you sit on a chair you can see through it. Wish Cat's would not have had technical difficulty and finished.
5.0	Sail Date: May 27, 2018 /	1st cruise and wow was i spoiled! Only felt crowded a few times waiting on the elevators. Staff was incredible. So much to see and do - don't think we covered it all. Loved taking coffee out on deck 16 to watch the sunsets.
5.0	Sail Date: May 20, 2018 /	"Just got married on this ship in May and LOVED it! Now one of my new favorite ships (along with freedom OTS). 

plenty of entertainment and activities for everyone, food was delicious, bar and dining service was excellent and the room steward was the BEST we’ve ever had! Very clean and beautiful ship, super friendly & helpful staff. We did the Eastern Caribbean with stops in St Maarten, Puerto Rico and Labadee Haiti. 

***If you are sailing on Oasis in the future- book shows ahead of time! One mistake we made by not doing so —luckily we were still able to join in after guests with pre made reservations were seated. 

Also,If you are considering a cruise wedding- HIGHLY RECOMMEND!! Planning was super easy, fun, stress free and enjoyable. Our special day turned out perfect and were definitely treated like “royalty”. :)"
4.0	Sail Date: May 20, 2018 /	First Royal cruise we went on. Absolutely loved the ship. There was so much to do we had trouble choosing. The food was alright, and we did the my choice dinner which was inconsistent with quality of service since you are sat anywhere. Potentially recommend having one time so you get to know your serving staff. It is a massive ship, and we do plan to continue with Royal in the future. Go book your next cruise while on the ship, it’ll be a lot less expensive.
5.0	Sail Date: May 20, 2018 /	Awesome cruise all amenities were awesome next cruise desk was very helpful in booking our next cruise in September on Anthem to New England and Nova Scotia and New Brunswick
4.2	Sail Date: May 20, 2018 /	Great ship! Great staff!  Great itinerary!!  Wished San Juan was longer!!  Loved the behind the scenes tour and would sail this ship again in a minute!!
4.9	Sail Date: May 20, 2018 /	It's continued in my night dreams! In future l have to take other cruise!
4.8	Sail Date: May 20, 2018 /	We had an awesome time. My favorite port was St Martens. The staff was amazing. Can't wait to go again!!!
5.0	Sail Date: May 20, 2018 /	First time on this ship, all I can say is I loved the whole experience.  There was so much to do, there is no way you can do everything on just one cruise. Even though the ship has over 6,000 people on board, it never felt crowded. The crew were all very friendly, would help anyway they could.
5.0	Sail Date: May 20, 2018 /	Huge ship with everything you could imagine on it. The staff is very eager to please. Food was decent and plenty of it! Never felt crowded even with 6000 passengers on it. Staff was also always cleaning! Only complaint I'd have is the Nasty couch cushion in our cabin, other than that I'd definitely say this is a very nice clean ship.
4.9	Sail Date: May 20, 2018 /	Love Royal Caribbean cruise line. So many food options. I definitely over ate. Slept like a baby every night. Awesome service. Very relaxing. Can’t wait till my next cruise.
5.0	Sail Date: May 20, 2018 /	Our 5th cruise and awesome. All staff was extremely helpful and smiled. The ship was easy to get around, we used the stairs frequently as the elevators were at times slow and packed which was fine due to all the awesome food we were eating. The casino was less Smokey in the morning. Our cabin jr.suite was great plenty of room .
4.9	Sail Date: May 20, 2018 /	"Husband and I decided to celebrate our 10 year wedding Anniversary on Oasis of the Sea along with his Brother and his Girlfriend. We had never cruised before and was a bit nervous about being on a mega ship for our first cruise experience. Overall we had a great time and soon realized that we had been missing out all these years not cruising.  Even though it did feel crowded most times, it did not bother us at all because we were having fun! 

The food was delicious and we ate alot during our entire stay. We tried 3 of the specialty restaurants; Izumi hibachi experience , Chops Grille and Sabor. Izumi was nice but I didn't like how we were packed at one hibachi table with other guests. I felt like I couldn't really extend my arms out to eat comfortably and the sushi was nothing really special.  

The shows were awesome but due to weather we were not able to see all of the Oasis of Dreams show and heard Cats was not so great, so we skipped on that show. We loved Frozen in Time and the Comedy show. 

The only real compliant I would have is that both Hubby and I felt that our room was HOT! We had the AC on all the time and it just really was never cool in our rooms. Luckily we brought mini battery operated fans to use while sleeping but it still was a tad bit warm for us. 

We loved this cruise so much, we already booked our next cruise on Symphony of the Sea Oct 2019 !"
5.0	Sail Date: May 20, 2018 /	This was a phenomenal and utterly relaxing cruise! The staff went above and beyond to make us feel welcome and appreciated. This was our first time back on an oasis class in a little over a year. (Our 7th time on that class overall) In our opinion the food at the buffet (lunch/dinner) has improved. They got rid of some of tired items and replaced them with better choices. Service in Chops was the best we have ever had! We in fact went back three days later and our waiter from before remembered our names and sent over drinks. The ship is big yes, but it’s not hard to avoid areas at peak times and still thoroughly enjoy every aspect of the ship. We have tried other cruise lines but there is a reason we always come back to RC.
3.0	Sail Date: May 20, 2018 /	"First yes the ship looks amazing and the room was nice. Ports were great. 
Second: did not feel welcome on the ship. Crew did not seem to be happy on the ship. Maybe 1 in 5 crew seemed to enjoy being there and enteracting with guests. Several time crew just ignored or walked away when asked something. 
Third: entertanment, acts themselfs were good. But waiting to do anything was a joke. First cruise I have ever been on you had to reserve shows 3 month in advance. We bought out ticket 1 month so only had show on the last day. So had 6 day to do nothing we were paying for. 
Fourth: Food, we did not have one hot meal on the ship. Dinning room food was presentable but cold and little flavor. Buffets food was not appealing, both over and under cooked. If I asked to have something made a certain way, was look at like I'm crazy or was told ok and then didnt get it that way. Pizza and the park cafe had good food. 
I would not recommend RC Oasis and I am not sure if I will ever sail with RC again. This trip was to test the waters with this cruise line and they failed big time.
I hope this info is usefull and will allow for other guests to enjoy there trips."
4.2	Sail Date: May 20, 2018 /	We deserve a refund on our soda card their were machines but only 1 worked
4.6	Sail Date: May 13, 2018 /	All services and food were excellent.  The shows were also well done -especially the comedy show.  Every crew member we came in contact with was friendly and helpful. Ship never felt crowded.  Only complaint - the lack of organization for handling reservations lines and non-reservation line at the shows.  Recommend a sign identifying the two lines be place out at least one hour before the show and have a crew member there to handle the confusion.    That was the only thing we saw poorly handled during the cruise, (especially the aqua show and the comedy show.
5.0	Sail Date: May 13, 2018 /	This was our second cruise with RCI. We are by no means seasoned travelers but the Oasis of The Seas was easy to navigate and because of its enormous size we never felt crowded.
4.7	Sail Date: May 13, 2018 /	This was my grandsons first cruise. Ages 3 & 5. They had a great time, as all the people in our party did. My second time on the Oasis and enjoyed as much as I did 9 years ago. I have booked the Harmony of the Seas for February 2019. Looking forward to that.
5.0	Sail Date: May 13, 2018 /	This was our 8th cruise and our very favorite. Adult Solarium was amazing and never felt crowded. Balcony and room was larger than any Carnival ship. Ship was easy to get around on and never felt crowded. Staff was always very nice and helpful. Loved my time timing and Remi is the best head waiter ever. Would definitely sail on this ship again. We loved the ship so much we opted to stay on board in 2 ports.
4.7	Sail Date: May 13, 2018 /	Weather was not conducive to spending copious amounts of time outdoors but there were so many activities to keep us occupied that it didn't matter
5.0	Sail Date: May 13, 2018 /	I loved my cruise  I have to give a big shout out to my house keeper !!! He went out and beyond to keep my room clean I did appreciated that. 100%   boat everywhere was clean !!!  Love the fact there was hand sanitizer everywere! I have nothing to say just keep up the great work!!
4.9	Sail Date: May 13, 2018 /	We love the Eastern Caribbean stops. St. Thomas and St. Maarten are so nice and friendly. Great places to buy jewelry, especially since you don't pay tax.
4.3	Sail Date: May 13, 2018 /	Oasis is a beautiful ship!! Lots to see and do!! Can't wait for the next one!!
5.0	Sail Date: May 13, 2018 /	It was a relaxing cruise, my younger son loved the Flow rider. Very much enjoy this adventure.
4.0	Sail Date: May 13, 2018 /	We enjoyed our first mega ship experience but I am not sure we will cruise on another one in the future. It turns out we prefer the more intimate ezperience of a smaller ship.  The spaces were beautiful, the entertainment was fabulous, and the crew was great. I especially enjoyed the  central park area and the park cafe. Our room was on the same deck so it was nice to walk through central park instead of a long hallway to get to our room. I didnt like the fact that I had to hunt for an ocean view since we opted for an inside room on this cruise. While I enjoyed the cruise and am glad we did it, I may stick to smaller class ships in the future.
4.0	Sail Date: May 13, 2018 /	Definetly a grand ship, though a bit too large. Also, i really didn't like the overall mood onboard. Kind of oldish. Also the food was amazing, there just weren't that many choices, most restaurants are not included in the price all though you pay a heavy price to cruise on this ship. LOVED the venues onboard, central park being my favorite. Good sided cabin, though the bed's on the wrong side.
5.0	Sail Date: May 13, 2018 /	This was a beautiful ship. Was our first experience cruising and it didn’t fall short of amazing. Never felt crowed, and the ship was sold out. Food was amazing. You have to try the Italian restaurant. All of the staff was attentive and always friendly. Can’t wait till our next cruise
5.0	Sail Date: May 13, 2018 /	Our next cruise in mid-May will be the third time we have cruised on the Oasis of the Seas. She is a beautiful ship and the crew is always very attentive. 🚢😎🛳
4.0	Sail Date: May 06, 2018 /	My family and I just got off the Oasis of the Seas on 5/13/18. The ship is beautiful and most of the staff are great... however, their guest services need some serious attention. Our bathroom flooded from an overflowing toilet while one of my daughters was in the shower. She opened the door to find toilet water flowing out so fast it was overwhelming the floor drain. Maintenance came in and they needed a plumber to replace a valve. It was fixed and cleaned up. When I went to guest services to complain about this( I spent a lot of $$$ for this cruise) I asked about some onboard credit for the inconvenience. They said no, the best they could do was chocolate covered strawberries..😞. I begrudgingly agreed. I asked that they be delivered on Sat, our last sea day. By dinner, they hadn’t come so my daughter went down to guest services Again and complained and they apologized and said they’d send them right up. Needless to say, they never arrived. It’s a shame that a great trip like this had to end in such a sour note. I understand things happen which are out of their control, but they need to do a better job of taking care of their customers.
5.0	Sail Date: May 06, 2018 /	Enjoyed the Oasis so much, food was great. Entertainment was awesome, staff was very friendly and helpful. Only thing I missed compared to the smaller ships is the ocean views. All the bars are on the inside of the ship so not able to get a drink and watch the ocean without being on the top decks
4.7	Sail Date: May 06, 2018 /	We had a wonderful time on Oasis of the Seas.  Love the adults only section on the front of the ship.  The shows were amazing.  Dazzles nightclub on deck 8 was fantastic.  We also LOVED Central Park.  There is something for everyone on this ship.  Looking forward to my next cruise.
5.0	Sail Date: May 06, 2018 /	Oasis and Allure will always be my top two favs in Royal Caribbean's fleet. And that's after sailing on their newer ships.  Just got off an Oasis sailing May 6-May 13. As before, she never disappoints! All of the staff were attentive and provided excellent service. Food was great! Plenty of options! Omg the salmon and asparagus they serve on the room service menu was sooo delicious! Seasoned and cooked to perfection! The ship was in great condition!  No complaints regarding the cabin! Lots of options for entertainment for all ages and taste. My 13 yr old loved the teen club and was there for most of the cruise. The ship is big and beautiful!  As others have mentioned, even though there are five thousand or so other ppl on the ship, it never feels like it. Never once felt crowded. Always comfortable.  Can't wait for the next cruise or Oasis or Allure since they are identical ships!
4.7	Sail Date: May 06, 2018 /	Ship is wonderful, entertainment is amazing, food and coffee is underwhelming at best.
2.6	Sail Date: May 06, 2018 /	I had a drink package and still charged for drinks. Got food poison from my excursion. Payed for a show on the ship back stage tour. Never received it.
4.0	Sail Date: May 06, 2018 /	"Just got off the Oasis of the Seas, May 14th. This was my first time on RCCL, and first time on the Oasis class ships. I must say I truly impressed with the design of the ship!! It is HUGE and impressive to say the least!! Fot a ship carrying almpst 6,000 passengers, it only felt crowded in a few areas, and only when there were special events going on like the Promenade during formal night with all the photos spots and special disco activities on promenade.
Having cruised many times with Carnival and a transatlantic with Norwegian, it was interesting now to see how RC compares with the other two big players.  Ill offer my own perceptions on that later. But the readers digest version is:
Pros: HUGE impressive well designed ship, decent size well decorated ocean balcony cabin, VERY nice deep balcony, comfee bed, glass shower door, decent food (not the best, but decent), good service, friendly staff for the most part, lots to see and do!! Embarkation and Dis-embarkation was always smooth and speedy!! A+ for Oasis on how they moved people on and off the ship!! 

Cons: HORRIBLE buffet design!!! The Wind Jammer buffet was mostly chaotic no matter what time you got there, wasnt open very many hrs, too jammed seating making it hard to walk around, the oval buffet food stations SUCKED to see what was the flow of traffic or even what all was available. Also, the way they placed food made zero sense... like salad dressing not withe the salads, sour cream not with baked potatoes, common food pairings not together, no access to drink stations.... they had waiters filling glasses to grab, but couldnt fill your own cup... and they disnt have enough seating daily, so there was a wait line to get a table many times. AND... you couldnt just walk in to make a plate to take back to your cabin!! Piss-Poor design. Not enough indoor activities when the weather is raining, terrible tv channels, outdoor movies needed better sound and they needed to lower the other lights to see the screens better. During the first big movie ""Black Panther"", they decided to clean the Aqua theater pool during the movie... WTF??? Another BIG con is not enough drink stations... luckily we had the drink package so I could get bottled water at any bar, but if not, you would be screwed to get anything to drink as all buffets were only open short hrs and not much options for free drinks elsewhere."
5.0	Sail Date: May 06, 2018 /	My first time on this ship and I enjoyed myself up until 3:00am right before disembarkation. I woke up with the norovirus. Luckily I only had a 2.5 hr drive home from the port. Besides that I had a great time. I even went to On-Air for karaoke. That was fun..
5.0	Sail Date: May 06, 2018 /	Just enjoyed a 7 day cruise on this beautiful ship!! Staff were very friendly. Room Attendant Romeo super nice and did a great job!! Enjoyed my time dining with our head waiter Puntu Juin on Deck 4. Clean ship!
5.0	Sail Date: May 06, 2018 /	"I cruised on May 6th. Must say that I was really impressed with the Oasis. All my past cruises were on Carnival. Wanted to experience a bigger ship, so Oasis was it. I thought with the amount of cruisers that it would be overly crowded. But it wasn’t. Experienced a long line when we first boarded at the Windjammers (expected). But that was it for food anyway. The food at Windjammers was very good. Wish they made omelette’s vice going down to Wipeout (another eatery). But I was able to manage with all the food that was there.🤗 Service was great! The MDR wasn’t as good, only because the menu didn’t change much from day to day. However the service was spot on. Didn’t utilize any specialty restaurants. 
The shows and entertainment were very good. The lines to the shows can get very long, very early. But I was usually at the front, so no problem there and the lines moved quickly . They open up from 30-45 minutes prior. 
Was always able to find a lounge chair on deck. The 70’s show was very good, my wife said the Quest show was wild!😂
Long line for embarkation, but moved very fast. Self assist for debarkation and was off the ship and through customs in 15 minutes. 
Overall it was a very good cruise and am very impressed with RCCL and the Oasis. I have booked a cruised for the Symphony in April 2020. Still a Carnival fan too. Guess I just love cruising. It’s truly what you make it. Enjoy your future cruising."
5.0	Sail Date: Apr 29, 2018 /	This ship was totally worth the cost and so was saying in a suite because the rooms are larger than balcony, ocean view. And interior cabins. Lots more entertainment then the enchantment. I will differently book an Oasis class ship and possible a suite just because of the amount of room that a suite has compared to other cabins
5.0	Sail Date: Apr 29, 2018 /	"First time on Oasis of the seas and was a little nervous being so many people on board this ship, But this ship is huge and to my surprise never felt crowed. 
1- Embarking was a breeze being priority check in as star class we were treated very well. From the time I parked the car and meet my host at the elevator on the first floor along with my bags, we were whisked through security and met my Genie, got our picture taken and in our suite in less than 30 min with our bags sitting in our room. Incredible!!   Had a briefing on our room and everything we asked for was in place. we were unpacked and everything in it place by 1pm
2-  2nd day at sea so we did a show and toured the ship, Ate dinner at Chops and hung out at the boardwalk, very fun place for us. loved Sabors
3- Labadee, we rented a cabana over the water and snorkeled for the most part, our attendant was awesome and kept the drinks flowing. all i asked for was good island type drinks and  tipped him well. had a Great time with the wife
4- Falmouth Jamaica we stayed on board the ship, did a spa visit and bridge tour. Had dinner Chops again, very nice place to eat. Later that night we did a show and the prohibition event,  Had an Awesome Time! We dressed up in our 20's outfit and live it up 1920 style with live jazz music and lots of alcohol drinks and nibble food. 
5- Sea day so we gambled a bit did another show, shopped on board, relax a bit
6- Cozumel, we rented our own private boat for a snorkel trip and had a freaking Blast. The 33' boston whaler was perfect for us, fed us with nibble food, did a few shot of tequila,  had an amazing time!
7- Sea day, still trying to learn the ship, all the ins and outs pack up our stuff and could not believe it was almost over, Time just flew by. The only thing as far as our cabin goes, which was huge is if you want more privacy do the 1718 instead of the 1720. but really wasn't a problem with us but again very big cabin with lots of space.  2 Full bath and a shower to die for. We were treated extremely well and well worth the cost..."
5.0	Sail Date: Apr 29, 2018 /	"We just got off our cruise on Oasis on May 6. Both my wife and I agree that it was the best vacation that we have ever had! So here’s our review (Be warned, its long).I can’t say enough good things about the ship and crew. Everyone from the time we got on til we got off, treated us with much kindness. Embarkation went extremely smooth. We were impressed with the way RC handled everyone. We boarded the ship at 1130 and had drinks in hand by 1145. She and I decided to eat at the Solarium Bistro for lunch. We were one of the first to eat there. I suggest that you consider doing that  if you take this cruise. There were no crowds. Our room was 9532. It was ready by 1. It was an ocean view balcony on the Starboard side of the ship. The room was not huge but sufficient. Our luggage arrived quickly with the exception of one. We went ahead and unpacked and then went and explored the ship. I would check back occasionally to see if the last bag had made up to our cabin. We did the required Muster Drill. It was nice to not have to line up in life jackets on deck 5. Our gathering point was the Opal Theater. Nice and air conditioned! We left Port Canaveral on time on a beautiful Sunday afternoon. We stood on the Lido deck as the ship departed and enjoyed the sail away party. Afterwards she and I thought we could try the MDR for the first night. 
We were seated in the Silk Dining room. However there was a mix up and we were going to have to be seated with a large party of people we did not really want to sit with. We were seated at a table for 2 but just for that night. We were told by one of the head waiters, Iben that we would have to sit with the original table the rest of the cruise. My wife asked if there would be any way if we could keep the table for 2 the rest of the week. Iben came through for us and accommodated us every night. We both felt he went above and beyond. The only negative if there is one we had different wait staff every two nights. None of the wait staff missed a beat.   Each night the staff was speedy and conscientious. Every night we went away satisfied and very impressed with the food and delivery. The last night Iben and staff celebrated my wife’s 50th birthday with song, cake and champagne. She felt so special.
We had room service every morning with coffee and enjoyed on the balcony. 
For breakfast, we ended up at Park Cafe . It never was crowded and we liked eating in Central Park. 
We were greeted every morning by our cabin Stewart Karen. Every time we saw her she always asked what we were doing today. She was so kind and took very good care of us. The room was always clean. I asked for ice one time and I had ice in our room Twice a day for the rest of the cruise. 
Oasis is definitely a big ship. 5500 passengers 2200 crew. We never felt really crowded. Maybe on the Lido deck on days at sea but it wasn’t that bad. Our experience with the bar staff was very good. I had read reviews that they were nonexistent. We did not experience that at all. We had purchased the deluxe drink package before we got on board. Jose, Kirk and many others kept us happy. 
The food overall was good.  The wife and I are not foodies.We ate at the Windjammer a couple times for lunch. To us it was good and had a large selection. The staff cleaned tables promptly and would get you drinks. We also saw them serving cookies and ice cream. We did not do any specialty dining. Sorrentos is really good pizza. Solarium Bistro tends to have healthier food choices. Did not eat at Johnny Rockets. 
I had also read some reviews that the ship was not clean and worn out. Again, my observation was the opposite. I noticed some type maintenance was always going on. Someone was always wiping down all surfaces. We had a minor problem with a piece of metal sticking out in our room. I asked Karen if she could get the maintenance crew to look at it. It was promptly fixed. There is some minor wear and tear but nothing that would ruin your cruise. Oasis is scheduled for dry dock in April 2019.

We enjoyed Labadee. It was hot but the beach is nice. We did do the Zip Line there. We had a great time doing it!
At Falmouth Jamaica, we just got off the ship and walked around the shopping area right there by the dock. We did not do an excursion.
At Cozumel we had planned on doing the same thing. Somehow we made our way into Senor Frogs. 1 liter of Tecate and 2 shots of Don Julio Tequila, it was time to go back to the ship. Somehow along the way back to the ship I bought a nice little carribean topaz ring for the wife. I thought I was done but again somehow I ended up with a pair of bullfrog skin cowboy boots as well.I’m still trying to figure out how that happened. Finally made back to the ship and spent the rest of the day relaxing by the pool. Yeah I know they got us in Cozumel, but she and I had a blast! It will always be a story to tell.
Last day at sea was nice. Everyone again headed to the lido deck for the pool. We were treated with a fly by of 2 F-16s . That was kinda cool. Yes many people reserve their deck chairs. No they are not supposed to. I did not see them enforce the no reserve policy. 
 I guess the thing I really like about the ship was there was always something to do if you wanted to do it. The shows were good. We did go to Cats. Ahhhh I’m just not into the Broadway thing. Nothing against the cast. I think they did a good job but I’m not into that. Come fly with me was good. We did enjoy it. Great performance. The ABBA tribute band was good. Aqua theatre performance was Excellent! The comedy acts were good as well.
One thing I was interested in was taking a behind the scenes tour of the ship. I had booked that excursion also before we left. Wow!! I was really impressed with what goes on behind the scenes. The Galley, the food lockers and freezer, the beer, wine and liquor. I was blown away with how much food and drink it takes for one cruise. The  engine control room , the I 95 corridor, the laundry room and the bridge were something to see.
 Disembarkation was very easy and organized. We chose to do self assist and we were off the ship by 730 and on the road back to Atlanta by 800. 
  We have already booked another cruise on Oasis for July 2019 it will be doing the Western Mediterranean . We are looking forward to it already."
4.6	Sail Date: Apr 29, 2018 /	It was Great. Food was good. Drinks were good but Expensive and had a lot of grounds in my coffee at the windjammer.
5.0	Sail Date: Apr 29, 2018 /	We had a great time, and booked our next cruise on the Harmony.
5.0	Sail Date: Apr 29, 2018 /	Oasis is a wonderful ship with lots to do and even sailing on it multiple times you still have new things to see.
5.0	Sail Date: Apr 29, 2018 /	"Just got off Oasis (2nd time on this ship) we love this ship. Central Park is beautiful and it literally feels like a park. We stayed in a balcony overlooking Boardwalk, we loved the continuous activity there. Room was clean, and our attendant was very nice. This time we also tried 2 specialty restaurants, Izumi and Giovanni. Both were fun and delicious! Would do it again.
And no complaints here as far as the main dining room either. 
Windjammer gets a bit too crowded for us so for breakfast we like WipeOut, or Central Park Cafe or Johnny Rockets (breakfast is free there)
As far as entertainment, the ice show was my favorite! Very professional and beautiful. The Headliner show was awesome too and yes it’s best to reserve your seat.
The pools do get a bit crowded, but what can you do about that? It’s hot and everyone wants to get in the pool but there’s several to choose from.
So many eateries and bars all over the ship so it’s easy to get away from the crowds.
To those negative reviews I say, there’s so much to see and do that in my opinion if you don’t have fun then it’s your own fault, and probably cruising just isn’t your thing."
5.0	Sail Date: Apr 29, 2018 /	Just off the Oasis today. 1st time on Oasis . Had an awesome time.  Everything was great !!!! Went to the shows we had reserved just arrive early !!!!
4.0	Sail Date: Apr 22, 2018 /	We had a wonderful time together out at sea. We try to make the most out of everything so we didn't let the little things bother us. We will probably try another company next time or a different ship.
4.0	Sail Date: Apr 22, 2018 /	Super clean ship, very attentive staff, excellent food, and the dining services team is top notch! If you want a large cruise ship experience that will leave you feeling pampered and full of joy, then you can't go wrong choosing Royal Caribbean Oasis of the Seas!
4.5	Sail Date: Apr 22, 2018 /	First full cruise and to sum it up already looking into Next year’s cruise had an awesome time can’t wait to go again. Traveled with my young granddaughter four years old and really researched their kids program after the first day she was in love and reviews you read about your kids not wanting to come out ate absolutely true she had options to do other things and all she wanted to do was go to the kids club an absolutely fabulous program
4.6	Sail Date: Apr 22, 2018 /	"Overall, I and my hubby had a great time!! Oasis of the sea we will never forget and most of all the various lovely food and fresh fruits everything were soo~ wonderful.💖  
Beautiful ship!!!"
4.8	Sail Date: Apr 22, 2018 /	This was our first cruise,  will definitely be cruising again.
4.9	Sail Date: Apr 22, 2018 /	Kristopher our waiter and Marcus our room attendant were AWESOME!!
4.5	Sail Date: Apr 22, 2018 /	over all We would definitely sail on the Oasis on a different  cruise. Until the Eastern Caribbean recovers from the damage Irma left behind I would not recommend this journey.  Dr Arun in the Spa acupuncturist was awesome. He helped my husband manage his pain to a mere discomfort.  Our cabin steward Alex was awesome.
4.0	Sail Date: Apr 22, 2018 /	We had a fantastic time on the Oasis!! Even though there was 6000 people on the ship I never really noticed. It didn’t feel crowded at all, the lines for food were shorter and faster than our previous cruise on a 2300 passenger ship. The elevators were quick, I don’t remember waiting more than a minute or two and that was mostly dinner time with the aft elevators closest to the dining room. Dinner in the dining room was good! We tried the windjammer buffet the first two nights but the last five we ate in the dining room because it was much better. The buffets were... well... buffets. Not great, not horrible, just average. The bars and drinks were good, I sometimes wonder about the liquor content thou, after 6/7 drinks I should of been feeling pretty good and I wasn’t. Entertainment was great! Now some have complained about the lines... well the seating is limited and there are 6000+ people on the ship so I recommend making reservations before. If you want to just wait and see well... 200 seats, 6000 people, do the math. People who complain are stupid and don’t prepare properly.  They offer shampoo but no soap except little bars. Any questions just send me a message! I got pictures and even planners for every day!
4.5	Sail Date: Apr 22, 2018 /	Over all had a wonderful time, look forward to our next cruise on the Harmony of the Seas next year.
4.9	Sail Date: Apr 22, 2018 /	This cruise was a celebration of the end of my breast cancer treatment journey.  Having only one chemo left, it gave me time to forget about my journey, to reflect and allowed me to be myself again ....to love life and second chances.  Thank you Oasis of the Seas!.
4.0	Sail Date: Apr 22, 2018 /	"Overall,  cruise was very good.   It is 9 years old and showing wear and tear but they do a pretty good job of keeping it clean. Sofa and carpet showing lots of wear.   Beds are hard but ask for an egg crate and they will provide. Tried the specialty dining and Chops was amazing.   Sabor and Giavonni's not so good.   Park Cafe beef sandwiches the best.   Pizza not so good.   Ate breakfast one morning in Windjammer and it was good.   Was really happy with the nights we did Anytime Dining... Food was really good/service exceptional.   Wasted $35 pp on the seaday galley tour/ brunch... Short tour and brunch was just so-so.   
Shows were great... CATS was long but I loved it.....make sure you read up on the storyline before you go. Comedians and other shows were great! 
Ports were lovely.. Labadee beautiful.. No tenders.. Yay! St Maarten.. Did the Rhino snorkeling tour.. Amazing!   
Puerto Rico.. Beautiful and nicely recovering from the hurricanes... The walk around the bottom of tge fort still closed.  
Days at Sea were filled with many activities if you are looking for something to do. 
Enjoyed the ships artwork at each staircase and loved looking for Small Wonders (Google it) 
No high pressure sales and minimal  load speaker announcements. 
Staff was hit and miss... Some very nice,  others rude.   CD Jeffrey Arpin is hysterical.. Captain Klaus a suoer nice guy and you can find him walking the decks!! 
BIG ship but pretty easy to get around... 1100 kids on-board.. Would be OK if parents had a little more control over their kids. 
Embark was a little longer due to coast guard inspection.   Disembark was a breeze... We carried luggage off and were in our car by 6:45 am. 
In summary... Great cruise for the price.. Pretty decent food for the number of people on-board.  I prefer a newer ship but she is grand!"
1.0	Sail Date: Apr 22, 2018 /	Lack of entertainment, long lines to see shows with people that pile in like Walmart on Black Friday, when the doors open they all rushed in at once. Roped off areas constantly, same old food day after day, reservations need to be made for shows otherwise you do not get to see your show because they are lacking entertainment to absorb the people that can’t get into the shows. Other cruise lines I’ve been on if you arrive to the show early you go in and seat yourself and wait for the show to begin as long as the room had been completely removed of all people first. Huge ship with narrow hallways and corridor’s with everybody tripping over each other most of the time. Everywhere you turn they are digging in your wallet rather than giving you some good entertainment that you’ve already paid for. Serious lack of souvenir shops, lots and lots of purses watches and hats for sale. Room service poor, at times I return to my room finding that bed covers have not even been changed and nothing picked up. The bed was the most uncomfortable distorted bed I’ve ever been in. I missed most of the shows because being in a wheelchair, when the doors open people piling in all around you to where you can’t get in. You find while standing in line for the show the person in front of you is holding a space for 20 to 30 other people in his or her group, A parent holding space for their children or another spouse is acceptable and understandable but not for a group of people that have met up on the ship. These long lines are everywhere you go in this ship,Long lines for shows that you can be in line waiting for as long as an hour, and if you don’t wait in line you will not get into see the show, long lines to get into the food establishments. A lot of food establishments charge you additional fees for food and there are only a few places that you can go to and get food without pulling your wallet out again.  This cruise line has really disappointed me and cruising with them five times I don’t think i’m cutting them short, I’ve been on the ships long enough to make a fair honest opinion. They flooded our state room in the past soaking all of our belongings, our options were to live with the wet floors or go to the second floor cabin next to the motors, they made us pay for the cleaning of our laundry but give us a $200 credit towards our next cruise which they did not honor when we decided to use it to Cruise again one and ahalf years later. On another cruise, booking us in a handicap room that was to accompany a wheelchair only to find out it did not accompany the wheelchair. We paid extra to be on a particular floor but since the screw up our options were to get off the ship or go to the second level of the ship and take a $80 credit towards our next cruise. It was one thing to walk all over us when we were kids taking our first and second cruises but now being older, retired and quite wealthy, this oasis cruise will be my last with Royal.  If you decide to cruise with this cruise line, I wish you the best and I hope you have a good time.
4.9	Sail Date: Apr 15, 2018 /	Overall it was a great experience. We love Royal Caribbean. The ship was gorgeous and the staff was awesome! We are planning already for next year an 11 night’s cruise. The one that visit Ponce Puerto Rico. We will like to recognize our stateroom attendant Iwayan. Since the first moment he memorize our names and always call us by our names. He was very cordial. We even make fun of the fact that it didn’t matter how many times we showed to our room, it seems he was waiting to open the door of our room!
2.9	Sail Date: Apr 15, 2018 /	As a single mom who had to save for over a year to afford this cruise I was very disappointed.  The food was horrible. The shows ok. I even went to the spa event and left with a facial purchase that broke my face out. Nevermind the fear of becoming ill. I had an okay time and fun moments but nothing I’ll be bragging on fb about unfortunately.
4.9	Sail Date: Apr 15, 2018 /	Overall a great relaxing cruise. The ship had lots to do if you wanted or you could relax and do nothing. I was happy that I went and will return one day.
5.0	Sail Date: Apr 15, 2018 /	Tons of fun... excellent for people with teen and children. None of us were ready to leave. Will sail again with Royal Caribbean.
4.7	Sail Date: Apr 15, 2018 /	Excellent cruise!!!!  The food was great, the service was great, the weather was perfect!  if you’re Looking for a relaxing time with nice sports this is the cruise for you.
5.0	Sail Date: Apr 15, 2018 /	This was our first RCCL cruise and we loved it!! The first night was very rocky going out of Port Canaveral but nobody can control the weather. Each day at sea was fun and all of the ports were great as well. Our room attendant Vincent was amazing! He knew our names and remembered them each time we saw him. He was always so pleasant and was always in a great mood. We only ate in the main dining room once on the first formal night. The food I ordered was nothing special, but was not terrible. We mostly ate at Windjammer and Izumi. Windjammer food was always good and Izumi was simply delicious! If you like sushi you definitely need to eat there! My husband was very impressed in the steak they had at windjammer as well. Every time he took it he said it was delicious. I have absolutely no complaints about the food. The comedy show was hysterical. The first comedian wasn’t that great but the headliner made up for it. We laughed all the way through. The aqua show was pretty good but a little slow for our taste. However, the divers/actresses are great at what they do. We also saw Come Fly with Me. That show was so good! My husband didn’t think he would enjoy it but he said it was great!  During the trip we got some bad news that a close family member had passed. We had already prepaid for a wine tasting event that afternoon but we didn’t make it due the news we received. I spoke to guest services on the last sea day and they credited our bill for the amount we had prepaid. They also offered me to use their emergency phone if I wanted to make any calls to family. I was very impressed with their customer service! We had to make an emergency stop in Nassau due to a guest being ill. That stop made us a couple hours late to arrive in Labadee but that just meant we got to sleep in a little later that morning. It was no big deal to us to have to make that additional stop and it showed how much RCCL cared about its guests safety. My husband and I did not get sick on the ship however we are germaphobes so we always always always wash our hands and sanitize. With so many people in one place you have to take the proper steps. All in all this was an amazing trip and we can’t wait to go back on Oasis. We have already booked for next January and we can’t wait! The countdown has begun. Only 265 days to go! We have been on Carnival in the past, and I won’t say I will never go back to a smaller ship, but I am very impressed and in awe of Oasis.
3.7	Sail Date: Apr 15, 2018 /	It was overall ok.  This was my first cruise so perhaps I expected too much as I heard the service and food was exceptional on Royal Caribbean.  I would compare it to staying at a Best Western for a week and eating at Denny's the entire time.  Nothing really wrong with either place but nothing to get excited about or jump at going back to.
3.4	Sail Date: Apr 15, 2018 /	We.do appreciate the experience and the dedication of the staff and have booked our third cruise!!
5.0	Sail Date: Apr 15, 2018 /	I loved all the staff they are so nice and caring. The entertainment bwas great. And the food was wonderful. I would recommend royal to anyone cruising!!
4.6	Sail Date: Apr 15, 2018 /	"Oasis of the Seas Western Caribbean Cruise 4/15-22/2018

OVERALL: I traveled with a group of 15 additional family and friends, and most had a wonderful time aboard this still beautiful ship. It was my first sailing on an Oasis class vessel, and I was impressed with the size and upkeep of this literal ‘floating city.’ She did show a few signs of wear, but overall, the look and feel of the ship is still classy. There are so many venues and things to do, it’s impossible to get it all in, so don’t even think about doing it in just 7 days! You have to pick your spots and go for it. If you have teenagers (13-17) the activities for them are truly outstanding, the girls in our group were always preparing for dances, parties, proms, and other activities. We rarely saw them around the ship except when it was food time! Sometimes  when we sat in the Royal Prominade, we’d forget we were on a ship. I’m not sure I loved that when I look back on it. I like feeling a constant connection with the ocean, which is the feeling I have when on some of the smaller classes of ship. 

FOOD: The overall quality of the food we received in the venues was very good, but in my opinion, it seemed to have come down a couple of notches from what I remember in cruises that I’ve taken over the past 3 to 20 years! The service in the MDR was outstanding for us, from the head waiter, Jason, who added our four late-comers to our table so we could all eat together, to Michelle and Amin, who served us so well. We felt like we had 3 new friends. We ate at Sabor, and the portions were HUUUUUGE! The quality was very good, but service was a little slow, and sometimes our server got stuff wrong. (I think it was a language barrier.) But he always served us with a smile! I’d go back! We had the Chops grille lunch. I got a 2.5 oz piece of filet! Never again! However, when my wife finally got her hamburger, it was one of the best she’d ever had! The service was pretty good, as was the flavor of the food. I will give them a try for dinner. We all enjoyed Johnny Rockets, as well as the Park Café! Those roast beef sandwiches more than lived up to advance billing! 

ENTERTAINMENT: We saw all the shows, except CATS! ALL WERE OUTSTANDING! I would see every one of them again in a heartbeat! The Dazzles nightclub was jumping most nights with the sounds of the Temperature band. They were really good, especially the lead singers. So versatile! The Quest game was crazy as usual! My only complaint here is they continue to ignore us baby boomers in the dance venues. Blaze often played music that appeals to us when they first open, but by 11:30, they stopped! All the music appealed to 18-25 year-olds! RCCL, you have a Latin dance club, Teen club, Jazz club, Karaoke club, Schooner bar music and even music in various spots throughout the ship. Why can’t there be an area or club where we hear dance music from the 60’s thru 90’s? Not a live band playing it…REAL RECORDED MUSIC that we remember! That’s all I have there! 

EXCURSIONS: We did the zip line in Labadee! What a rush! It’s a little overpriced, so catch a sale if you can and do it once! It’s worth it! We also walked all the way to Columbus cove. It’s the beach that’s the furthest distance from the ship, but there were less rocks and we enjoyed the water! In Falmouth, we did the Jamaica at leisure tour. We had a comfy air-conditioned bus, and an excellent tour of the area, did some shopping, albeit with pushy shop owners, and even had some Jamaican jerk chicken from a couple of local spots. We had a good time. 
Cozumel was our favorite stop. A couple friends and I climbed the Coba Pyramid. If you’ve booked this one, get ready for a workout. Walk a mile and a half after a 45 minute ferry ride to get there, then climb 123 feet at a 50-something degree angle to get to the top of the pyramid, then come back down! Wooooooooo! We were tired, but felt accomplished! In addition, we went down 60 feet to reach a deep swimming spot in a cave at Cenote’. This was a very nice and detailed tour which will give you the opportunity to work off all that food. 

FINAL THOUGHTS: This is still an excellent cruise and itinerary! I hardly felt like 6500 passengers were aboard this ship. It was almost always crowded at peak times in the Windjammer! The Solarium was a nice alternative to the outdoor pools and we enjoyed the whirlpool and pool at the adults only spot. Plan your activities daily as to not feel overwhelmed. We booked most of our entertainment on the cruise planner ahead of time, but many were still able get into entertainment on stand-by. Take it slow. Try other venues for breakfast, like room service, Johnny Rockets, MDR, Park café and Wipe out café. We had a great time, but with so many people, sometimes, I could see the wear and tear on the very ‘human’ staff. I was never treated rudely, but I certainly at times felt that I was just another “number.” I understand. I still love Royal Caribbean and enjoyed this massive and well-designed ship, Oasis of the seas!"
5.0	Sail Date: Apr 15, 2018 /	The cruise was perfect, lots of things to do, entertainment was fantastic, our room steward “Elvis” took great care of us, and our waiter staff at dinner was excellent from the Mait tre d  to the assistant waiter, a special thanks to Ronald our head waiter for taking such good care of us ( especially Mister Bentley, our 4 yr old grandson) ...... Great Cruise and CruiseLine!
2.0	Sail Date: Apr 15, 2018 /	"The ship itself was really beautiful, the service sucked, the food was delicious (well some of the food),  the good food you have to pay for. Husekeeping was amazing, we had a guy name Walter , he was the best. He was friendly, he went above and beyond for our family. The inside of the ship felt more like a mall instead of a ship and I felt I needed to dress up every time I left my room.  The buffet closes really early,  so they'll send you to Wipeout Cafe which all they have is nasty burgers and hot dogs. I purchased a drinking souvenir cup so I could have unlimited drinks but the only drinking machines were in the buffet so a lot of the time I couldn't even get drinks.  A sickness broke out and a lot of passengers got sick.  We had to port in Nassau towt a passenger get off and be flown back to Florida because she was really ill, which I think what made alot of people on board sick, so be prepared to have to sanitize ALL THE TIME! The pool area...  I hated it!  My daughter was not allowed to get in any of the pools because they said she was ""too little"" but there were older kids (13years old maybe)  in the kiddie area and that wasn't a problem.  Ice cream station closes at 8pm,  which was bad because most people crave sweets around that time, and the buffet is closed,  so you really have very limited options to choose from and a lot are bad. Sorrento's pizza place was AWFUL!  We've been on Cruise's before but we will go back to Carnival from now on. The ship is HUGE,  it's really nice, but I didn't feel like I was on vacation. I love to cruise but I would never sail on Royal Caribbean again."
3.9	Sail Date: Apr 08, 2018 /	"We let the ship know that we were celebrating our 30th wedding anniversary and
not one person acknowledge it. We told our travel agent, who put it in our paper work, we told our waiter,
we let them know the reason we were going to chops grille was to celebrate our 30th. When we booked they said they would make a note of it. We were very disappointed to say the least. 
When my husband asked what I would like to do to celebrate our anniversary, your cruise line and ship were my first choice."
5.0	Sail Date: Apr 08, 2018 /	"This ship is amazing! It is literally the only reason I tried Royal Caribbean, and may I say, it was worth it. This review will compare this ship to the 6 carnival ships I have been on, and the cruise lines themselves. 

The ship itself:
Royal Caribbean: Very massive! It takes about five minutes to walk to most places from your cabin. Lacks good hydration, it would take a while just to get water; they need more stations. Very well maintained ship ( stuff would brake and be fixed in 5 minutes ). I never felt motion sick, didn’t really feel the waves.
Carnival: smaller boats, more water is available. Stuff on ship stays broken for a couple of hours. Ships are not as impressive or huge. I would get motion sick at least once a cruise.

Food:
RC: Food is amazing! Almost everything was worth licking the plate for.
CCL: Food is good, but not as good royal Caribbean’s food.

Service: 
RC: ABSOLUTELY the BEST service I have ever had! The crew was absolutely amazing. They would do anything to make your cruise amazing.
CCL: very nice crew. Not as outspoken and you really only get to know one of them per cruise.

Other passengers:
RC: Older, but nicer! Most of the people on this boat are better off than carnival passengers. I could hold an hour long conversation with almost everyone I meet, who spoke English.
CCL: Just other passengers. Every other cruise you might meet someone who you become friends with, but that’s it. Most act like they are in major debt; or like they have to many kids to have fun.

Cabin:
RC: Nice and small! Only 2 beds and no pull downs. Our stewardess wasn’t very polite ether, but other cabin stewards seemed quite nice. The cabin has a stupid master switch that turns off the AC for the cabin, DONT PRESS IT!
CCL: Pull down beds, and very nice and small rooms. Stewards have always been nice and informative. No useless buttons and better AC overall.
-p.s.- I know that almost all cruise cabins are small.

Entertainment: 
RC: Better than carnival. Much more variety and more stunts. You have to make reservations and you have to be there at least 15 minutes early; it keeps you from enjoying a nice dinner in the dining room.
CCL: No reservations required. It’s easy to do comedy before dinner and show after. Not as much variety or as many stunts, thus  a lower quality of entertainment.

CCL: Carnival 
RC: Royal Caribbean

Please let me know if I can review any other part of the cruising experience for you. 

Here is some Oasis of the seas tips:
1. The life jackets are in the hallway, not the cabin.
2. In deck 14, port side, and all the way to the front is the sun deck. It offers the best view when leaving a port. You can also chill out up there at any time.
3. In the back of the boat, under the aqua theater, and beside the track is a nice and shady. Also, no one really knows about it and the chairs are already there.
4. The main dining room opens about 5 minutes early for late dining.
5. You can put drinks in the fridge that’s in your room. For example, I would go to the park cafe, grab a drink or two, and then take it to my room for when I get thirsty.

4.8	Sail Date: Apr 08, 2018 /	All in all, cruise was very nice - room was fantastic like before except for the water on the floor, staff seemed so different since the last two cruises on this ship.
4.2	Sail Date: Apr 08, 2018 /	It was fun, but I have learned that a bigger ship does not mean a better cruise.  More people seem to sometimes make for longer lines, less to do, and staff too busy.
4.5	Sail Date: Apr 08, 2018 /	First time on Royal Caribbean. Seemed like a great ship for families. We are Elite status on Celebrity which got us Diamond status on RC, will be returning to Celebrity, better food, friendlier staff.
4.4	Sail Date: Apr 08, 2018 /	LOTS OF FUN AND LAUGHS , GREAT TIME WITH HUBBY AND SISTER AND BROTHER IN LAW !  I AM A CRUISE ADDICT  SO  CRUISES ARE  GREAT FOR ME !
5.0	Sail Date: Apr 08, 2018 /	Anniversary Royal Suite 1758 is AMAZING. Large, beautiful, clean, and did I say AMAZING.  Comes with a Royal Genie and ours was also AMAZING. Having this cabin also gives you Unlimited beverage packages, complimentary specialty restaurants including any extras the restaurant offers.  This is basically a All Inclusive cruise. You are treated like royalty. And this was our 3rd time on the Oasis class ships and they are all beautiful.  Having a neighborhood theme, large pool areas and always places to lounge by the pool or solarium. Restaurants are all Great. Employees are all genuinely nice and helpful. I am loyal to Royal.
4.8	Sail Date: Apr 08, 2018 /	"We sprung for the suite experience this time and did not regret it. Getting on and off the ship was quick and easy. We had access to the suite lounge and took advantage of the drinks offered throughout the day. Reserved seats for the shows were also a great perk. We didn't have to worry about making reservations for anything and had the ability to change up our plans because of it. 
We ate at Coastal Kitchen, Chops, Izumi, Sabor, Solarium Bistro, Johnney Rockets, Park Cafe, Windjammer, Wipeout Cafe, and Boardwalk Dog House. Izumi was a bit of a disappointment. Everything else lived up to our expectations. 
The crew and staff really ensured that we had a great experience."
4.4	Sail Date: Apr 08, 2018 /	It was very nice can't wait to do it again. There is so much you can do on this ship you never get bored. The staff was very nice, play bingo it was fun.
5.0	Sail Date: Apr 08, 2018 /	I love it captain Claus is amazing and I’m so honored for him to be my captain of the cruise so glad they brought him back!!! Planning my next one already
4.0	Sail Date: Apr 01, 2018 /	Very large, tons to do for all ages. Definitely expect lots of kids. Love all the different 'neighborhoods'. Great food and specialty restaurants. Didn't like set up for 7th floor... was confusing at first depending what side you were on.
2.8	Sail Date: Apr 01, 2018 /	I’ve been on 3 other RCL cruises, so I was expecting similar experiences.  The food was sub par, and the menu never really changed at dinner.   The room was a decent size the only complaint was they don’t give shampoo and conditioner any more, just a soap dispenser in the shower. Also we kept finding item from previous passengers in our room.  The staff acted like they had to be there not like they enjoy their jobs.  Previous cruises our room steward and cruise staff and dinner staff were very engaging.  Which makes the cruise more fun.  It’s was very difficult to book shows.  We tried 2 months in advance and we only given the options of shows at 2:30 in in the day.  I wasn’t able to even see the show at aqua theatre, which really sucked since that was the show I wanted to see most.
3.9	Sail Date: Apr 01, 2018 /	I will never sail from port canaveral again. Why would you have three customs lanes open for 6000 people ?
4.9	Sail Date: Apr 01, 2018 /	Overall, the cruise was awesome. There was no shortage of activities, from the Broadway show “Cats”, comedy shows and movies by the pool to flowriders, rock climbing walls and the zip line.  The food was great, particularly Izumi and 150 Central Park.
4.8	Sail Date: Apr 01, 2018 /	We had a great time and definitely want to go on the Oasis again. One person had done the Western and Eastern Carribean on this boat and preferred the Eastern Carribean.  We loved our days at sea. There is so much to do and the shows and activities were fantastic. The food and service is top notch. You can't fit it everything you want to do in 7 days.
3.8	Sail Date: Apr 01, 2018 /	Had a great time. There are just too many people in the space for the money paid.
3.6	Sail Date: Apr 01, 2018 /	would never go on this ship again.  The food was sub par, the air conditioning did not work in any of our cabins.   The whole reserving a deck chair was not enforced until the last day, people were reserving chairs at 5 am but if you did it on the last sea day, they took your stuff away.  If you are going to enforce it, start with day 1.  The ship was way to large and to many people.
4.7	Sail Date: Apr 01, 2018 /	Fun, exciting and adventurous! Was a very enjoyable trip with my spouse. One note, don’t travel on a cruise during Spring Break, too many kids! LoL
4.6	Sail Date: Apr 01, 2018 /	First cruise.  Hopefully not my last.  Overall I thoroughly enjoyed our time on the ship and at the ports.
5.0	Sail Date: Apr 01, 2018 /	Just got back from our 7 day cruise. We had such a great time, this is a wonderful ship!!! Food is amazing, and all the shows were really good, especially Come Fly with me.
4.7	Sail Date: Apr 01, 2018 /	Overall a great cruise ship. I had such an enjoyable time with my friends. Alex was awesome and so was the food. Everyone was so nice and attentive. Would highly recommend this cruise.
5.0	Sail Date: Mar 25, 2018 /	So Far the best ship I’ve been on! The ship is MASSIVE and so much to do! You could literally meet people one day and never see them again haha. Would definitely go back on this one.
4.2	Sail Date: Mar 25, 2018 /	Had a very nice week on the Oasis. Lots to do and the service overall was good.  At times though, there weren’t enough bartenders and the wait was on the long side.
4.0	Sail Date: Mar 25, 2018 /	Loved the vacation, but I'm still conflicted about the ship and it's ports of call. St. Maarten was affordable, San Juan expensive & Labadee not as good as I hoped for.
2.3	Sail Date: Mar 18, 2018 /	I promised my friend who had never cruised she would see unbelievable entertianment we were not even allowed in any of the 3 shows offered for the entire week.  What happened to sitting at dinner with the same people to share your day and then going to the NEW DIFFERENT SHOW AFTER or vise versa. Everything  had to be Pre-booked or you were **** out of luck and I paid a **** Load Of Money for NOTHING!  I wanted to learn to surf, I snowboard and slolumn ski but to wait 2 hours to finally try and be done in 30 seconds while the people that no how get 10-15 minutes, this should be times 10 min for EVERYONE. Paid Extra for Balcony so we could have a cigarette now and then and no one told us we couldn't smoke out there any more.  The Cost of the Cruise was HIGH, flight $1,500, gratuity was so high and the cruise completely SUCKED.  All that money  you get from us and you can't afford diff entertainment every night where we either eat first then show or vise versa so you didn't have to THINK or STRESS or Constatly wait in line HOPING you could see a show but never get in to the 3 lousy choices with a high packed boat?  **** the comedy show held like 100 people how are 5,000 people supposed to get to see this in 7 nights so really there was only TWO different entertainment shows to pick from no wonder there was never any room to go see it the whole ship is supposed to squeeze into ONLY Two shows!!   CATS didn't even play 3 nights we were there, not that we would have gotten in cuz we were never told to PRE-BOOK.  I will BAD MOUTH the Oasis and cruises because if all the ships changed to this awful menu it won't be long until NO ONE Cruises any more!  All thru my 30's I cruised with  you guys 2 times a year and did everything from Alaska to islands THOSE WERE THE GOOD OLD DAYS, IT IS A TOTAL RIP OFF NOW, I WOULD NEVER WASTE MY MONEY AGAIN, YOU'd have to give me a FREE cruise and prove things changed before I waste another penny.  All these years I bragged up cruises and how they didn't compare to all inclusive resorts, what a joke now.  You guys really went Down HILL Big Time!
5.0	Sail Date: Mar 18, 2018 /	My wife and I are planning our next cruise as of right now can’t wait
4.9	Sail Date: Mar 18, 2018 /	Great ship good food nice people and wonderful staff  if u meet mark tell him I said one lov
4.0	Sail Date: Mar 18, 2018 /	i wou;d cruise on this ship again the crew was great the ship was great and the food satisfied me. if i were you and you never cruised on an oasis class ship get a balcony its worth the little extra.look at the touch screen waypoints to know where you are.. be confident the drinks package is worth it because the baretenders are the bom.. and try to do as much on the ship as possible and you will never be bored!
3.7	Sail Date: Mar 18, 2018 /	for the ship it was beautiful, staff they could care less, room was great, food felt like a golden corral, art gallery over priced talked a lot about Thomas Kinkade and had no clue about his gone with the wind collection when I asked, and tried to rip me off. I just love to cruise but ship was great in its look and size but overall was just ok, also room service is now $8
4.6	Sail Date: Mar 18, 2018 /	I will be right back on the same ship once is out of dry dock next year
5.0	Sail Date: Mar 18, 2018 /	We very much enjoyed our first cruise on the Oasis. Now we are hooked:)
5.0	Sail Date: Mar 18, 2018 /	Will cruise her again !  Royal sets the bar high for all other cruise lines for sure.
5.0	Sail Date: Mar 18, 2018 /	My husband and I just got back from cruise. We had an awesome experience. I felt so relaxed enjoy the foods and drink on cruise.  Hope I would have a chance to go again!
5.0	Sail Date: Mar 18, 2018 /	5 stars all day.    Best trip I’ve been on. If you have a chance to go on the lady oasis.  Do it you will have the time of your life.   Nothing bad to say. Nothing
4.5	Sail Date: Mar 11, 2018 /	"Every vacation/cruise has areas for improvement.  This one is no different, but I'd book it again in a heartbeat if there was an itinerary that I liked.  We booked another cruise while on this ship, so that tells you that we really enjoyed what we got with this one!

Also, find others on your same cruise on a Facebook group.  We met many new folks online first, and then in person at a FB group meet and greet at the beginning of the cruise.  It was nice to know a bunch of new people and have some familiar faces around the ship and on excursions."
2.2	Sail Date: Mar 11, 2018 /	Way to many people and maybe more crew members to help keep the younger children under control.
5.0	Sail Date: Mar 11, 2018 /	Went on this cruise for spring break and it was fantastic! The food in the American Icon dining room was great and our waiters and room steward were very friendly! Stateroom was well kept up with. If you have sea sickness, you almost can’t feel a thing on this ship.
5.0	Sail Date: Mar 11, 2018 /	It was our honeymoon and we had an amazing time. I definitely recommend it.
5.0	Sail Date: Mar 11, 2018 /	"Just off and we had an amazing time! Stayed in Crown Loft Suite 1828. Staff at Coastal Kitchen were amazing (Ben Mark and Omar) and our Room Attendants Camelia and Edgar. Food in Coastal Kitchen was amazing. Lots to do
And it never ever felt crowded. Travelled with my 16 year old son and he had a really great time. Had a far better time than we did on NCL Escape or Getaway where we always felt the boat was crowded and lined up.  Service in the specialty results (150, Chops) was great. Food was very good there too. If you have a chance in the evening go to the schooner lounge and check out Girl named Jake. Great singer. The group Vybe was great too.  Booked for March again in a aqua suite can’t wait!!"
3.0	Sail Date: Mar 11, 2018 /	In my opinion the Oasis needs to dry dock. The ships common areas are very worn. Chairs were torn in restaurants, the couch in our cabin was so dirty I put a towel down before I would sit.. We were on deck 10 overlooking the Boardwalk. We enjoyed sitting on our balcony and watching the action on the boardwalk. I would sail her again after she dry docks not before...
1.0	Sail Date: Mar 04, 2018 /	Have they moved your cabin ? We were in a cabin between two stairways  got moved to right next to stairs. No notice no nothing. We are on another boat
5.0	Sail Date: Mar 04, 2018 /	"Oasis of The Seas
Ok some of you have ask about the cabins at the front of the ship on The Oasis of The Seas. 
We just returned home from 7 days on this ship. First of all the ship is amazing!  Make sure you read your daily activities or you will miss so much.  
Now about the cabin.  Our cabin number was 10108 which is right in the front.  The cabin itself is very spacious.  We had lots of room and space to put our luggage. It has a sofa that's near the window which I liked but I didn't get to enjoy it because it was so warm near the window.  We did bump our heads a lot every time we got near the window. 
We barley had the drapes open due to the heat beaming in.  I was so upset because we did pay extra to have a window to enjoy.   
Before our trip I had seen comments about the room being hot so I kinda prepared.  
I purchased 2 emergency blankets and clipped them on the backside of the drapes and I even took a black curtain just in case the blankets weren't enough to help with the heat.  I'm glad I did as we had to clip it on the other side.  I also took a small fan which saved us!
Needless to say we only opened the drapes twice and the room was still really warm.  It would cool down some in the night as we slept.  
I couldn't imagine being in there during the hotter months. 
So if you  are a hot natured person I would say this room is not a good choice for you. 
Hope this helps some of you who are considering a room at the front of the ship."
5.0	Sail Date: Mar 04, 2018 /	Awesome ship! Even with a little bigger waves, I still didn’t get a sense of much rocking. Shows were great, ports were amazing, friendly staff, and lots to do. Loved this cruise!
4.2	Sail Date: Mar 04, 2018 /	We loved this ship. There is so much to do. We didn’t have time to do everything we wanted to do. We will have to go back for another trip to get it all done.
4.9	Sail Date: Mar 04, 2018 /	We have cruised on the Oasis quite a few times now and always enjoy getting away from the every day grind. This has been one our most enjoyable with Rocky and the Rollers Rockin' the Caribbean.
5.0	Sail Date: Mar 04, 2018 /	"Had an amazing time on Oasis of the Seas!  Just disembarked last Sunday. An awesome captain who took the time each day to explain our route and any relevant announcements!  First cruise we have been on where the captain is actively involved in our sailing comfort!

Food in MDR-delicious!  Windjammer packed but the dining staff was always right there to offer getting anything for you. 

Entertainment- El Gaucho -don’t miss it- unbelievably funny and talented. 

Embarkation -smooth and fast!!!!  Same for disembarking. 

Great cruise and beautiful ship."
4.6	Sail Date: Mar 04, 2018 /	We had an amazing time aboard Oasis of the Seas.  Staff were exceptional, meals were wonderful, and entertainment was great!  Can’t wait to go on another cruise with Royal Caribbean!
4.7	Sail Date: Mar 04, 2018 /	This was my wife and I's first cruise and other than the weather it couldn't have been a better vacation.
3.1	Sail Date: Mar 04, 2018 /	Will not be doing any more cruises. Have been on 5 and that's enough for me. There's only so much you can do on a ship, then it's just a repeat.
3.8	Sail Date: Mar 04, 2018 /	A nice time. Wish the weather would have been. Better so we could have enjoyed Haiti.
1.0	Sail Date: Mar 04, 2018 /	I booked a cruise for my family for spring break (the only time we can travel together) in April of 2018 for spring break 2019.  I just got an email from royal Caribbean (December-just before Christmas) that they cancelled my cruise for “maintenance” that week. “Sorry” the said, but offered only ridiculously paulty options. They treated me, a repeat customer, like dirt. I will never, never, never spend another dime on royal Caribbean the rest of my life. And i will encourage all i know to avoid them at all costs. Awful service. Awful way to treat loyal customers. Adiós royal Caribbean!!
5.0	Sail Date: Mar 04, 2018 /	We loved this ship. Going again this March. There was always something to do and we def did not see it all so going to do the stuff we loved and try out a few things we missed
3.4	Sail Date: Feb 25, 2018 /	Enjoyed my time on the ship  beautiful ship  I only have a couple complaints one the last day and half the water was terrible also the couch in our room was pretty stained up and also under the couch where the extra sheets and pillows is kept was very dirty also behind the couch noticed because we was looking for lost puzzle pieces also being I was in a room with a friend and grand daughter we would have perffered then bed made into twin beds also family’s with very little children would like away to give their children baths not showers
4.8	Sail Date: Feb 25, 2018 /	Could have been better getting on. get there early as you have to deal with over 5,000 people trying to get on.
4.0	Sail Date: Feb 25, 2018 /	"Just got off last Sunday after a fabulous week. Never felt like we were on a ship with 6400 passengers. Always able to find a chair on the pool deck. 

Things to note. 

Our waitstaff was incredible. Did 8PM dining and Randy took excellent care of us in the Silk. 
Ate one dinner at Chops. Main course was amazing. Filet was cooked perfect. Dessert was lackluster both at Chops and the MDR. Few changes each night so by day 7 nothing stood out to me. 
Ocean view balcony on deck 10 was great. Peaceful at night and offered some great picture opportunities. Stateroom attendant was always helpful when a request was made. 
Ports of call-
Maho beach in st. Maarten was $8 each way for a taxi per person. Got there early and managed to get two chairs and an umbrella for $20. Drinks at the bar were ok. Couple buckets of beer for the group of us was plenty. 
San Juan was wonderful weather. Worst part was the attacking cab drivers and tour operators as soon as you walked off the pier. We knew beforehand we wanted the tasting tour at Bacardi. RCCL doesn’t offer this one so my recommendation is to walk a block or 2 from the ship and get an uber. We got an XL for 6 people was was $18 each way. Well worth it. 
Labadee again had excellent weather. Walked to the far beach near the aquapark and just enjoyed sitting on the beach all day. 

Captain Per made the decision to take the long route back to Canaveral. Rough seas Saturday night but sounds like nothing compared to what they sailed into this week. 

In my opinion, Cruise Director Dan was lackluster. Never really heard him making announcements for things to do. Seemed like towards the end of the week there were periods of nothing going on. Again, just how it seemed to me. 

Shows-
We passed on doing Cats. Walked out after 20 minutes during the Headliner. I would watch Come fly with me and all the aqua shows again and again if I could. Comedy show was also great."
4.5	Sail Date: Feb 25, 2018 /	Even though we had some weather issues and high seas I didn’t feel it was bad. I slept like a baby.
4.0	Sail Date: Feb 25, 2018 /	Ship is beautiful. Cruise Director is fantastic. Entertainment was good. Food was ok. There was a mix up on our dining arrangements and we had to do My Time. Horrible experience.
5.0	Sail Date: Feb 18, 2018 /	Cruise ship was full of fun. Food and drinks always
5.0	Sail Date: Feb 18, 2018 /	It was our first time on a cruise ship and it was amazing. A variety of activities to keep you busy when sailing and numerous excursions when at a port. Already planning on our next cruise.
4.7	Sail Date: Feb 18, 2018 /	I loved this cruise.  This was my first cruise and I was blown away but the attentiveness of the staff, how nice they all were and how they seemed truly focused on making this a wonderful experience for your vacation.  I haven't been on any other cruises but this is my favorite vacation by far.  I was sad when it was over and was ready to book my next cruise with Royal Caribbean.  Even though I am back home, I am obsessed with learning as much as I can about company, the different ships, and the e up in the next few years to find another one to gone on.  I loved the attentiveness of the staff, the food in the main dining hall and the snacks in the other venues like Sorentos, the different activities and you can do as much as you want or as little.  It was hard to keep up with everything you wanted to do so decide what is most important because you can't do everything.  Use the Compass newsletter placed in your room at night to decide what you doing the next day.
4.4	Sail Date: Feb 18, 2018 /	Great ship, friendly staff just be prepared to be flexible!  If one venue or area is busy try another one!
3.8	Sail Date: Feb 18, 2018 /	A very good vacation!  Shows were outstanding and varied.  Service as usual was first class.
3.9	Sail Date: Feb 18, 2018 /	"overall an ok cruise but I regretted that I did not take harmony instead so we would have water slides and more kids focused environment.

Pros:
- The food in windjammer marketplace was excellent in terms of taste and variety
- the shows were excellent.
- The destinations were excellent.

Cons:
- I only ate at the the Main Dinning twice and the food was not good and variety was limited.
- Seating at the shows was not managed well so even if you had a reservations, you may end up standing because no seat were available if you got there 0-15 before the show.
- The ship lacked slides for kids.
- The smokers were a problem for me since I did not know where they were located and had to avoid them as I learned more about their designated location.
- I felt the Oasis was just OK ship not the best I have been on compared to other ships from Royal and other competitors.
- The interior cabin was too small for four. I am sure why they felt it was for four. It was doable but annoying."
4.9	Sail Date: Feb 18, 2018 /	We were a family of 6 including our 6-year-old grandson who was a first time cruiser. We all had a wonderful time, and there was something for everyone to do. I highly recommend Oasis of the Seas even to those who prefer smaller ships. It was an awesome experience, and I will never shy away from a mega ship again.
4.6	Sail Date: Feb 11, 2018 /	Great cruise,loved the ship,will go again!Loved the set up of the ship.Food and entertainment was good.
5.0	Sail Date: Feb 11, 2018 /	"This was such an awesome cruise and I will definitely go again.  For being such a large ship, I am amazed at how efficient they were at taking care of everyone. 

Food and Dining:  We never got tired of all the amazing food. We ate in the main dining room every night and really enjoyed each and every night. 

Stateroom:  We had an ocean view balcony room, which I would highly recommend. It was so nice to eat breakfast out on the balcony, and also just to sit outside at night and look out at the water. So relaxing. 

Service and Staff:  We were always treated so well by everyone.  And I had to admire how gracefully they handled the few rude guests that everyone had to endure.  Overall the service was so outstanding. 

Entertainment:  Wow. The performances were so great. Cats was pretty lame, but only because it’s a lame show. But not the fault of the actors. They all did a fabulous job. All the other shows were worth seeing again. 

Onboard Activities:  We never got tired of things to do. I enjoyed the flow rider and wish I could have had a little less people to share with. Lines were always long. So I did it once and didn’t want to wait in a long line again. The zip line was cool, but once was enough for me. They made me wear some super weird shoes, even though I was wearing tennis shoes, they said I had to wear their shoes. Even for the climbing wall too. Ice skating was fun, but there were so many little kids all over and so it was hard to really be able to skate very good. But it was still fun. Most of the time I hung out in the solarium, my favorite part of the ship. I am glad they dedicated a good size portion to adults only. Some people go on cruises to get away from their kids. 

Ship quality:  This was my first time on a ship this large, and my first time with Royal Caribbean.  I am very impressed with the high quality of everything. 

Embarkation:  took about an hour for the whole process. I have no complaints as it was well organized for getting that many people through all the security. 

Debarkation:  I was really surprised at how quickly it went. Way better and more organized than my experience with Carnival on some of their smaller ships."
3.8	Sail Date: Feb 11, 2018 /	Everything should've been included for I what payed for. And the gratuities were so out of place 14.50 dollars per person everyday just for tip. Ridiculous...
4.6	Sail Date: Feb 11, 2018 /	We really enjoyed our cruise and will cruise with Royal again in the future.
3.7	Sail Date: Feb 11, 2018 /	Nice and I'll do it again but in a different way.
4.0	Sail Date: Feb 11, 2018 /	Nice cruise overall   It was our first time on Oasis class ship   We were with a group of 6 and we all liked the ship but everyone said they enjoyed Voager and Fredom class ships better
4.5	Sail Date: Feb 11, 2018 /	Great cruise but there needs to be better food in the dining rooms.
4.0	Sail Date: Feb 04, 2018 /	Despite a few negative aspects, we have a really fun family vacation and would sail with RC again, but probably on a smaller ship so we can enjoy more with less people and walking.
4.7	Sail Date: Feb 04, 2018 /	Best cruise so far! Ship was very clean, staff was awesome and we loved Labadee.
4.0	Sail Date: Feb 04, 2018 /	My family loved this ship. The Boardwalk area and Central Park are amazing. My kids absolutely loved the character breakfast they offer and the parade on the last night. Adventure Ocean was also great.  The only complaint I have is their process for a missing child. My 4 year old ran off and we ended up losing him in the casino.  I was asking workers for help (thinking they could radio to others to be on the lookout) and was told I had to go up to Guest Services for help. At Guest Services, they weren't very helpful and I had to beg them to radio security to be on the lookout for my wild child before finishing filling out a form for them. But all was well in the end.
5.0	Sail Date: Feb 04, 2018 /	My only complaint about this ship would be they don’t offer coffee anywhere on the ship until 5:30 am on debarkation day! It would be nice to offer it at least somewhere
4.2	Sail Date: Feb 04, 2018 /	The cruse was great the ship was very impressive would like to go again but not to the places we went to
4.6	Sail Date: Jan 28, 2018 /	"Very big ship so pace yourself. With a lot of people did not feel crowded most of the time. The Royal Promenade is where we experienced the most crowding. Understandably because that in the ""heart"" of the ship. They have the dumbest muster drill ever! They pack you into a bar with very little seating and make you watch a stupid ""movie"" for what seemed to be 20-30 minutes. The required information in that movie could have been relayed to you in about 30-60 seconds. Tip: find your muster station early and get a seat!"
4.0	Sail Date: Jan 28, 2018 /	We just got off this ship yesterday! This was the first time sailing with Royal Caribbean and I have to say it was over all a great cruise! It was a not as much as a party ship like Carnival was but over all it was a nice one. I wish the sea would have been a little less calmer so we could have seen cats and the water show. We will be returning next year on the Liberty with our children.

4.8	Sail Date: Jan 21, 2018 /	Very large ship much different from smaller ships
4.1	Sail Date: Jan 21, 2018 /	Oasis is beautiful with lots to do.  We have gotten use to a smaller ship.  We follow the 7th Heaven Band out of Chicago each year on their Royal cruise.
5.0	Sail Date: Jan 21, 2018 /	"Second time within a year on the Oasis of the Seas. Really enjoy the variety of activities available on this class of ships. 

This cruise we chose a Boardwalk balcony instead of the ocean view balcony we had on the last cruise. Noise from activities on the Boardwalk could be a concern for early or light sleepers although we did fine with the noise. If I have another cruise on an Oasis class ship I will go back to the ocean view balcony again as I missed sitting on the balcony watching the ocean slip by. 

Crew and staff was great and helped make the cruise great. 

MDR food was good. Giovanni’s was good, just not my style. Chops was great as always. I could skip Johnny Rockets since I don’t think the food is worth the cover charge.

First class entertainment again this cruise."
5.0	Sail Date: Jan 21, 2018 /	Had a blast. Was a little concerned about the size of ship before cruise but found it not a problem. Was it crowded sometimes yes but overall no worries
4.4	Sail Date: Jan 21, 2018 /	Great ship to be on and lovely ports. The whole trip was fabulous
4.1	Sail Date: Jan 21, 2018 /	Beautiful ship overall, adored Central Park and our balcony room overlooking it, only ship I've seen with it. The Solarium and Windjammer were stunning and had amazing views. The Blaze was the perfect nightclub, great music, fantastic drinks, and bartenders. Liked the TVs so you could see the dance floor if not near it. Fantastic buffet food. Overall a wonderful and relaxing vacation.
3.0	Sail Date: Jan 21, 2018 /	I was very disappointed with this cruise. The ship was overcrowded and congested in all areas. I could not find room at the buffet on all visits. Many children running yelling screaming with out adult supervision. Saw one you boy getting a drink (none alcoholic) at a bar without parents. Elevators slow and skipped floors making for long waits. Tables in buffet were in need of repair and sticky because the varnish had worn off. Saw broken chair in bar and ripped seats. For the most part workers were unfriendly and avoided conversations, maybe they didn't speak or understand English, I'm not sure. I don't know if Royal Caribbean ships are all like this but this one was terrible. I tried to get information about a panama canal cruise and they had not brochures? I have been on Carnival, Holland America, Princess, this is the worst cruise I have ever been on. The ship is beautiful but in need of repair, the staff is not friendly and my complaints went no where.
3.3	Sail Date: Jan 21, 2018 /	I didn’t like this ship I felt they were understaffed and tired. I won’t go on another big ship
5.0	Sail Date: Jan 21, 2018 /	Just home from a week on Oasis of the seas. This was my 8th cruise and it was as good as the first one. Plenty to do on Oasis, our last day at sea was a little rough and the top deck and pools were closed but there was still plenty going on and plenty to do inside. We had an inside cabin, right at the front of the ship, not the best location as you could feel every moment of the ship and hear the waves crashing off the boat! Apart from this we had a fab time as usual!
5.0	Sail Date: Jan 14, 2018 /	We sailed on Oasis January 14-21and we loved her!  Can’t possibly do everything there is to do on a seven day cruise.  We had cabin 9596 on the hump and the Balcony was enormous!  The only drawback is that she is so big, and with the different neighbourhoods you tend to forget you’re on a ship.  I spent lots of time on our balcony to sit and enjoy the sea views.

5.0	Sail Date: Jan 14, 2018 /	"Oasis of the Seas was FABULOUS!
The customer service on board far exceeded anything I would imagine! 
Everyone was so nice 
The ship was SPOTLESS CLEAN! 
There was always someone cleaning something! 
Dining staff was amazing! Can’t say enough great things about them! 
Room was perfect! 
We loved it so much, we went to the “next cruise “ office on the ship two days before the cruise ended, and booked our next cruise!"
4.2	Sail Date: Jan 14, 2018 /	Overall we enjoyed the cruise.  Unfortunately the weather didn't cooperate and negatively affected several activities.
4.7	Sail Date: Jan 14, 2018 /	"Highly recommend 
While on board, we booked another cruise-trying the Jewel of the Seas next time-mainly because we were looking for a cruise to the more southern Caribbean, however, DEFINITELY staying with Royal Caribbean Line
Don’t over pack, you don’t need much! 
Absolutely fantastic cruise !"
2.6	Sail Date: Jan 14, 2018 /	Forget it-you are wasting hard earned money on this cruise.
4.3	Sail Date: Jan 14, 2018 /	Great cruise, think I prefer the smaller ships due to the volume of people.
5.0	Sail Date: Jan 14, 2018 /	Had a great experience and can’t wait to do it again!!!
4.0	Sail Date: Jan 14, 2018 /	Great experience  great value for money Central Park stunning plenty to do staff overall very good odd exception down side very very noisy in a lot of areas
4.2	Sail Date: Jan 14, 2018 /	Oasis remains my favorite ship. Love the variety of venues. The ship only feels crowded before cabins are ready and muster completed. Only minor disappointments that are due to Royal making changes, not the crew or ship’s fault. Good service and plenty to do.
5.0	Sail Date: Jan 14, 2018 /	My first cruise. It exceeded my expectations. Booked an Alaska cruise next year for my 45th anniversary.
4.8	Sail Date: Jan 07, 2018 /	Way to WOW all your guest Royal Caribbean!!! It's no wonder why RC is the BEST!!!
4.5	Sail Date: Jan 07, 2018 /	Overall the cruise was lovely, unfortunately there was an outbreak of norovirus on board and this meant that we couldn’t have lemon/olives in our drink etc. A lot of people complained about this. The staff were very open and honest about the outbreak and cleaned even more than usual. I would recommend anyone who goes on a cruise to wash their hands as often as possible and  sanitizer their hands on a regular basis.
5.0	Sail Date: Jan 07, 2018 /	"Book your shows on the ship early. I sail in January and I booked all the shows early in October. No issues here.😀 Get the drink packages that fit your beverage desires. Last time I booked the deluxe package and one of my friends of the group of us paid for each drink. He ended up paying a lot more than I did, but I had a lot more options and he felt like he couldn’t because he couldn’t afford it. I saved a lot. All my other friends did the same package as me. 
The Oasis is an outstanding ship, crew, shows, food, drinks.... can’t wait to go again but once I’m there I will slow down and enjoy every second of the adventure."
5.0	Sail Date: Jan 07, 2018 /	We so enjoyed our time. Our goal was to just relax and enjoy each other! Goal achieved!!
4.8	Sail Date: Jan 07, 2018 /	Overall a great cruise.  The ships team might have been a bit off due to the sanitizing work they were doing which was much appreciated.   We would do Oasis of the Seas again.  Our next three cruises are all RC with two of them on the Liberty of the Seas and one of the Adventure of the Seas.
5.0	Sail Date: Jan 07, 2018 /	Just got back from a week of pampering! Second time on this ship, probably still spaces we haven’t seen! Great staff and wonderful food! Had an absolute blast! Now back to reality!
4.0	Sail Date: Dec 31, 2017 /	"Me and my family traveled on the Oasis from Dec 31-Jan 7 a New Years cruise. I got cool perks that you would get if you went on another oasis travel day. But I won't explain that in this review but will explain what's good and bad about the cruise from the beginning to the end. I'll start with the bad stuff. In our staterooms they only add shampoo. They don't give you conditioner to make your hair soft and nice for a good picture. Instead we were lucky that he had saved some shampoo from a hotel we stayed at before the cruise. Another not so good thing is that the ship is really big! If your not a person that likes walking so much I don't recommend it for you as much. I think my final thing is that the ship isn't that fancy compared to Royal's smaller ships like the Navigator of the Seas. I think they did this because the ship is just so big. But don't worry the design of the cruise was still very nice and felt comfortable. Now moving on to the good stuff. Boarding was honestly the fastest I've ever been through. Royal Caribbean has perfected the fastest way to take lots of passengers on and off the ship. Even the boarding was faster than the Disney magic I went on. Even security was under 30 minutes. Even getting off the ship was a breeze. The staff were very nice and easy to talk with although the waiters are not as engaging as they are on other cruise lines. Our room was just a regular room and it was very nice. I love the Royal Caribbean added a couch in their staterooms so that you get a place to sit and relax after eating a lot instead of ruining your nice and fluffy bed. The shows were great with the musical Cats!!! Cats was so good and so alike to the real one. There were also comedy shows at the end of the trip that were pretty funny. Another thing Royal did on there oasis class ships that no other cruise line has done is that they added an open area that is not on the very top of the deck. If you don't know what I'm talking about it's the replica of Central Park and The boardwalk. These places were beautiful especially Central Park that was filler with real live plants! The boardwalk was quite nice since it had the aqua theater with really nice diving shows that I really enjoyed. The pools were also the way I liked it. There were a load of them and they were all just the correct depth. There were also a lot of jacuzzis that took relaxing to the next level. The ones in the solarium are nicer if you are an adult. I have saved the best thing on the cruise for last... THE FOOD! The food was next level and usually everyday they would have something different then before. I got no specialty dining because they were pricy but the food was still 5 stars. I got lobster and it was so good I ordered more! If I were honest if you have time on the cruise available eating at the main dining room not just for dinner but for breakfast and lunch is a very good option. They also had things like ice cream and a hot dog stand. The thing that surprises me along it that they had Johnny Rockets on board and breakfast for me was completely complimentary! This cruise was honestly the best I've ever been on in my whole life.

4.0	Sail Date: Dec 31, 2017 /	"I went with my wife on the oasis. It is a beautiful ship. It’s massive. Literally has something for everyone of all ages. But it definitely has its opportunities to be better. This is our 4th cruise, 3rd with RCC. For having 5000+ passengers onboard I never felt any major congestion. Other than mornings at the windjammer cafe but the lines moved fast. They really push hand washing and they have hand sanitizer everywhere. Which was great. 


The food is average at best. I got sick on the 4th evening. I don’t know if it was food poisoning or a stomach virus I caught from another passenger but i was horribly sick. I was taken to the infirmary and given a shot to stop ... well you know ... and then quarantined to my room for a 24 hr period. Because of this i was not able to get off at the port of st Martin. My wife refused to leave the ship without me so she missed it as well. We were very disappointed. While I was cooped up in the room she went to the spa and got a massage. She did say it was one of the best she had ever had. After that day it really started to go downhill. My stomach was never the same after that night and my meal options were really restricted after that. Solarium and Windjammer had great options and fresh fruit which helped every morning. The park cafe had great salads for lunch and dinner at the main dining hall was just bad. Very low quality food. The service was great though. Unfortunately we had to cancel at chops for dinner because we had the reservation the night after I was sick so I was stuck in the room. We did dine at Izumi hibachi which was AWESOME! Food, staff, entertainment was all on point. Sabor was great as well. Margherita’s were strong and delicious. Had Johnny Rockets for breakfast one morning. It was good. Missed 3 of our shows we booked because when I started feeling ill we were 15 minutes into the diving show and we had to leave. Later that evening was the headliner show and the following evening was the comedy show. Overall a bad vacation because of the circumstances. We have been looking forward to this and planning for months...
But We did see some amazing views, met some interesting people and left with some amazing photos and are grateful for that.


San Juan was beautiful and the weather was great that day. Really great city. I look forward to going back some day. We just walked the streets and visited a beach. Perfect afternoon. 

Unfortunately in Labadee it rained the entire day and the temp was around 65-70. They canceled our excursion because of the weather... we were refunded.. most of the passengers stayed off the ship for hours. We found some nice beach chairs and rented a beach umbrella to block us from the rain and relaxed for awhile until it really started coming down and we headed back to ship and hopped in the hot tub. 

We had a balcony room. Bed was ridiculously comfortable. We have a 15 month year old baby girl who still sleeps with my wife and I and having this king bed for 7 nights to ourselves was amazing. Balcony was awesome. We caught the sunrise almost every-morning."
3.0	Sail Date: Dec 31, 2017 /	"I have just finished my 6 or 7th cruise with Royal Caribbean International, The Holiday Cruise on Oasis of the Sea.  Most of the staff really tried to do a great job (our state room attendant, our dining room staff were all excellent); however this was not the case with the general boat staff.  

There was some kind of “Bar Fight” just before Midnight on New Years.  This involved several people, one being severely injured.  The boat was diverted to Nassau on Day 3, where all passengers sat on the boat for 4-5 hours while these less than intelligent individuals were arrested, processed, etc.  This caused us to be late getting into St Thomas the next day, the staff at the excursion desk were rude, to the point of telling us we were even lucky they were helping us rebook our excursion rather than just cancel it.

The massage I had at the spa was marginal at best, then a mandatory 18% gratuity was added and the massage person had the nerve to ask for more.

On Day 10 one of the floors was locked down while men dressed like “Swat” went door to door looking for someone.  I don’t think they ever found them.

The entire 8 days, I had only 2 general bar servers come ask if I wanted a drink.  I have always had 4-5 a day ask.  I don’t know what changes Royal Caribbean has made to their staffing and training, but it is not for the better.  It is also attracting a less than desirable class of passengers, if this cruise is what is their new norm."
3.9	Sail Date: Dec 31, 2017 /	"I think there are just to many people on this boat.  I have never been on a cruise where guests were stabbed, there were bar fights, we spent 5 hours in an unscheduled port so arrests could be finalized. One morning security dressed like “swat” locked down an entire floor looking for a male guest. 
The guests in the suite next to us continually smoked on their deck, when we reported it nothing was ever done even though this is a fire hazard.  It ment we paid for a deck we could not enjoy."
5.0	Sail Date: Dec 24, 2017 /	Had a blast. Would recommend this ship to anyone. I would ask for Francisco to be your waiter for dinner, hands down the best!!! Would definitely go on this ship again!

My daughter for engaged on Christmas and my step son had a birthday on the cruise and the staff did everything to make it a wonderful time.  Highly recommend.    Just sit back and relax.
5.0	Sail Date: Dec 24, 2017 /	This ship was great! There was so much to do.  The ship was big and clean.  There is a variety of restaurants and entertainment for adults and kids.  Can’t wait to get back to RCI.

5.0	Sail Date: Dec 24, 2017 /	This was a Christmas cruise with our children and grandchildren.  We sure made a lot of wonderful memories.
3.0	Sail Date: Dec 24, 2017 /	Getting on the ship was very organized. Luggage was outside our door when the rooms were ready at 1:00 pm. Explored the ship once we unpacked and relaxed in the room. The size of the room was a bit smaller, such as the closet space, but no big deal. The balcony was larger than those on other cruise lines. Of course it is a large ship so crowding is an issue. The buffet never had long lines except for the first day due to everyone being hungry after arriving on the ship. Our steward seemed to not change the bed sheets but twice over the course of the week. Although that’s about how often we wash ours at home, I expected it to be different while on vacation. Another fault was the towel animals. It’s always a joy to see them when coming back after a long day, however we only received one small bear on our fourth day. We did not tell guest services since we didn’t want to make a big deal. Food was good, nothing crazy. The musical entertainment throughout the ship lacked, including the nightclub which we had hoped would be more fun. There were a lot of kids that would run through the hallways knocking on doors and ringing the doorbells to the suites, as well as push all the buttons on the elevators and then run and do it to more. There were many groups of teenagers sitting on the staircases between 10 pm to 12:00 am just talking, laughing, making noise and being in the way of people using the stairs. I would hope that parents could control their children more or at least staff tell them something as they witness it going on (which we saw, they just ignored it). Getting off of the ship in other countries was a breeze, in addition to getting back on. Plenty of things to do for ages between 12-17 (such as having competitions for that select age group only) and many shows for those that like to simply sit back and relax. Overall it was a very fun time just being on vacation and being able to see new places.
4.4	Sail Date: Dec 24, 2017 /	This truly was a dream cruise for us all. We enjoyed it tremendously.
5.0	Sail Date: Dec 24, 2017 /	Amazing experience on this ship (first time cruisers)...so much to do and the food was delicious..plenty of room even though the ship was fully booked.
4.0	Sail Date: Dec 17, 2017 /	I have been in this ship a few times now. It is massive, but does not feel over crowded, until you want to participate in one of the event/shows. You have to make reservations for everything, and you have to make those reservations at least a month before you get on board. This takes away from the relaxing vacation mood because you are always on a schedule. I prefer to be able to go with the flow, and just check the cruise compass and pick something going on right then and there.
5.0	Sail Date: Dec 17, 2017 /	Oasis was one of the biggest ships I have been on (granted, I've only been on 4 cruises to date). It felt like it's own city. The ship itself was fabulous and the staff was absolutely wonderful! It was a great family cruise. It balances the night life and family oriented aspects very well. Would definite cruise on Oasis again :)
4.7	Sail Date: Dec 17, 2017 /	Overall great ship and crew they do anything you need and excursions were fun and exciting
3.8	Sail Date: Dec 10, 2017 /	While this cruise ship is amazingly beautiful, we would have liked to have had access to a coffee house on the upper decks (one has to go to deck 5), water slides would be enjoyable, and less glass on the front of the ship for those of us who enjoy an unobstructed view of the ocean.
4.0	Sail Date: Dec 10, 2017 /	Just got off the Oasis of the Seas yesterday. The ship itself is amazing and some of the crew were great and some of them were very disrespectful and rude I even had a problem with one of the crew where they actually referred to me as a female dog. Our dining staff was amazing our head waiter helped make sure everything was perfect with our food and dining experience. This was my second time on the Oasis of the Seas.
5.0	Sail Date: Dec 10, 2017 /	Just got of the Oasis today! Had an absolute blast! The boat is big, and I will definitely be cruising it again as I didn’t get to do everything I wanted too! But I did get to Zipline!!! But would definitely recommend it! My husband, 2 year old, and myself had an awesome trip!
5.0	Sail Date: Dec 10, 2017 /	We just finished our first cruise with Oasis of the Seas and our  experience was very positive. The staff was very cordial and helpful. We got a little ancy toward the end but were told that is normal for first cruisers. The  process flowed well. Ship was above adequate in entertainment,shopping and food quality. We sale agian in December 2018!!🛳
5.0	Sail Date: Dec 10, 2017 /	"This was our first Star Class booked room (Our previous was Sky). Needless to say it was fantastic. From the minute we arrived at the port we were treated no less than Presidential. 

Arrival to port: 930 am. We waited outside for approximately 15 minutes by the front entry. My wife asked a young lady where the line for suites and Star Class were and she promptly showed us making sure that we kept our luggage with us. She quickly went back inside and seconds later two people emerged asking who the star class guests were. At that point they let us in with a porter and luggage in tow. 

At that point we were escorted to the check in desk (no line) where we found our Pre-Cruise documents mostly prefilled. All we had to do was check a few boxes and sign. Nice touch. Our cards were issued and off we went to a private waiting area where snacks and beverages awaited. 

While in the waiting area (approximately 30 minutes) our Genie found us, introduced herself and stayed with us until boarding where she escorted us to our room. Top notch service. Lasted approximately 50 minutes start to finish. Keep in mind we showed up early. 930am

While in our room our Genie informed us of all our amenities and went over the weekly schedule that she had put together for us, which she used information from the Pre-Cruise questionnaire that we received 30 days prior to our cruise, as well as email conversation two weeks prior. 

Although we did appreciate our Genie, this person did miss two simple requests (we had very few) that we had mentioned in the pre questionnaire. One was, my wife wanted to go ice skating and I wanted to go on the zipline. 

Yes these things are easily booked onboard by walking up to the zipline during normal operation or looking through your daily planner for skating, but this is not the point of having a royal genie as they are supposed to make things happen for you and in most cases are behind the scenes. This adds to the experience. (We have read multiple reviews where this has happened regularly. It is also stated in the description listed under Genie services. )

We recieved treats in our room only one day. Past experiences example: the Haven on Norweigion. The butler brought us snacks daily. We never asked, it just happened. 

It was awesome! 

Some may say, why not just pick up the phone and ask? This can be done, but not having to and being surprised is the difference between being in a standard room (which is fine, we have sailed in plenty) and being in a suite with a genie. For those that do not live like this on a daily basis all but for 1 week a year, understand the feeling when someone takes a few moments to think if you. It's above and beyond service. 

My advice is if this happens, just pick up the phone. I do believe they will make it happen. Try not to get to caught up in what should have been as your on your cruise. Enjoy it. 

Some on board (different genie as there were 3 assigned to 11 rooms, ours had 3 assigned to her) experienced the opposite.

We look forward to our next Genie experience!

Services we recieved onboard:

Starbucks (free) except for cakes/snacks. Keep in mind that you must show them your card first otherwise they automatically charge you. 

Specialty restaurants:
( All Free) they see your card and will move mountains to seat you.

Alcohol/Drinks: unlimited drinks $13 dollars and under or you pay the up charge. PS. They see the card and pour extra alcohol in your glass. It really is Star Class treatment. 

A drink cart (free) passed our room every day around 330pm. These drinks were specially made for Star Class only. Nice touch. 

All soda specialty waters etc (free) stocked to capacity in our room daily. 

Johnny Rockets (free)

Icecream from the shop (free)

Laundry (free)

Get the concept? You pay for almost nothing. Our bill on day 6 was comical. 
We realize though that we did pay in advance. That's ok because it was worth it! 

Departure:

Still hasn't happened as we are on board but here's what we got so far. 

Vallet luggage is included at no extra charge. If you choose, on day five your genie will collect your fight info. She returned the next day with luggage tags pre-printed from the airline. You simply attached them to your bags and leave them outside your cabin by 11pm. The next time you should see them, is at your destination airport. They also checked us in to our flight and gave us our boarding passes. Awesome service as when I went on the my airline app, I was already checked in. They literally do it all for you.

I am sure I missed something but I am open to questions. I hope this review helps future star class passengers understand the process a little bit better. The information was limited going on for us, so I wanted to offer some up. 

We hope you all enjoy your upcoming cruises on this beautiful ship!

Until next November...





Make no mistake, we still enjoyed the service. This is mostly for Royal Caribbean to take note. 

Royal Caribbean is our preferred cruiseline. While on board, our experience carrying a black card was second to none as when the crew noticed the card their demeanor changed. They really made us feel important."
4.6	Sail Date: Dec 10, 2017 /	The cruise was wonderful. My entire family had a ball which is not easy to achieve with a 12, 10, and 4 year old, plus 2 adults. We enjoyed the food and the entertainment. Royal Caribbean is the best cruise line in our opinion. There is always something to do!
4.4	Sail Date: Dec 10, 2017 /	This was a great cruise. I have been on the same cruise before and enjoyed it just the same. I would advise anyone to do a dolphin excursion.
4.4	Sail Date: Dec 10, 2017 /	We had a good experience on the Oasis of the Seas. The ship was beautiful and the staff was very attentive and courteous. I like the amount of activities to do on the ship throughout the day and the variety of food. We never went hungry on the ship but there were times in the cabin I wished I had my snack drawer. Planning our next cruise with Royal Caribbean in 2018.
5.0	Sail Date: Dec 03, 2017 /	"This is my ""Go-To"" ship. It is beautiful! The food is delicious, with many options. The Park Cafe in Central Park neighborhood is a great place for a salad and sandwich, but it's small and can be very difficult to find seating. The entertainment is excellent, however, I preferred Hair Spray over Cats, just personal taste."
4.6	Sail Date: Dec 03, 2017 /	"Nice we have more cruises planned
Steaks should be thicker even if there smaller and should be a better grade of beef xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx"
4.1	Sail Date: Dec 03, 2017 /	All in all the trip was good. Had fun with my family. The ship is beautiful! Staff is always friendly. Try Central Park 105.  On the last night when everybody was clramming into chops grill. We went to 105 for the second time. The food great!
4.4	Sail Date: Dec 03, 2017 /	Overall a great trip. We would definitely go again. Maybe a bit smaller ship next time in order to possibly enjoy more of the shows. Otherwise, we had a great time. We made a lot of new friends
5.0	Sail Date: Nov 26, 2017 /	The best vacation ever! The Staff was amazing; great food; great entertainment! Only downside we’re the long lines for certain things but it is understandable as there are thousands of guests (literally). But overall we loved it!
5.0	Sail Date: Nov 26, 2017 /	"Awesome time on the Oasis. Great shows, wonderful food. Relaxing trip. 
The Solarium Bistro was wonderful place to eat at dinner to get away from crowds. Park Cafe for Roast sandwich and salad is a must."
4.9	Sail Date: Nov 26, 2017 /	"My husband and I returned several days ago from cruising on Royal Caribbean's Oasis of the Seas. This is my lengthy review. Let me first say, the following is based on ME and MY HUSBANDS experience. This is MY opinion and is to assist others in their cruising decision.

This cruise vacation was EPIC. We absolutely LOVED our entire trip. Our room attendant, Jesus, was very attentive. He knew our names immediately and used them several times throughout our cruise. He made towel animals for us and kept our room spotless and tidy. Once, when we left our room, took the elevator up to the Windjammer, and my husband returned to the room to retrieve our cruise compass. When he returned back to the the room, Jesus was already in there tidying up. We made sure to give him a personal tip at the end of our stay.

In the Windjammer, the buffet area, there was always a waiter coming around to offer coffee or collect dishes. In the main dining room, we enjoyed conversation with our waiters, who were very attentive and hospitable.

Tim, our cruise director and Margo, the activities director, were extremely helpful. We could always find them offering helpful information on RCTV. And Tim is hilarious.

The staff on the entire ship was professional, courtesy, and overall, dope.

There were so many activities on board that I couldn't get it all in. I had planned to try the FloRider and ice skating rink, but was a little afraid of hurting my arthritic knees. Ironically, I had so much to do that I didn't miss not participating in those activities. I used the zip line and tried to climb the rock wall - yes, TRIED ;-)

The entertainment on board is simply excellent. While hubby had planned to spend quite a bit of time at Jazz on 4, the ships jazz club, I wasn't particularly excited about doing so. However, we spent parts of 4 nights in the club, and it turned out being one of my favorite parts of the cruise.  The ships jazz artist, Jess Young and quartet, displayed exceptional talent. Hubby and I even had an opportunity to meet her drummer and had a long conversation with her.

Come Fly With Me, a broadway style stage production, and the Oasis of Dreams, a water acrobatic-style show, were excellent and very entertaining. The family-friendly comedy show was actually funny. Kenny James, a real show-stopper of an entertainer, was great. We met him and he was kind of enough to snap a photo with us. 

Central Park, a living park at sea, offers a quiet alternative to the hustle and bustle of the busy pool deck. We found a wedding party and even a violinist and pianist playing modern tunes.

We're not big shoppers, but there were many opportunities to shop on board, with lots of sale promotions and no-fee raffles. I purchased a beautiful watch that came with bracelets. The Royal Promenade offers the Rising Tide Bar, a DJ, a parade and even the kitchen staff coming through.

The Solarium is a beautiful oasis that offers some peace and quiet from the hustle and bustle of the ship. Sometimes it was crowded, but with beautiful views and a relaxing environment, there are plenty of on-board options to relax.

Oasis of the Seas is a huge ship. We were completely prepared, having watched nearly every YouTube video available featuring this vessel. We walked the ship, walked the track and even spent some time in the fitness center. There are so many things to do on-board for seven days, we never got bored. We even got in a couple of mid-day naps.

With stops in Labadee, Haiti - Royal Caribbean's leased part of the island, Falmouth, Jamaica, and one of our favorite spots, Cozumel, Mexico, the ports did not disappoint. Whether you're a shopper or thrill seeker, there are plenty of activities to get into. Or you can just lay at the beach all day. Labadee offers the longest zip line over water and an alpine slide-type roller coaster. The beach is inviting and Royal Caribbean provides a buffet lunch with beverages. We decided not to do an excursion in Falmouth and still had a great time in the port. We shopped the local artisans wares and enjoyed having conversations with them. In Cozumel we rented a Jeep, visited a beach and snorkeled - one of my favorite things, ate a local restaurant, and shopped. We had an absolutely wonderful time at all three ports. 

This was only our second cruise, and our first on Royal Caribbean. We've decided that RC is our cruise line of choice. It offers exactly what we needed - a much-needed vacation of rest, relaxation and refreshment, and over a thousand photos and videos. We are already planning our next Royal Adventure."
4.7	Sail Date: Nov 26, 2017 /	This was the best cruise on one of the biggest cruise ships in the world. Will do another cruise on the ship real soon. The food and venues were great. I would love to stay on the ship nextime we are in port
4.9	Sail Date: Nov 26, 2017 /	This was our third cruise and by far the biggest ship we had been on, although it was big the ship never seemed crowded there is a lot of space on board. In our opinion the cruise would have benefited from another port of call.
5.0	Sail Date: Nov 26, 2017 /	I’m only a second time cruiser but I just got back on Dec 3rd. I was solo. I had a wonderful time. The food was excellent and the entertainment was top notch especially the aqua show and the ice skating. Cats was long but the costumes and singers were awesome. I would love to go on Oasis again. I hung out in Central Park a lot and on the pool deck and Promenade.
4.0	Sail Date: Nov 26, 2017 /	"This was our second time on Oasis. We just came off of the 11/26 cruise. It did not start out so great.  However, it ended better. The first night we had dinner in Chops Grille, although the food was excellent, the service, was something to be desired.  The waiter served half of the appetizers, missing garnish on the main course and had to leave the table to get a glass of wine. Overall poor experience. The Next Cruise attendant was not helpful and did not book another cruise. We will work with our travel agent. Excursion prices are very high. You have to continuously review your bill as we were charged for drink items that were included in our package and have them removed twice. In this day an age, technology is the main means of communication and WiFi should be included or lower the price. 

The room was clean and well maintained. Harry our attendant was awesome. He was friendly and very respectful. 

Food and service in the dining room was great. With the exception of the first night it was as usual a great experience. 

Since we have only done 6 cruises and they have all been with Royal Caribbean and can’t compare them with any other cruise line, we are still loyal to Royal and look forward to our next cruise."
5.0	Sail Date: Nov 26, 2017 /	Awesome cruise. Loved all three ports. The food was excellent in the dining room, windjammers, room service, you name it. Hardly saw any kids on this cruise. Only saw them in the dining room. The shows and venues were great. For the shopping, we could find gifts for everyone.
5.0	Sail Date: Nov 19, 2017 /	It’s definitely my favorite cruise I’ve been on, EVER! Staff are amazing, they want only the best for you! Food was good, but not amazing. Same rotation of fish, soup and meat. It was yummy though! Embarkation took relatively long only because we forgot one of our party’s registration forms. Debarkation was a BREEZE. Literally the fastest I’ve ever experienced. Onboard activities were so fun, you can always find something to do. Particularly love the dancing classes/parties, the instructors are hilarious! Cats was good, but if you don’t want to sit in a chair for 2 hours straight besides intermission, it’s not for you. The makeup and costumes were outstanding! The actors work super hard and you have to give credit to them! The Aquatheater show was awesome! The divers and acrobats were so entertaining! You get more than you “reserved” for! :) We has a Boardwalk view balcony, and I have no complaints! You would think there would be a problem with sound during the day, but the balcony sliding door blocks out literally ALL SOUND. It’s crazy. All in all, it was a fun experience and I can’t wait to do it again!
4.1	Sail Date: Nov 19, 2017 /	Great trip will definitely do a cruise again.  Looking at Alaska next time.  Loved having the same waiter every night.  Roger took care of us.   Room was great
4.8	Sail Date: Nov 19, 2017 /	Had a great time, can’t wait till next time. Learned many lessons.  Every R/C employee had a good attitude. Looking foward to the next one. The best advice I can share is you must understand “ ITINERARY SUBJECT TO CHANGE “ and if it changes you will not get a refund. Keep that in mind and don’t let I ruin your cruise.
5.0	Sail Date: Nov 12, 2017 /	All I can say is wow what a ship been on it  2 years befor this and loved it this time was just amazing food room and staff can not fault at all the boarding was a bit of a mess never had to line up before and took around 30 to 40 mins in the sun so can imagine we got a bit hot but part from that I would recommend this to anyone
3.0	Sail Date: Nov 12, 2017 /	Was entertaining and fun ship mostly. Decent shows but not as many activities as we’re used to. The food was just okay, the menu stayed the same the entire cruise. We’d go back to royal Caribbean but wouldn’t be our first choice to pick. Admittedly a bit biased to ncl though!
3.9	Sail Date: Nov 12, 2017 /	Oasis is way to big of a ship to get personalized attention. I will be cruising smaller ships in the fleet from now on. I was tired of everyone trying to sell things, specialty dining, photos, onboard shopping etc. the drinks were expensive and weak. The rooms were clean. The staff was friendly. The food was mediocre.
4.8	Sail Date: Nov 12, 2017 /	Great cruise! The staff, shows, ship and excursions were outstanding.  There was so much to do, or if you wanted there was plenty of space to just relax.  The ship didn't seem crowded and at times there really was many people around.  Will definitely cruise again!
5.0	Sail Date: Nov 12, 2017 /	"Second cruise with Royal Caribbean.
There is nothing that this ship (Oasis) fails to deliver.
From the ports with arrived and stay at which were very clean and well worth getting off the ship just to take a look. Watch out for the pushy shop owners though.
There was only one negative comment which was from my stop on the Island of Haiti again food was plenty full and delish but the baps and breads were also food for the flys too. 
Staff were all friendly and work extremely hard to add to an amazing memorie.
So looking forward to my next.
Food Photos Entertainment Rooms Shows all very top notch quality in one huge ship."
5.0	Sail Date: Nov 12, 2017 /	Had a perfect vacation on board the oasis!  Everything was flawless in my opinion.  The attention to detail is amazing.  The windjammer food was pretty standard buffet quality, lots of variety and only had to wait once for seating.  The main dining was one of the highlights.  Super attentive staff and food so good you eat it slowly to savor every bite.  The shows were all very entertaining and world class.  The ship is huge and takes a while to get from one end to the other but offers so much to do.  There were times when we felt like the only ones on the ship, having a hot tub all to ourselves or being the only ones in a bar at times.  I was on the fence about the drink package but decided to get it once on board and I'm glad I did.  I was able to try so many drinks i otherwise wouldn't have and it's nice to be able to just grab and go and not have to worry about calculating costs in your head every time you order a drink.  I've heard from several people that the smaller ships are better but I honestly couldn't imagine this trip being any better than this.
2.5	Sail Date: Nov 12, 2017 /	Terrible ...... a waste of time and money and wind up with food poisoning from a cruise line that I always thought to be a leader in the industry ....... what a rude awaking I had ...... and I have been on other cruises .... not my first .... but probably my last ..... Good Luck !!
5.0	Sail Date: Nov 05, 2017 /	Went to Nassau  last year  . Straw market was terrible  hunted  us down to buy Keychain  and junk . Went though about 5 tour  guides  . Staying on ship this time
4.0	Sail Date: Nov 05, 2017 /	"Amazing ship with awesome Staff.
I expected it to feel overcrowded due to having 6,000+ people onboard but this was not the case at all.
Did feel you lost that personal touch you get on smaller ships as just so many people.
Beds are very comfy and rooms are a good size as we always get interiors and was not disappointed at all.
First Time we have done my time and it was great and food was lovely in American icon.
The food selection in Windjammer was not always great but the Park Cafe is a lovely choice for lunch."
5.0	Sail Date: Nov 05, 2017 /	The entire cruise was awesome. The staff were great. The food was awesome. I have no complaints. My stateroom attendant Earl was awesome. We are definitely coming back. I met a lot of really nice people on the ship as well.
4.0	Sail Date: Nov 05, 2017 /	We would cruise on this ship again.  Lots to do and the staff was friendly and helpful.   Ship was well laid out and easy to get around. Central Park was very peaceful.
3.5	Sail Date: Nov 05, 2017 /	Lovely ship but we prefer the food on Carnival even though the ships are not as nice.  My husband does not like the casino.  Prefers the Carnival casinos.
3.1	Sail Date: Nov 05, 2017 /	overall, very disapointed. lack of personel to give good customer service. Food was just ok. casion was not organized as well as it should have, lost all points because when i insert my card other peoples names would show up  hd to get new card 3 times. Photos that were taken by crew were terrible and was missing a lot.
5.0	Sail Date: Nov 05, 2017 /	From start to finish the cruse was very well executed. The service on ship was excellent, the food was great and plenty to choose from. Personally I do not have anything bad to say about the ship. We had a wonderful week.
5.0	Sail Date: Oct 29, 2017 /	Lady O was amazing! Went over Halloween 2017 and it was so much fun! The staff was all very helpful. Met a few new cruise friends and discovered new favorite drinks. I can’t wait to sail on Lady O again.
4.0	Sail Date: Oct 29, 2017 /	I love this app but there is one thing I wish you could do is updated the ships tracking information the Oasis has been at the same spot for 6 days ugh
4.1	Sail Date: Oct 29, 2017 /	If you love lots of activity, Oasis is a beauty and will not disappoint you.  If you like a more quiet experience, I'd suggest Royal's Vision of the Seas class of ship instead.  Much, much smaller and much more intimate.
3.0	Sail Date: Oct 29, 2017 /	This ship is so huge, and it doesn’t feel like a ship. It feels like sitting and strolling around a mall. It’s not a big thing. It’s just a different feel when you don’t feel any ship movement. A lot to do, a lot to explore. Central Park is my favorite because it’s quiet like solarium. Speaking of solarium, it’s also a wonderful area to spend time. I only wish the center pool were heated. Boardwalk is also a unique place to experience. I enjoy sitting there; getting drinks at Sabor bar and complimentary hot dog. Now, here are some disappointments. First, food quality and variety could be improved. I wasn’t impressed with food in MDR at all. Celebrity, Holland America, and Norwegian has done way better in this department. We ended up finding the same or more variety at the Windjammer. Second, it needs a better solution to improve such a heavy foot traffic in the Windjammer. It seems to be hectic all the time. Such a huge ship, it should use another Windjammer on a different spot on the ship. Izumi was great, I give it two thumbs up for what it is. Not so much about Sabor however. Food was so meh, I’d rather go to Chipotle. Better yet, it should have been complimentary like Carnival’s Blue Iguana Cantina. Last, I’m a spa fanatic, and I find the spa area is quite small; considering how big the ship is. Overall, It’s very different. It has something for everyone, and I enjoy this ship class. Ultimately, it helps me understand my cruise preference so, in future, I can choose one that suits me better. Perhaps, something slightly smaller.
5.0	Sail Date: Oct 29, 2017 /	"From the time we got onboard til we departed, this was a great cruise.
Can not say enough about how happy we are that we were there.
The shopping on board was great.
We loved the pizza and had coffee and tea at the cafe on Deck 5 many times.
Central Park was our go to place to grab a quick bite or drink and enjoyed sitting in this outside atmosphere.
Absolutely a fabulous deck to just sit and enjoy.
Loved dining at the many spots and restaurants."
4.0	Sail Date: Oct 29, 2017 /	"The ship is wonderful with lots to do. I’ve sailed 4 times with Royal and I’m already looking for number 5. I will say that this was by farrrrr the smoothest riding cruise I’ve ever been on. I think I really only felt the ship rock a little on the last two days but that could’ve just been the result of the deluxe beverage package kicking in.
I found the food to be ok at best. I must admit that I only ate in MDR for dinner and Windjammer for breakfast and lunch. My waiter Floribeth and assistant waiter Sabastio were unbelievable. They made us feel like we were their most important people to serve. Their attention to detail made the meals better. Sabastio seen us several times in the windjammer and every time he immediately stopped and came directly over to us to assist in whatever we needed. Not only to serve but to talk and share personal experiences and cruise tips as well.
Our cabin was ocean view balcony on deck 14. To my surprise it was a very quiet cabin. We took naps every day and never had an issue with noise from above us. Our stateroom attendant was good our room was kept clean but I must admit my wife isn’t one to leave a mess behind for someone else to clean. With that being said any request we made she granted very quickly.
The music especially the band Muzik Express who played in Dazzles was excellent. Their range of music was incredible from 50’s to today’s top 40, country, jazz, r&b, rock they played it all and kept the dance floor crowded. They really needed a bigger venue in my opinion. The two main vocalist blew me away. At first I assumed they were like any other party band good musicians and just decent singers who kept the party going but boy was I WRONG! They showed that they could really blow. I mean she sang some Whitney Houston that Whitney herself would’ve given a standing ovation and then followed up with a mind blowing rendition of Bahemein Rhapsody. The only downside is I didn’t find this band until day 4.
Well with the good I only have a couple disappointing areas. I would’ve loved to hear more Caribbean music by the pool. I only remember hearing it twice on a 7 day cruise. I was looking forward to seeing Ice Sculptures and Fruit Carvings. Those are my only real issues and if that’s all I can semi complain about then I’m happy. 
To sum it all up.........WE HAD A BLAST!!!"
4.8	Sail Date: Oct 29, 2017 /	Enjoyed and relaxed... Always enjoy vining the islands... Would be nice to stay later and enjoy night life on the islands... The Caribbean will be our travel area for now.. May plan a cruise up north for the fall period.... Royal Caribbean is very accommodating....
4.1	Sail Date: Oct 29, 2017 /	This is a great ship and crew! We had a great week with an extended family of 26 on a memorial cruise for my aunt who had been on about 26 cruises with husband. Once in a lifetime memory! Glad we could do it with RC!
4.8	Sail Date: Oct 29, 2017 /	Great cruise, great staff, awesome ports and excursions! The entertainment options were immense - we went non-stop every day!  Amazing experience, we'll be back soon!
4.3	Sail Date: Oct 29, 2017 /	Loved it but would try another ship next time.We take several cruises per year and our next is on Holland America.I will say we got excellent service on the ship and the staff all had smiles always.
3.0	Sail Date: Oct 29, 2017 /	Was my worst cruise to date. I still enjoyed some parts of the cruise, but overall a bust! The smaller ship's are by far the way l will cruise from now on. Maybe not as much to do but there is room to do what you want.
5.0	Sail Date: Oct 29, 2017 /	This ship is incredible. If you sail on it do t miss the action on the promenade deck almost every night, parades and things around 6 or 7 pm. Cabins were well kept and quiet at night. Food at Chops steak house is fantastic. Ship never felt crowded except on the promenade deck during activities but that was a great time even with the crowd. Shows were top rate. I have cruise on many ships but this one is hands down my favorite. Even disembarking at ports was never crowded, unbelievable!
4.6	Sail Date: Oct 22, 2017 /	"I forgot to mention the Kimmelwich sandwich in the Park Café at lunchtime. To die for!!!!
Do not depend on the library for your reading material, hardly any books, If you bring some that you do not want to put in your luggage, leave them in the library, Its a quiet place to be."
4.0	Sail Date: Oct 22, 2017 /	"For reference, I'm a 50+ solo cruiser. This was my first RC cruise and my seventh cruise overall. The boat is very clean on par with Disney World. 

Food:
The food in the MDR is somewhat boring and not worth the hassle factor. My breakfast order was always incomplete. 
I did first night done right at Giovanni's Table. The food and service were excellent. Definitely worth a $15 up charge.
I had breakfast, lunch and dinner at Solarium Bistro. It's a great, quiet venue.
I had dinner at Sabor. The guacamole is made to order. Everything was good, and the service was great. It was worth the $19 up charge. I did the Windjammer a couple of times. The food is much better than what's offered in the MDR. However, there is a lot of action in the Windjammer( cruisers and staff and several food stations). 

Entertainment:
I love musicals and have seen three Broadway musicals in the past three years. I enjoyed Cats although I'm still trying to figure out what a jellicle cat is. Many people left at intermission. It is 2.5 hours long, so consider reserving the Saturday matinee. 

I enjoyed the ice show, the dive show, the headliner, and the family friendly version of the comedians. I caught the farewell parade which was lively and interesting.

Stateroom

 I had a balcony stateroom, which was a wonderful treat until the gentleman two cabins down started smoking on his balcony. I reported it to guest services, but I don't think they said anything to him because he continued to smoke on the balcony. I just went inside my cabin when he was smoking and flicking his ashes in the ocean. My stateroom steward was nice and did a good job.

Service:
Nothing to complain about. However, on other cruises, the staff often greeted me by name, made eye contact and seemed genuinely concerned. Service on the ship is effective but no staff member provided a memorable experience. 

Misc.

I enjoyed the Solarium area that is reserved for adults. Quiet, plenty of chairs and peace. There's a nice walking/jogging track on deck 5.

Final Thoughts:
RC does most things exceptionally well. I received good value for my money. I stepped off the boat well rested."
4.9	Sail Date: Oct 22, 2017 /	We will definitely be sailing on Oasis again in the future. Other than our issues with the photo CD we ordered, we didn't have a single problem. We thoroughly enjoyed ourselves and cannot wait to get back on Oasis.
5.0	Sail Date: Oct 22, 2017 /	It was a great week with friends. Lots to do but great options for personal space. Stress free cruise. Good excursions given the alternatives as the result of the hurricane. Ships captain was interactive and visible to guests.
5.0	Sail Date: Oct 22, 2017 /	What a great ship-so much to do. The crew was amazing and fun was had by All. LOVED deck 8 Central Park and Solarium. That’s where I spent most of my time. We had room 8100 OV and this room had a huge window. Mini fridge in room, outlet had three places for  electronics. There was an outlet by bed but I don’t find it until we were getting packed to leave. Food was amazing, we ate in the dining room every night. Lunch in solarium for less crowds. Wait staff were so great, Movino and Anthony were our dinner servers. We enjoyed them very much. Shows were fun!
3.6	Sail Date: Oct 22, 2017 /	The cruise itself and the ship were both great. Lots to do great staff and good food. My main complaint is precruise customer service. We saved up for this, our first cruise for awhile and picked this trip because we really wanted to go to two ports in particular to relive childhood memories. I understand that hurricane damage is not Royal Caribbean’s fault and they are allowed to change ports. My heart also goes out to the many people still suffering. However, Royal Caribbean’s complete lack of flexibility blew me away. When I asked if we could reschedule for a time in the future or get a discount for the huge change in itinerary I was basically told that they had the right to do whatever they wanted and there would be no compensation and my only remedy was to cancel with a 75% penalty. It took multiple calls just to get someone who did not have a bad attitude.
4.4	Sail Date: Oct 22, 2017 /	"My wife and I honestly did NOT like this cruise experience and will try avoiding this newer style of cruising on the larger ships.  Each cruise we eagerly anticipate great dining experiences, nightly shows, and adventures (off the ship) in a stress free environment.  We could eat well and see a show where we live, but we plan cruises to have those things brought to us without much thought on our part.  This was NOT the case on Oasis of the Seas.  We could go shopping anywhere and did NOT appreciate an the shopping ports.  We stopped cruising Royal Caribbean a few years back due to food quality going downhill and switched cruise lines.  Since we came back, we decided to upgrade our food this time with the ""Ultimate Dining Experience"" package.  Unfortunately, it was not well defined what we would get for paying so much extra.  Basically, we got 7 meals each (lunch or dinner but not both) at the specialty restaurants.  Overall, the food at the nicer restaurants was exceptional and worthy of a gormet restaurant.  It was well worth the extra money, but I was shocked that you still could be charged MORE money for certain foods (like lobster at Chops).  Also, the menu stayed exactly the same at each restaurant so if you went to Chops twice, the choices didn't change (unlike the typical dining room that varies their menus nightly).  Moreover, we were still asked to pay for drinks and tips at each restaurant on top of the standard daily gratuity charged on our cruise bill.   If you pay extra for the dining experience(s), I would highly advise you preserve your choices for dinners and only at the finer specialty restaurants like Chops, Giovanni's, 150 Central Park, and Izumi's, and MAKE your reservations early in your cruise to get the time you want.  The Solarium Bistro, Sabor, Johnny Rockets, and Boardwalk Dog House are lesser valued venues and probably a waste of a meal choice (choose to pay cash instead).  Regarding the entertainment, again we were disappointed with the very non-traditional, unstructured, and sometimes under-par entertainment.  Cats was amazing, but the hassle of booking tickets for each show and waiting in stand-by lines if not pre-planned was a hassle expecially since we were not properly informed of this new style of cruising when we initially boarded.  It can all be very confusing so passengers SHOULD be offered some type of concierge service (hint, hint: Royal Caribbean), so we do NOT have to worry about the hassles of planning the entertainment and pre-paid meals.  By the way, you can make reservations using your interactive cabin TV, but you can NOT cancel them.  It's a hassle to go to Guest Services or call the 7000 # only to be transferred, put on hold, and then told to call back when THEY'RE availabe. This whole aspect did not help to have a ""RELAXING"" experience. Other comments I have are regarding the internet service and soda package. Get the internet it if you want to use your phone or have internet access on the boat.  The speed was fast and useful if you have a Wi-Fi Calling capable phone.  Forget the old days of bringing Walkie-Talkies.  Also, they must have routers all over the ship because reception was good almost everywhere (except during heavy rain).  Regarding the soda package: it's a disgrace on many levels (besides the consumption of soda).  First, they give you ONE cup and no means of washing or sanitizing it during your week-long trip except by using the tiny bar soap in the cabin's tiny bathroom sink or shower.  Secondly, there were not nearly enough machines on the ship and if I wanted something to drink at night after your cup is empty, you have to exit your cabin and floor to find a working machine (Windjammer doors closed early or inbetween mealtimes) or a bar without being suffocated by smokers on deck.  For $70 the same cost as 3 dozen 2-liter bottles of Coke, I expect more convenience (like a machine on every deck) and less risk of bacteria.  Next time I'll pick up some bottled soda and water from Publix and save myself a fortune (from a possible hospital stay).  Royal Caribbean NEEDS to get a few self-contained cup washing stations near the Coke machines where someone can just place their cup and lid inside, have it go through a washing cycle and steam bath, and receive their sterilized cup back within seconds, BUT that would cost R.C. money, which won't happen until somebody gets SERIOUSLY sick and sues them.  Anyway, to conclude, my wife and I will be seeking a different experience for our next cruise.  It will be one that will have pre-planned nightly shows, include ports that don't focus mainly on shopping, and offers us more value with less extra charges. We'll also be packing our own beverages.  We will also be more informed BEFORE boarding as to what is or isn't available on-board so we're not surprised by entertainment (or lack of) and don't have to rely on uneducated staff to point us in the wrong direction."
4.7	Sail Date: Oct 22, 2017 /	Thoroughly enjoyed the ship and the people we met, both crew and guests. The crew were all friendly and approachable. The food was good and we tried all the places to eat.
3.8	Sail Date: Oct 22, 2017 /	Prefer smaller ships.  This confirms it.  Royal has some magnificent ships.  Their Quantam, Freedom, Voyager, and Vision Class ships are all wonderful.  We've sailed on all of them.  Oasis is marvelous, but not intimate.  Too big for my tastes.
4.3	Sail Date: Oct 22, 2017 /	Boardwalk Balcony cabin level 8 was a great location central to everything.  Don’t miss ice and aqua shows, zipline, trivia, Giovanni’s and Chops.  If you get Jermaine as your cabin steward, you’re in luck!  Have fun on the Oasis!
5.0	Sail Date: Oct 22, 2017 /	Everything was as expected and we booked a cruise on Symphony for 12/18 while on board. Falmouth was probably least favorite port but the ports were changed due to the hurricane damage in St Martin. We love St Martin and will go back next year
5.0	Sail Date: Oct 22, 2017 /	"This was my 5th cruise overall and the 4th with Royal Caribbean and it was amazing. 
-I'm a little confused why so many people are complaining about the ship being so busy and having to constantly wait in line...the most I ever had to wait for anything was an extra 30 seconds for another elevator to come because the one that stopped was full. Even then, that only happened maybe three times...if that. People fail to realize how many people are on that ship...I have waited longer in line at my local grocery store than I ever did on the ship. 
-The food...which was another popular complaint...was amazing. I never had something I didn't like. The windjammer food was obviously not as good as the main dining but thats to be expected and it still wasn't even bad. Its a buffet for crying out loud...what do people expect? 
-Getting on the ship on embarkation day took maybe 30 minutes from the time I parked my car in the terminal garage to the time I set foot on the boat. I will say...get there early because if you don't, it will take MUCH longer than that. My email said that boarding starts at 12 and when we arrived maybe 11:15 or so, there was already quite a few people there. Plan to be there early or expect to wait. That process is one of those things that just won't ever be quick. 
-Leaving the ship would have been a breeze if we didn't have issues with our picture CD...which I will elaborate on next.  We chose to do the self assist debarkation since our call time would have been 10am and we had a 6hr drive ahead of us. They told us the process would start at 6:45 and by 6:30 people were starting to exit the ship.  Had we not had the picture issue, we could have been off the ship by 6:45 based on where we were in line and how fast the line was moving.  
-Pictures...I am not docking the ship a star because it has nothing to do with the ship, its more ofa lack of communication and caring issue on the part of the photo lab employees. My husband and I ordered our photo CD the last night of the cruise and were told between 10:30-11pm the CD would be ready...well it wasnt. Then we were told that it would be delivered to the room...it wasn't.  We were then told that it would be ready when the photo lab opened at 7am the day we departed...and it wasn't. Finally they burned us a new CD but because we paid for the CD the night before when we originally ordered it, our account had a credit causing me not to be allowed off the ship. I went to guest services and got a new receipt showing a zero balance and the message still wasnt cleared so they weren't letting me leave.  They ended up just letting me go because they couldn't figure out how to clear the message that said I can't leave. My advice? Buy the CD on the first night and have it in hand, then as you take pictures throughout the cruise make sure they are added to your account via the kiosks. 

I am sure I forgot something but all in all it was an amzing experience. The issue with the pictures wasnt enough to take a star away, but I'll know next time not to wait til the last night to order it. 

Take negative reviews with a grain of salt. People love to complain...this is an amazing ship."
2.0	Sail Date: Oct 22, 2017 /	"This was our first time cruising with Royal Caribbean. I don’t think we’ll be sailing with them again. We paid for an eastern Caribbean tour but got a western tour because of the hurricanes. I understand that they can’t control Mother Nature but we paid more money for the trip we wanted and they are not willing to give us any credit back. 

We made reservations for a show every day. Most of them were pretty good. But the Come Fly With Me show just didn’t happen at all. We didn’t get any notice of the change. We had it booked for months before the cruise. And we didn’t know until we were seated in the theatre that there was a problem. It would have been nice to get a message in our state room messages beforehand so we could have done something else. 

We like to cruise because the food is always good and it’s always available. The food on RC was just ok. And the service just not good. With the exception of the dining room service which was good. At one time my husband was told they couldn’t serve the food until exactly opening time. The food was prepared and ready, the server was there ready to serve and they would not budge! They would not serve the food! 

And the photographers were so stiff. They make you pose in the same poses at every backdrop. They have no creativity! We bought the digital photo package which was great. We had 348 pictures and paid $266. (Usually they’re $20/each) Huge savings! But we had to keep checking every night to make sure our pictures were added to the disk. 

We checked our bill a few times during the cruise and everything was just as it should be. Then we got our bill on the last day and they charged us $50 for beach towels that were turned in after lunch on Saturday. So as we’re trying to get off the boat I had to wait in a 20 minute line to get that fixed. They gave me the credit right away but I had an early flight to catch so it just made more stress than necessary. 

The only reason I’m giving the boat 2stars is the value of photos and the Flow Rider! My husband loves the flow rider."
4.4	Sail Date: Oct 22, 2017 /	We had a wonderful time on our cruise, with beautiful weather and my daughter and me got to spend a lot of quality time together.  My husband enjoyed the peace and quite while we went to all the activities.  We always enjoyed our dinner together.  We were very well taken care of.
5.0	Sail Date: Oct 15, 2017 /	"I sailed with my girlfriend October of 2017. This was our second time on RC and first time on an Oasis class ship. We loved it! There was never a dull moment. 

Room:
Large interior. There was so much space. We were really happy that the shower had a door and not a curtain like Carnival. It was always clean and comfy. 

Food and drinks were excellent. We ate in the main dining room 5 out of 7 nights. We tried Sabor, the Mexican restaurant on the boardwalk. It was good. The buffet always had plenty of choices and there was sanitizer everywhere. We only had to wait to get in one day and that was brief. 

We also ate at the solarium bistro buffet a few times. I suggest heading there for lunch the day you board the ship. No lines. 

Shows were really good. We saw a few. 

Gym was way more than expected. We lift, and there were plenty of free weights to go around. 

The jogging track was the best I’ve ever seen on a ship. You can get there through the fitness center. I think it was either deck 5 or 6. We found ourselves on the track just relaxing. It’s super quiet and has areas with lounge chairs. This is probably the most private place on the ship besides your room. 

I did the teeth whitening at the spa. I waited until our last day sailing and the price went down by $99. It was effective. 

We stayed at the main pool or the solarium most of the time. That’s the best bet if you don’t want to be around kids or smoking. Occasionally there were kids by the main pool, but they mostly stayed in the kids pool or sports pool. There was also a whole deck that the teens spent most of their time at. 

The whirlpools were awesome. There were so many. 

Central Park was nice but we didn’t spend any time there, just walked through. 

The promenade was always really active. We hung out at Starbucks a lot and people watched. 

The dance club music was good!

The rest of the music was not my cup of tea. I expected some Caribbean music or more modern music. There was a lot of very old school country. 

I would definitely sail this ship again."
5.0	Sail Date: Oct 15, 2017 /	This was only my second cruise every and it was awesome.  The ship is huge and never felt too crowded even though it was full.  The shows were amazing, definitely do not miss them.  We ate at 3 specialty restaurants and they were all great but Giovanni’s was outstanding.  Great service everywhere but especially at guest services, every time I went there, the staff was so courteous and accommodating no matter what issues people were having.  Booked the Harmony for next year and looking forward to another great time with RC 😊😎
4.4	Sail Date: Oct 15, 2017 /	The Oasis is an amazing ship and is designed to make you feel like it is NOT crowded while there are over 6000 people on the boat.  The staff is great and really accommodating!
4.1	Sail Date: Oct 15, 2017 /	We have done over 75 cruises on 12 different cruise lines. We are diamond level with Royal.  We will NOT cruise on this ship again.  WAY too many people. Regardless of what they say, they cannot handle this many people in a comfortable manner.  If you enjoy standing in line, this is the ship for you.
4.6	Sail Date: Oct 15, 2017 /	We really had a great time with family making memories we will never forget.  The ship is huge and very full, food was nice and ship was very clean.  Thanks to the staff and the new friends we met.
4.6	Sail Date: Oct 15, 2017 /	This was a dream vacation for our family. There was always so much to do and enjoy. Oasis of the Seas is an incredible ship. There is just as much to do on the ship, as there is to do off of it. We can't wait to go again.  This was our children's first cruise. Now they can't wait to go again. Definitely worth it!!!!
5.0	Sail Date: Oct 08, 2017 /	Was our first time being on a ship and it was wonderful. The staff on this ship really made our cruise. Lots of entertainment and fun things to do. Love how there’s so much for kids to do.
4.5	Sail Date: Oct 08, 2017 /	Breathtaking views, Wonderful staff, and very relaxing. By taking my time dining, we weren't rushed to be anywhere at anytime. Oasis of the Seas is a huge ship, but very clean and once you figured out how to get around, it was easy.
4.4	Sail Date: Oct 08, 2017 /	We would do it again. Our food was good, The entertainment was top notch. We had the deluxe drink package and not all the bars did frozen drinks.  There are plenty of elevators to move you up and down between decks 3 and 15.
3.8	Sail Date: Oct 08, 2017 /	We had a great time. Our group always met at dinner at the main dining room an shared how we spent the day. Always had to careful on the pool decks.An don't really care for the walking path to be on deck 5.Not much to see but life boats
5.0	Sail Date: Oct 08, 2017 /	First time on RC and first time on Oasis. I hear lots of negatives and I cannot imagine why. This ship was amazing. The shows are ridiculously good. We watched all but Cats. Dont miss the dive show or headliner, the best.  The activities for the kids both in and out of kids club are awesome. We ate in every restaurant but Solarium and loved them all. Giovanni's Table and Russell our server were the best. MDR, windjammer and wipeout are more basic but still good. We ate a lot of specialty because we are foodies. MDR sit down breakfast was great.  Yes it is big, yes there are a lot of people but I never felt overwhelmed by the people at all. We had very little issues on this cruise at all. Disembarcation and embarcation were super smooth and quick too. It was me, my husband and 11 and 5 year old. We had a balcony room with pullout, midship 12th floor and loved it. Oceanview Balcony is a must.  Our room steward was awesome too.  As for activities we did ziplining, ice skating, putt putt, rock climbing, Finish the lyric game show, poker tournament, family scavenger hunts, carousel, kids activities on boardwalk, face painting, balloon twisting, ping pong, sports court, met all the characters, watched the parade and shows on the promenade and more.  You can lay on the pool deck all day and relax or you can get involved. Up to you.  There were tons of things we didn't do.  And my husband won another cruise to end the week on Saturday. We cannot wait to go back.
5.0	Sail Date: Oct 08, 2017 /	We really enjoy all that Royal Caribbean has to offer. Oasis is a magnificent ship will places, activities, shows and experiences for everyone. The ship never felt crowded and we would like to go again!
5.0	Sail Date: Oct 08, 2017 /	Incredible ship! We remained on the ship while in port since we had been to them before. This gave us more time to explore and enjoy the ship. Even so, we felt we just barely got to see it all.
4.0	Sail Date: Oct 08, 2017 /	Ship was amazing. Can definitely recommend the boardwalk balcony. We were in 10729 and the views were awesome. Only time noise was noticeable was aqua show. Food good. Drinks better. Only let down was the ports.
5.0	Sail Date: Oct 08, 2017 /	Very nice! Food was very good. Didn’t like slow evelators or the fact that deck five or deck 15/16 only had beverages,. We were on deck 11 and it was a bit of a hike for someone older.
4.5	Sail Date: Oct 08, 2017 /	Overall it was great!  Any 7 days on a cruise ship are going to be good as long as you make it.  There may have been a few hiccups, but it's all what you make of it.  Can't wait for our next cruise!
5.0	Sail Date: Oct 01, 2017 /	Absolutely love cruising with RC much better then Carnival Cruise! This ship is massive and well worth the price!! Will be back on this ship in October :)
5.0	Sail Date: Oct 01, 2017 /	We love Oasis for sure! We have another Cruise upcoming on her.  So much to do you can’t see it all in a week! Great for kids, families and adults of all ages!
3.0	Sail Date: Oct 01, 2017 /	"Just returned from oasis after a 7 day west Caribbean cruise.  Give yourself lots of boarding time as we took over an hour to get on once reaching the port. Very slow.  Ship was great and staff are for the most part excellent.  There are always a few bad apples but we just walk away. As a flow rider enthusiast, i was very disappointed in how early the ride is closed nightly.  With clear skies and beautiful evenings we had all hoped it would stay open for more fun but nope. 6 sometimes 7pm was it. If not for this ride I would not feel obligated to ride Royal Caribbean in the first place so I would love to see more adult time on these machines.  Having 2 did not ease the burden. 

Shows were awesome and American grill  was our dining choice.  Excellent food and our server made our week. Sad to leave him he was that much fun. Ibputu will forever be in our hearts."
3.4	Sail Date: Oct 01, 2017 /	With all the rerouting and cancellations it felt like the cruise should have never happened. However, we made the best of it and actually booked another cruise while on the ship
1.0	Sail Date: Oct 01, 2017 /	One wacky cruise we just experienced.  The ship is a floating city and beautiful.  But the amount of people on board make it seem small and crowded.  The venues are all too small for amount of people on board.  Not enough elevators. We spent post of our time either waiting on an elevator, or getting to a venue at least one hour early to get a seat, such as On Air for karaoke, StudioB for the Quest.  Not enough pools for amount of people.   One port was cancelled so we had 4 Sea days for 7 day cruise.  Pool areas were so crowded and pools so crowded, we only spent 3 hours total at the pool the  entire cruise.  It was not a stress free vacation.  It will be our last time on a mega ship.  Been there, done that.  The only thing we did really enjoy was the great service we got from our servers in dining room each night, and the our room steward was awesome.  Cruise director was the worst and other staff always seemed stressed or over worked.  Not worth the extra dollars RCCL charges for the mega ships in my opinion.
1.6	Sail Date: Oct 01, 2017 /	"A karaoke bar, the Open Air, where a staff member of Oasis of the Seas - mr. Webb, I guess Andrew Webb treated guests with disrespect, rudeness and discrimination. A horrible experience. I'll never recommend!
After several complaints, the entertainment manager said she'll definitely come back to this case and never did! Guests feedback don't matter for the staff! It looks like this company doesn't want to grow and improve the service experience for clients like me, who favorited Royal, took 3 Royal cruises for two years and stayed in Grand Suit.
I'll definitely won't recommend to anyone this cruise anymore till the guest service and the entertainment staff AT LEAST will take some classes of ETHICS, PSYCHOLOGY and HUMAN RELATIONS.
I already submitted the Royal survey and really hope this company will reflect on my comment! 
p.s. one positive take out from this cruise is a food quality is better than in Allure or Quantum."
4.7	Sail Date: Oct 01, 2017 /	wonderful boat! So big and so many things to do, we never got bored! We got a little special treatment for our honeymoon, which was so nice! Unfortunately, we  missed a port, but the staff always kept us informed about the boat's detour and provided additional entertainment.
4.9	Sail Date: Oct 01, 2017 /	This was our first Cruise, it was a little dramatic as we missed our first port of call Labadee due to a passenger falling I'll, we changed course to the Bahamas to meet Oasis sister Ship the Allure so the passenger could be transferred and brought back to port Canaveral. With Hurricane Nate cancelling Cozumel the Captain decided to change our return course and headed for Labadee, so it was not a total disaster port wise.Over all a fantastic experience, will definitely go again.
4.8	Sail Date: Oct 01, 2017 /	"Second time in a Central Park balcony cabin. The benefit is a free lunch in Giovanni's which we substitute for dinner. After being diverted to Nassau due to a passenger illness, we missed our first stop at Labadee but later in the week got there anyway because tropic storm Nate prevented the ship from going to Cozumel. So after Jamaica they doubled back to Labadee. Weather for the day on the beach was perfect.
The headliner this week was Savannah Jack. They played a variety of popular music and were one of the best headliners we have seen. It was so good we went to two shows."
3.4	Sail Date: Sep 24, 2017 /	"Over all the cruise was good
Weather was good only half day rain
Do wish that they would have given you time to  research the shore Excursion
The ice show was good cat's first part so so second part was better than the first"
4.2	Sail Date: Sep 24, 2017 /	NEVER AGAIN ON A MEGA SHIP..WE ARE VERY EXPERIENCED 30 + CRUISES..WILL STICK WITH SMALLER SHIPS..HAD TO SPEND $200 TO USE STEAM/SAUNA..PAINT CHIPPING..RUST..FILTHY CARPETS IN HALLWAY DECK 6..
4.4	Sail Date: Sep 24, 2017 /	We will do it again!! The ship itself, the staff, the food, the entertainment, everything was exactly the way it needed to be to provide a unique and wonderful experience.
3.7	Sail Date: Sep 24, 2017 /	Overall, we enjoyed the cruise because we made it enjoyable. The crew and staff can definitely improve their levels of service and pretend they care more about their guests.
4.0	Sail Date: Sep 24, 2017 /	Loved Oasis of the seas. Gorgeous ship food was GREAT. Service was wonderful especially my dining crew. WONDERFUL shows. I think the guys that were juggling was my favorite. Cats was long but I liked it. Oasis of dreams..... those divers are BRAVE and remarkable. Zip line was fun to do. We were able to find our way around her pretty easily after about a day or two. The Captain kept us very informed. Over all the ships crew was nice. Had one or two that were a little rude but I just ignored it because those people are doing their best with 6000 people and im sure they get frustrated under that stress. They work long hours as well. Had some issues with my time dining but they did their best to make sure we were happy. My real only negative is that you sometimes have to wait forever for elevators. Especially after shows or dinner. But again its 6000 plus people you are dealing with. Went to passion island in Cozumel. The speed boat ride to get there was AWESOME. The beach.... not really impressed. Was a lil dirty and l hurt my foot on something under the water when I was walking out into the water. Food there is pretty good though but they water down the drinks. Met a nice couple from Georgia and we sat and talked to them for most of our time there. The vendors there are a lil pushy and sell things that are over priced. Hope this helps someone. We had a wonderful time and slept in on most days. Would recommend Oasis to anyone. But she is a gigantic ship. We may try a smaller Royal ship next time.
3.6	Sail Date: Sep 24, 2017 /	Very disappointed we picked this cruise to go to the original ports and paid more on these port charges, then redirected to cheaper over crowded ports and there were no other options or compensation offered. Would not have booked had we known.
3.0	Sail Date: Sep 24, 2017 /	"entertainment was great food was great was not very impressed with the ship
the soda package was not worth it  look up was expensive
 what is free on princess you have to pay for here"
5.0	Sail Date: Sep 24, 2017 /	Even though we were re-routed to Cozumel and Costa Maya we didn't mind the change. We just needed the time together and we love cruising! I have been on 1 Carnival Cruise with a poor experience. Highly recommend RC for all your Cruising needs. We are taking our daughters and my parents for Spring Break on the Majesty. This will be our 2nd time on that ship.
5.0	Sail Date: Sep 24, 2017 /	Had very good cruise ship was outstanding very big with 6000 people didn’t feel crowded at all the staff are very nice and friendly the shows were outstanding
5.0	Sail Date: Sep 24, 2017 /	We board the Oasis. Itinerary has changed due to Hurricanes but we are cool with that. This will be my 3rd Cruise. 1 with Carnival (didn't enjoy), 2 with RC (this one included). This is my hubby's 2nd Cruise (both with RC). I've heard great things ab this ship! We are excited! Happy Cruising!!!!
5.0	Sail Date: Sep 17, 2017 /	I would recommend a cruise to anyone that wants a real relaxing vacation. This was the first vacation that we have ever been on the we came back feeling relaxed. There was no work!!! It is all done for you.
4.0	Sail Date: Sep 17, 2017 /	Overall, we had a lovely and relaxing week.  We will definitely cruise again but probably not on an Oasis class ship.  Ship was nice and the food was good but the service was not as good as we have experienced with other cruise lines.
4.6	Sail Date: Sep 17, 2017 /	It was magical!! First time on this cruise and I was so amazed and excited. Everyone is friendly, you don't run out of things to do. It's worth every single penny.
4.9	Sail Date: Sep 17, 2017 /	Great cruise. Would recommend this ship to everyone. The weather was awesome the whole time we was on and off the ship.  Hope everyone going on the Oasis from here on out is enjoying it as much as my wife and I did.
4.0	Sail Date: Sep 17, 2017 /	"We had a great time on the Oasis. The crew were very much about taking care of everyone. Even when I did not understand a cost (my fault), RC took it off of my bill when I questioned it. I do not believe the ultimate dining package is worth it. Soboro and Giovanni's were big disappointments; Izumi only had sushi included in the package. The was an extra charge for hibachi. If you want this package, wait until you get on board as you will still get the discounted prices on the packages. 

150 Central and Chops were excellent. Ask for Mehi in 150 as the personalized service was phenomenal. 

The ultimate drink package was well worth it. Get coffee at cafe promenade, bottle water everywhere and of course the drinks. If you can find Anthony on deck 15 at one of the pool bars. he understands that there are working men and women on vacation and truly knows how to make the drinks. 

Be aware that any food on a menu that has a price by it, means it is an extra cost and is not included in any package. 

American Icon (regular dining) was just fine for dinner. Breakfast in the windjammer is way better than anywhere else on the boat. Lunch is great in windjammer also. 

This was our first cruise so I hope this provides some tidbits for the new cruisers."
5.0	Sail Date: Sep 17, 2017 /	No one ever really reviews their Star Class experience or genie reviews, so I figured I would. From the minute we showed up at the port we were treated like gold. Our luggage was handled and escorted to the lounge. I called our genie, Allan Fajardo who came down and escorted us to our room. We were in our suite enjoying hoursdouvers and champagne by 11 am. Allan then went over our entire itinerary for the week and wanted to know if any changes needed to be made. He made sure we had reservations for every specialty restaurant and show, personally saved us our front row seats and made sure that we had drinks. He provided us with his phone number and a link to text him any time we needed.  We dined with skstokes(that we met on this site).  During dinner, there was a small issue with the restaurant.   We sent Allan a text and he was at our table in less than 10 minutes to correct the problem.  Allan is by far the best genie the company has and goes above and beyond to keep his guests happy.  I however in no way want to leave out our room attendants, Cami and Afonso were wonderful. They kept my room stocked with my favorite beer on ice everyday.  My wife mentioned to Allan that she loved brie and that my son liked a certain cookie. He made sure that there was always a tray of brie and the chef made my son a dozen cookies and had it sent to the room every day. I don't want to ramble on but if you ever get the opportunity to sail under Star Class do it.  We had the time of our lives and thanks again to Allan, Cami and Aphonso... you guys are the best.
4.1	Sail Date: Sep 17, 2017 /	We are quiet cruisers, who like to relax, it the lounges, and play games we bring or read.    We were always able to find a quiet spot and an open bar, although none with outside views. :(
3.0	Sail Date: Sep 17, 2017 /	Cabin 9329 the last cabin on port side great view boardwalk,ocean,and aqua theater. Down side extremely noisy during football games and some movies. Guest services said to call if drunk football fans get out of control. I think they should have security watching after 11pm.
3.0	Sail Date: Sep 17, 2017 /	"Good.
We just got back from our cruise on Big O. Great food, entertainment, great check in and debarkation. We were onboard in less than 15 minutes from parking to boarding and off the ship by 6:30 AM.
Bad
The online check in was unnecessarily drawn out. I am use to being able to book and being completely done with paperwork and having luggage tags and boarding pass in hand in less than 15 minutes.
I am glad we sailed the Big O, but it was a bit intimidating in size. The main buffet is only open certain times of the day. I realize this is probably by design.
Now this is my biggest grip. On Saturday in America it is time for college football. I could not find a single TV anywhere on that massive ship that was carrying college football on Saturday afternoon. I don't care about cricket or soccer. I realize a large number of the staff is from India, but they are there to serve the passengers. A very small number of the passengers were from India. I called Guest Services and the Indian lady told me they did not have the license to carry college football. I guess she must have ment during afternoon hours. At 7:30 PM they started showing football on ESPN2. 
Anyway, it was a great cruise other than that. I might be tempted to cruise Royal Caribbean again, but it will be awhile."
5.0	Sail Date: Sep 10, 2017 /	Ship and crew were great. Something to do around the clock. Enough to do for the entire family. We had a great time trying to do all the plan activities.
5.0	Sail Date: Sep 10, 2017 /	We were bummed our cruise got shortened due to Irma, but the service, experience, and amenities were fantastic! So much to do, we couldn't fit everything in. Can't wait for our next cruise!
5.0	Sail Date: Sep 10, 2017 /	Had a fantastic time.   The wait staff, bartenders, piano players, events staff, Cruise Director, the Captain, all the way down the line everyone was fantastic.
3.1	Sail Date: Sep 10, 2017 /	Completely heartbroken! I feel we should have been given a partial refund with 100% credit given towards another cruise. I have been looking forward to going for years.
3.2	Sail Date: Sep 10, 2017 /	Food quality, and guest service could improve , no much attention  to details.  cruise activities could improve as well. shows compare to carnival cruise must improve
4.4	Sail Date: Sep 10, 2017 /	The Oasis of the Seas was the best ship we have been aboard thus far.  Lots to see and do for the entire  family. Entertainment, relaxation something for all of us.
4.6	Sail Date: Sep 10, 2017 /	Loved it!  Great shows and other activities for all ages.  You could do as much or as little as you liked.   Miss the fact that cruise ships do not do the midnight buffets or ice sculptures anymore.   Would definitely recommend to others.
5.0	Sail Date: Sep 03, 2017 /	This is not my first cruise on the Oasis and it is a beautiful vessel. First time is was the husband and I this time we are cruising with the kids. Ages 19, 15, and 13. Cant wait.
4.0	Sail Date: Sep 03, 2017 /	As an adult, it was a lot of fun. I met some people using this app and hung out with them almost every night after dinner. The daytime activities were fun. I did a lot of sporting competitions which allowed me to meet even more fun people. The only complaint I have is that the nightlife sucked. Blaze's DJs were terrible and the dance floor was not appealing. I was not impressed but Baleros was OK. The ship itself was amazing.
4.7	Sail Date: Sep 03, 2017 /	over all great cruise, we loved the ship, food, and staff, We would do it again. Only gripe was our cabin was loud at times, and the lines for the buffet were long at times
5.0	Sail Date: Sep 03, 2017 /	Cruise was a wonderful experience had a great time and was treated quite royally.  Had extra trip to Costa Maya because of hurricane Erma and we were assured often that we were safe.
5.0	Sail Date: Sep 03, 2017 /	OMG, perfect, incredible, amazing! not enough words to describe how great it was! Royal Caribbean kept us safe and entertained through 3 extras days because of Irma. The ship was beautiful, entertainment non stop and the crew was fantastic. The service on the MDR was perfect every night (we had my time, and different tables), servers were nice, atentive, fast, interested but not interrupting. Food, not so great, but the desserts were really good (creme brulee, pavlova, chocolate cookie, do try!). Love and marriage game, The Quest and Majority Rules were so much fun. Even with 10 days onboard we didn't get to eat/do/drink everything everywhere. The spetialty dining was no big deal though, not worth the money because the MDR was so good already. No crowds, no lines, no problems, just pure happiness and relaxation!!! thanks Royal Caribbean and Oasis of the Seas crew  ❤❤❤
5.0	Sail Date: Sep 03, 2017 /	Royal Caribbean had excellent service. They kept us safe during hurricane Irma. Oasis crew handled everything amazingly. We had a few extra days aboard but offered free Wifi and 50% off drink packages and specialty restaurants.
5.0	Sail Date: Sep 03, 2017 /	Had a wonderful time. Thanks to Irma we had a three day extended cruise. Went from a seven day cruise to a 10 day cruise. Royal Caribbean didn't awesome job to keep us safe. Thank you capt. Per and Royal  Caribbean
4.3	Sail Date: Sep 03, 2017 /	I am glad I went on the cruise but I will never do a big ship again.  It would be great for a family with many different age groups because there is definitely something for everyone to do.
4.8	Sail Date: Sep 03, 2017 /	Because of Irma, we stayed 2 days in Cozumel, one day in Costa Maya (great place, beautiful!), and one extra sea day on our way back. They kept us safe, informed and entertained. It was more than I could ever imagine, perfect, fantastic cruise. The crew makes all the difference, and the ship is just incredibly fun. So much to do, to eat, to drink, to watch, to feel. Loyal to Royal after this!!
4.9	Sail Date: Sep 03, 2017 /	It was an amazing cruise , great ship and fantastic crew!!!   Our cruise was extended an additional three days do to Hurricane Irma! Thank RC for keeping us safe!!!
4.4	Sail Date: Sep 03, 2017 /	"Our captain kept us informed of hurricane Irma each day and was very concerned about our safety. We loved American Icon restaurant for dinner each night our wait staff was Emanuel and he was awesome.  He and his partner after the first night new what we wanted to drink called us by name and suggested things for us to try
We also visited Costa Maya which we loved. It was clean and the people were very friendly. it seemed more like a village and the people did not pressure you to buy from them."
5.0	Sail Date: Aug 27, 2017 /	Oasis of the Seas, my favorite ship in fleet. Cats is best!!! Aqua/Ice shows it has it all. Food is as good on Oasis as all the other Royal Caribbean ships.
4.0	Sail Date: Aug 27, 2017 /	"Everything from start to finish was great , we felt so welcomed and spoiled 
So many activities for kids over 3 , the shows were amazing .
I want to point out our stateroom attendant Iputu ,who was working so hard to make us happy and comfortable , thank you 
Also the staff at the main dining room made our dinners fun , and enjoyable , we never wanted to cancel dinner even when we were so full 
We didnt get to any specialty restaurant as we were good with the park cafe on deck 8 for lunch as they had lots of healthy options , windjammer had good variety too
For breakfast my favorite was the windjammer 
Also we did breakfast with dream works characters , it was so much fun for   Adults and kids , adults order from the kids menu as it has so much fun breakfast items 
I have few things that bothered me though 
The rooms needed maintenance especially the couches and bathrooms 
Also the rooms needed to be vented somehow as after 4 days we started smelling mold 
Other thank that everything was great and smooth 
Thank you royal Caribbean for the great experience"
2.0	Sail Date: Aug 27, 2017 /	Charging a delivery fee for room service cabin steward not very good ship has never seemed so crowded food selection in main dining room poor windjammer same thing every day third time on the oasis
3.7	Sail Date: Aug 27, 2017 /	too crowded too many kids.
4.0	Sail Date: Aug 27, 2017 /	Our state room attendant was great Damian Facey I'll give him 11 stars and dining room servers where good. The ship was very clean but starting to show age (doors hard to open, some sliders would not open all the way). Food was below average.  Bar staff not very friendly. If you book a excision on the boat do not take there advice.
5.0	Sail Date: Aug 27, 2017 /	Wow an amazing ship for being 9yrs old its barely noticeable. Only area I could see age was in our cabin carpet and hall carpets to rooms. Very well kept ship, food was very good Chops,150 Giovanna table were all execellent. Jap hibachi was good time as well. Felt crowded very little aboard and all the amenities and things to do can keep you very busy. We had no issues at all, windjammer has excellent dessert variety. Lots of places to have breakfast check your daily compass, all a little different menu. You will have a great time aboard I would sail her again for sure.
4.0	Sail Date: Aug 27, 2017 /	Big ship, good amenities but felt overcrowded, would prefer smaller less crowded for our next cruise vacation. Food was awesome, you can preorder on day 1 if u want any particular kind of cuisine for future days.
5.0	Sail Date: Aug 27, 2017 /	Loved oasis. I really have nothing extremely negative to say about my last week except the buffet was quite aggravating and not extremely tasty. But what do you expect on a ship of more than 5000 people? Plenty of other food options. (I'd be lying if I didn't mention that I wish the ice cream machine was open 24/7 lol) Also lots of walking, such a big ship! Totally recommend the drink packages (we did the non alcohol packages as we aren't drinkers) you get a special cup to use with Coca-Cola machines. And unlimited water bottles were nice to hoard them in our room!  Room service food was surprisingly extremely tasty. Dining room was fast service and good food. We did my time dining, arrived a little late most nights but we were seated instantly at the same private table every night. Loved getting to know our waiter, Jarvis-really awesome guy! Johnny rockets best breakfast on the ship! Plenty of hot tubs. Pool wasn't big enough but are any of them? Solarium for 16+ is such a great addition to the ship. After being at home for 4 hours I already miss the clean stateroom, made bed and clean towels every time I walk back into our room (thanks to Vincent!) super friendly crew members, loved our chats with them. They sure know what they are doing! As always I recommend a balcony room. I also wish an app was available for oasis, it was a great help on our carnival cruise last year. Boarding and exiting the ship was organized and fast-we didn't wait in a line AT ALL for boarding or exiting. Amazing considering the number of people?! So many things to do but we missed 4/5 of our booked shows because I tend to fall straight to sleep on cruises after dinner lol Pure relaxation! 110% will sail oasis and RCI again. Oh and don't worry about the number of people, they really are spread out because of the size of the ship.
4.0	Sail Date: Aug 27, 2017 /	The ship was absolutely amazing. It was a little too big with 6k but never felt over crowded unless there was a party in the Royal Promenade.  I would definitely sail this ship again.
5.0	Sail Date: Aug 27, 2017 /	It was my first cruise. Can't wait for my next one. Enjoyed all the shows the food was excellent. Zip lining was so much fun. The parades were fun to to watch. Loved having Starbucks on the ship. Played minuture golf. Hit the candy store every day. Bought some gifts in the gift shop. My cabin was just right. Loved the window seat facing Central Park.
4.5	Sail Date: Aug 27, 2017 /	"Cruising with royal Caribbean was a blast , lots of fun , lots of great food and lots of spoiling 
Everyone was welcoming and helpful, the excursions were well organized, thanknyou royal Caribbean again for the great experience"
5.0	Sail Date: Aug 20, 2017 /	My wife and I had an AWESOME time on OOTS! Big ships aren't for everyone, but I encourage everyone to try it at least once and be opened minded! They're not that bad! Happy cruising!
4.6	Sail Date: Aug 20, 2017 /	All in all was a really enjoyable cruise. I'd have to say the Oasis class ships are my favorite. They're not for everyone but if you enjoy the bigger boats, definitely have to check out any of them in this class!
3.0	Sail Date: Aug 20, 2017 /	First time on a Royal ship and I'm not sure I'd cruise with them again. The boat is very large and has many amenities. Lots to do in such a small amount of time. No issue with the vessel. My problem was the staff onboard. They were very nonchalant when issues arose. Did not offer any help, lied to the cruisers numerous times, treated the passengers horribly. I just think that some staff members need more training on how to deal with issues that may happen on a boat this size with The possibility of anything happening. The kids club staff was not great with the kids either. The way they interacted with them was not acceptable for me. I've been on other boats where my son wanted to spend every waking hr in kids club. This one he screamed if mentioning the kids club.
3.0	Sail Date: Aug 20, 2017 /	"Total Eclipse Cruise was great, but RCL needs to figure out how to eliminate the problem we had in Nassau.  It was a short day and we had to be back on the ship at 2:30.  Apparently everyone came back right before the deadline and the line ran the length of the pier and more.  It was a hot, humid, sunny day in Nassau and we all (elderly, pregnant ladies, children, etc.) had to tough it out in the very uncomfortable conditions with no shade or no alternative.  

RCL loves those HUGE ships with thousands of passengers padding the profits for RCL, but MUST find ways to eliminate this kind of situation - rain, storm, heat, cold - we had to wait in line for security before we could board.  Without a solution RCL might see those profits from huge ships dwindle while passengers opt for smaller ships.

I think RCL should cough up the dollars to help ports like Nassau upgrade the security facilities to accommodate the huge passenger numbers.  The Port of Nassau didn't create the problem, but the captain on the pier (not THE Captain, but one of four on Oasis) was quick to blame the port for the security backlog. He accepted no blame for RCL."
4.5	Sail Date: Aug 20, 2017 /	This was the total eclipse of the sun cruise.  RCL dd it right!!!!  We had no problems on the cruise.  The food and the entertainment were excellent.  We love Central Park and Boardwalk.  The Aqua show was about the best we have seen onboard  Oasis class ships.
5.0	Sail Date: Aug 20, 2017 /	We had a wonderful vacation!  We are definitely going to be booking another cruise with RCI in the near future!  I've cruised with Carnival in the past and RCI and hands down, RCI is the epitome of classy!
5.0	Sail Date: Aug 20, 2017 /	Took the Total Eclipse Cruise on RC and had a great time. Good weather, awesome view of the eclipse, they actually stopped the ship in the middle of the ocean, and a very enjoyable time. Met lots of great folks. Food was great. Staff was very friendly and helpful. Beautiful ship with lots to do. Read lots of stuff on-line so knew to make reservations prior to boarding. After reading a lot of the reviews I think people should realize that it might be a vacation but that doesn't negate your responsibility as a human being and realizing that you are fully capable of making decisions and taking care of yourself. The crew is not your personal servant and are doing their job. No matter where you go on vacation there are going to be lines and wait times unless you are staying in a yurt in the middle of nowhere. The one thing I did that I think worked out the best was planning my own excursions. They were cheaper and didn't have the massive crowds that the ship excursions had. They also realize where their paycheck comes from and get you back to the ship in plenty of time. I would cruise on the Oasis of the seas again, I had a wonderful experience.
5.0	Sail Date: Aug 20, 2017 /	Beautiful ship, very friendly service from everyone. Captain took us out to see the total eclipse. The solarium pool and hot tubs were great if you don't have kids. There were a lot of families with kids at the other pools and hot tubs and they all seemed to having a blast. Mo5aic was the headliner show, they were amazing!! The ice  skating show and the diving (oasis of dreams) show were both amazing too. Would recommend this cruise ship to anyone
3.2	Sail Date: Aug 20, 2017 /	I would travel on RC again, but not on one of the mega ships.  Also, I would avoid Nassau and St. Marteen (unless you go to the French side of the island).
5.0	Sail Date: Aug 20, 2017 /	Our first cruise, Total Eclipse Cruise, and the most amazing experience ever. RCI defiantly goes over and above our expectations. Hooked on cruising !
5.0	Sail Date: Aug 13, 2017 /	Great ship. Lots to do.  Food and staff was great.  Room was nice.  Shows were great.  Even enjoyed Cats.  Didn’t get to do the zip line.  Wish I had.
5.0	Sail Date: Aug 13, 2017 /	Always delightful and exciting. I am loyal to Royal!!
4.9	Sail Date: Aug 13, 2017 /	It was an amazing family experience!! We took our kids and grandkids and made many memories! Hope to go again someday! I will be looking forward to sailing on the new Symphony of the Seas!
4.7	Sail Date: Aug 13, 2017 /	Overall Cruise was good little long on the ocean some of the port of calls the locals were very pushy on trying to sell their products to the cruise lines which I understand that's part of their business but they should be controlled little bit better when snorkeling at labardini and we were approached while snorkeling by one of the sales people there that wanted to sell us some of the locally made products they were interrupting the Excursion
4.9	Sail Date: Aug 13, 2017 /	All I can say is excellent. We usually travel the NCL but the RC is now our ship for cruising. The RC has gone up and beyond my expectations. The cruise director Tim was fantastice. He can make a party and from his actions will make you want to dance
3.1	Sail Date: Aug 13, 2017 /	Service, service, service – above all else Cruising is about impeccable service. In my life, I’ve cruised four times with Carnival, Norwegian and now twice on Royal Caribbean. I’m sad to say my experience on the Oasis of the Seas has been my most disappointing cruise, especially in terms of service. I think this will be my last time of RC.
4.0	Sail Date: Aug 13, 2017 /	"Currently on the Aug 13th sailing of Oasis.  We arrived at the port at 1130am...boarded by noon...easy check in. When we first boarded, we were way overwhelmed... couldn't figure out where we boarded, where anything was, and as soon as you step aboard, they're already trying to sell you everything...dinner packages, beverage packages, and internet. It was a little stressful. we walked around, and by 1pm, the rooms were ready.  They were already starting to deliver bags.  I made the mistake of being outside my cabin when the guy delivered my bags...he was waiting for a tip which i gave him...but had i been inside cabin or not there,  no tip would be given..not sure what the protocol is for that. Tipped our steward 50 bucks when we saw him... not sure if it did much...he was nice and cleaned our rooms well but not sure if it made a difference. 

Ok.. the food...so far we ate at Chops, Giovannis, Izmir the hibatchi place, and  main dining room for dinner....the food has been really really outstanding. Wasn't expecting much,  but wow...very impressed. Also, the service has been more than you could ask for in every dining area.. very fun crew. 

The ship is huge... Lots to explore and walk around. To be honest,  i thought the pools would be bigger..although there were multiple pools, they were always jammed with people... the hot tubs were great though.  I think my kids wpuld prefer Harmony or Allure for water slides.. but still was great.

Our ports were St Maartin, San Juan and Labadee. We did Maho beach in St Maartin which is amazing.. tiny beach but you got to go there.  We did San Juan today, our beach excursion got cancelled due to heavy rain,so we just walked around old san juan... wish we had more time and better weather.  Tomorrow is Labadee..hopefully we have better weather. 

Let me know if you have any questions."
4.0	Sail Date: Aug 13, 2017 /	This ship I have to say is breathtaking and so beautiful. I was fascinated with the look, Central Park, Boardwalk the whole thing. I even loved that it has a Starbucks. But from someone that does Carnival as well it lacks the party scene if you are looking forward to that on this ship. The water shows are great but we fell asleep with Cats. It was so long and we ended up leaving. There were times we would walk around saying what should we do. The food is over the top. We loved it. So many things to choose from and I like that they cater to everyone.
4.0	Sail Date: Aug 06, 2017 /	Before sailing on Oasis I was concerned about the number of people.... people everywhere, causing us to spend way too much time in lines or difficulty in getting seats at shows or other venues - it wasn't a problem. In face this was our best Royal Caribbean cruise and our teen boys had a blast.... and they refuse to go to the teen club. Embarkation was a snap.... only waited for a few minutes, it was well organized. Food was good... well, except for the chocolate chip cookies. Don't let the size full you the ship had lots of places to relax away from the crowds and head a very good flow to it.  We enjoyed it so much we're booked a cruise on sunset Allure OTS while onward.  Happy cruising!
4.2	Sail Date: Aug 06, 2017 /	Great cruise with nice ports and completely able to design your vacation the way you want. Wonderful staff that go out of there way to make your trip a memorable one.
5.0	Sail Date: Aug 06, 2017 /	"The Oasis is amazing ! The staff was so welcoming all over the ship, they really went above and beyond to make the cruise memorable and it was !!!

The shows were really great (cats was disappointing though) make sure before cruise you make reservations for all shows!! 

The food was really good considering you are on a ship with over 5k ppl

The Solarium was our favorite spot, with one small pool and two small jacuzzis and two big jacuzzis on the side entrance of solarium!!

Lots of activities you just need to keep track of the times and where, lots to do zip line, ice skating, surfing, rock climbing, etc ...

If you a drinker get the package it was worth it !! 

It never felt crowded only at the safety briefing cause everyone left at the same time once it was over !

I can't wait to book another cruise on allure or Harmony even back to oasis !

I have been to more than 10 cruises and never had a bad time, it's my favorite vacation and oasis it's right at the top !"
5.0	Sail Date: Aug 06, 2017 /	"Awesome ship! Best one yet! Lots to see and do. Never felt like there were 6K other cruisers. Pool deck gets crowded on sea days, but lots of other activities around ship. Great Boardwalk for kids activities. ALL entertainment and shows were superb. 
We LOOOOOOOVE our cabin steward- O'Neil Orr and his friend Damion. 
Super clean. Never felt threatened. Certainly never hungry and super happy that we bought the drink package. Although we are not big drinkers, we had fun and believe that this was a wise decision."
4.8	Sail Date: Aug 06, 2017 /	Great time! Kids said the only thing that would have been better would be that there were more Coca Cola pop machines; they were always looking for them
4.8	Sail Date: Aug 06, 2017 /	Oasis is a huge, beautiful ship with plenty to do. Never really felt too crowded, considering how many were on board. Food was very disappointing. Have to go to the specialty restaurants to get good food, but after paying the cruise fare, I expect descent food.
3.7	Sail Date: Aug 06, 2017 /	"The ship was magnificent. The food & service was incredible. The entertainment was spectacular. The stateroom was very comfortable. The only thing that will keep me from booking again on a large ship again is waiting in lines for everything only to find out that if you didn't already have a reservation you could not go in! That was for ""my time dining"" & all the shows. (And we were just a party of two. I'd hate to hear how long a larger party had to wait. Probably had to eat in the Windjammer every night)  I'm going to stick with the smaller ships for my next cruise"

3.6	Sail Date: Jul 30, 2017 /	Would love to go again and try a different boat and see more ports! Renting a scooter is a must for a boat this big and people with mobility issues. The solarium was nice and peaceful. Need more freestyle machines!
4.9	Sail Date: Jul 30, 2017 /	Wonderful Cruise line with great staff and fun activities.  We had the best time and never had to worry about anything while on the cruise  and will be back
4.6	Sail Date: Jul 30, 2017 /	This was our first cruise and we decided to go on the Oasis for our honeymoon. We had such an amazing time and absolutely loved the ship! Next time we will plan out what all we would like to do on the ship during the week when we first get there so we don't run out of time like we did. We ended up not getting to do everything we wanted due to time. The entertainment was awesome! We went to every show that requires a reservation except Cats. We loved Park Cafe and Sorrentos pizza. My husband is a vegan and the Main Dining Room was very accommodating to his diet needs. They made him an appetizer, main dish and dessert each night. After the first night eating at the MDR we were told to be there every night for the week at 5pm so we could get the same table and my husband would get his vegan meals. We already had other reservations times based on our shows and activities at ports. 5:00 pm was too early for us to eat each night, so next time we will do our dining differently.  We absolutely loved our waitress Floribeth and waiter Sebastio in the MDR! All of the food was delicious. We loved the hot tubs at night. This was our first cruise but won't be our last!
4.8	Sail Date: Jul 30, 2017 /	We had a great cruise.  This was our 11th cruise but first cruise on Royal Caribbean and it was pure pleasure.  We have always been fans of NCL, but the entertainment and service on this boat were second to none.   The ship itself was beautiful.  Never felt crowded even with 6500+ passengers on board.  Between the Promenade, Central Park, the Boardwalk and the pool areas, the common areas were just beautiful.  No complaints about the food. but high compliments to the wait staff and to the cabin steward.  We had a great time.
4.0	Sail Date: Jul 30, 2017 /	"The ship is beautiful, but we won't be going on it again.
Nothing against the Oasis but my husband and I felt it was too big for our taste.  
The staff was good, the food was amazing in the dining room and the windjammer.  Don't understand why the windjammer doesn't open for dinner until 5:30p but I guess that is their time 
Did not like having to pay extra for almost everything!  They close the ""free ice cream stations at 6p"" BUT you can PAY to eat Ben and Jerry""
Had to a ""free lunch"" to Johnny Rockets but then had to pay for the milkshakes and they don't tell you in advance???
The wifi was good (but for$113) for 7 days it better be!"
5.0	Sail Date: Jul 23, 2017 /	This is a fun ship. There is always something to do, and since it is so big, it's always an adventure finding new things. Make sure you sign up for shows prior to your cruise if you can.
5.0	Sail Date: Jul 23, 2017 /	First time cruising with RC in the Oasis of the Seas. We traveled with three daughters all different ages. We all had a great time. Plenty to do for all. Definitely book your shows in advance. All of the shows were great! We booked our 20th anniversary trip in the Symphony of the Seas for 2019! Can't wait!
5.0	Sail Date: Jul 23, 2017 /	This is a wonderful ship and can’t wait to sail on Oasis again. Cats was wonderful, long show but worth it. The medical facility is state of the art and the staff is very professional. We unfortunately had to use it on The third day of the cruise. The treatment we were given was the best ever. The treatment my husband received saved his condition from becoming any worse than it was.
5.0	Sail Date: Jul 16, 2017 /	just got back from our vacation on the oasis! she is a beauty. I don't have any complaints. there was so much to do every second of the day. we loved it so much we will be back on the ship next October! def our favorite ship.
4.6	Sail Date: Jul 16, 2017 /	The entire cruise was great. Fast service and easy to get on and off the boat. Staff were all friendly and helpful. Food was good and ship was clean. Lots of fun things to see and do on the ship.
5.0	Sail Date: Jul 16, 2017 /	Our waiter and his team are great!  They accommodated our requests.  They were pleasant, couteous and has sense of humor. Thye were very efficient.  They did their best to make each night a wonderful experience.
5.0	Sail Date: Jul 16, 2017 /	"Although I have previously sailed on The Oasis of the Seas and her sister ship, The Allure of the Seas, when I was invited to a ship tour of The Oasis, I jumped at the opportunity.  After parking in the Employee Parking Lot directly across from Terminal 1, I joined the line of travel agents for Check In.  In addition, there was a wedding party also waiting to join the ship for the day.  It took quite awhile to get our driver's licenses substituted for a lanyard with our boarding card.  

When everyone had arrived, thirty to forty of us, we were divided into three groups.  I was in the group led by Joanne of RCCL.  Before long, we quickly went through Security and boarded the ship on Deck 5.  Joanne led us at a steady pace and we took an elevator  to Deck 17.  On this deck were the suites that I was looking forward to seeing.  Our first stops were at the Royal Loft Suite, 1744 & Crown Loft Suite, 1708.  Then we visited a Boardwalk Balcony room, 9701, Aqua Theater Suite (2 BR) #9730, followed by Grand Suite, 9660, Royal Family Suite, 9644, Central Park Window, 9593 and an Inside Stateroom.  All the rooms were well appointed and lovely. Since we boarded before the stewards had time to complete their cleanings, we were able to these and many other staterooms not on our official list.    

After the stateroom visits, we toured the Neighborhoods of the ship.  When we passed the Wipe Out Cafe, we stopped for an ice cream cone but kept on walking while we ate.   Our tour included Central Park, Boardwalk including taking a carousel ride, Promenade and the  Entertainment Place.  I noticed that the Donut Shop was replaced by Boardwalk (Hot) Dog House and a new restaurant was in boardwalk.    We also visited the Opal Theater, AquaTheater, Studio B Ice-Skating Theater, Solarium Pool, Sports Pool and Beach Pool.  We peeked into many of the lounges, bars and alternative restaurants along the way.  Joann didn't waste a minute during the tour.  

Just as we started getting a bit tired, it was time to join the group for lunch.  Instead of dining in the Main Dining Room, we had a buffet set up for us at the Blaze Nightclub.  The buffet included refreshments, a wide variety of Hors D'oeuvres and a dessert bar.  Although most of our group left the ship after lunch, I continued on visiting those parts of the ship not covered on the tour.  I visited the two Flow Rider, Zip Line, The Windjammer, Main Dinning Room, Casino and the Rising Tides Bar.  All too soon it was time to leave the ship.

It was a fun but tiring day and I loved every minute of it.  The ship is maintained well - everything is bright, cheerful and shiny.  The food was delicious and the staff was helpful, friendly and professional.  Now that The Oasis is home ported in my local port, Port Canaveral, there will be many opportunities for me to sail on my favorite ship again."
4.7	Sail Date: Jul 16, 2017 /	Oasis of the Seas is a huge ships with lots of options and you shouldn't be bored on the ship.  We had a wonderful experience and several members went above abd beyond to ensure we had an enjoyable experience.
5.0	Sail Date: Jul 16, 2017 /	"We just returned from the Oasis which departed on 7/16/17 and what a grand time we had. The level of service we received was outstanding. Every crew member we met or saw in passing greeted us with a smile and a great attitude. 

We stayed in a Jr. Suite on deck 12 and found it to be clean, neat and in good condition. Our cabin attendant was a hard worker and provided everything we needed. Thank you Vincent for everything you do. 

We ate in the main dining room with my time dining. Often we waited only a few minutes before we were seated. The dining room staff were the best, our waiters and assistant waiters were fantastic.  Tyari, Janet, Dheeraj and others were attentive to our every need without fail. 

We had a wonder vacation/anniversary trip. The ship is large with a lot of guest but it did not feel crowded. The elevators can get busy at times but so what you are on vacation. We also attended all the showed and found them to be entertaining. I think there were 6 different show in total. 

This was our second trip on RCCL the first was on Allure of the seas. My interaction with the crew and staff found the common goal is to make sure you have a great vacation and they accomplished that without fail. Keep up the good work."
5.0	Sail Date: Jul 16, 2017 /	Just got back Today from our cruise that started July 16th. Absolutely magnificent ship. Everything was top notch. This was out second cruise ever and our second with Royal Caribbean and because of the great first impression we had in 2015 we had high expectations. Well, RC did not disappoint. We tried their ZOOM internet with streaming this time around and it was perfect. Worked great for the whole cruise. My wife was able to sit out on our balcony and log into her school and do homework. If any new cruisers have questions I'd be more than happy to answer them. We'll be cruising again with RC in a year or two.
4.2	Sail Date: Jul 09, 2017 /	It was great.
4.8	Sail Date: Jul 09, 2017 /	Best cruise ever. Oasis is truly a wonderful experience. The restaurants are great, and the activities are endless.  Going to Europe next July 5, 2018 on Symphony of the Seas
5.0	Sail Date: Jul 09, 2017 /	Very fun. A lot to do for everyone. Guest services lines were usually very long. Wish they had phone support. Great staff, especially the restaurants. My Mom was legally blind and we did not know about the luggage valet service. By the time I asked it was closed. She is 85 and has difficulty walking. There should be more proactive services to identify passengers in need and recommend these services. I had to change my departure plans in order to assist her with her luggage. The porter for the airport shuttle moved her in front of the line but there was no one to help at the airport. No curbside Checking because the bus parked on the bottom floor by baggage claim. No one was there to carry or transport bags.
4.4	Sail Date: Jul 09, 2017 /	Great fun, good service through out the cruise, lots of great fun activities. Will return again with our grand kids next time. The onboard activities were plentiful and exciting. The staff was really attentive through out our cruise including helping us with our excursions and shopping
4.7	Sail Date: Jul 09, 2017 /	"Overall we had a wonderful time and can highly recommend Royal Carribean. 
Next time I will pick a cruise with more time in port and less time at sea."
5.0	Sail Date: Jul 02, 2017 /	Will be sailing on the Freedom of the Seas in April, out of San Juan. Anyone have any suggestions for lodging the night before cruise, in San Juan? Have checked Hotels.com, and just not sure what and where to choose.
5.0	Sail Date: Jul 02, 2017 /	This was my very first cruise and i loved it so much i would go back! Best type of vacation and amazing cruise line! Nothing disappointed me! The staff was great and the experience was out of this world!
4.6	Sail Date: Jul 02, 2017 /	Oasis class ships are amazing, you will not be disappointed.  RCL far exceeded our expectations, service and food was exceptional.  The ship had roughly 6400 passengers and we never felt crowded in anyway, I was very surprised by this.  I felt that the cruise was a very good value for the money and we will be cruising again very soon.
4.8	Sail Date: Jul 02, 2017 /	Overall great experience, you get what you pay for. Many complimentary options made it so I didn't have to spend a lot of money. All staff was very friendly and accommodating. Also, cruise director was very entertaining.
4.8	Sail Date: Jul 02, 2017 /	We loves every minute of the cruise -- so much so, we booked our next cruise while on board! We were a family of 11 from ages 10 to 84 and a good time was had by ALL!!
4.8	Sail Date: Jul 02, 2017 /	Amazing cruise, well done. Next year we will be traveling to the Caribbean again with Oasis of the seas. This time will be with our kids. Love it nice
5.0	Sail Date: Jul 02, 2017 /	Love this ship. definitely we coming back next year with the fam. awesome experience, food is great and the crew members totally professional. love it.
5.0	Sail Date: Jun 25, 2017 /	Huge ship with tons of things to do. Would recommend a balcony on the boardwalk side so you can see the Aqua show from your room. As well a great view of the ocean.
5.0	Sail Date: Jun 25, 2017 /	We reserved the Flow Rider for an hour the first sea day evening. It was terrific beyond words with great attention to the kids ages 12-15 and their parents. Very fun with individual instruction which the kids put to use for the rest of the trip during open riding.
5.0	Sail Date: Jun 25, 2017 /	Overall this was a fabulous experience. We enjoyed every day of our cruise. The excursions, which we scheduled though the cruise line, were for the most part very organized and ran smoothly. Getting off and back on the ship was very easy. The staff is very friendly, professional and helpful. Be sure to plan ahead. We scheduled all of our excursions months in advance, as well as some dinners and all shows and entertainment. We never had to wait in line for a meal or show. Getting on the ship on sailing day was quick even though there was a very long line of people, we only waited maybe a half hour all together. The ship is immaculate, there were people cleaning all the time.  The only hitch we had was that we bought a small bottle of rum in Labadee which was turned in as we returned to the ship, but never made it to our stateroom on the last day as promised. When we discovered it missing upon arriving home we contacted customer services who told us that even if they could find it they couldn't ship it to us. This was very disappointing.
5.0	Sail Date: Jun 25, 2017 /	Even though the ship was filled with people, it never seem crowded. All of the staff was kind and there was so many things to do on board. I definitely suggest getting a drink package it'll save you a lot of money.
5.0	Sail Date: Jun 25, 2017 /	This cruise was probably one of my top 3 vacations! The ship is beautiful. The food was plentiful and good. My husband and I were shocked that we preferred the Windjammer, Johnny Rockets, and smaller food venues around the ship over the Main Dining Room. The staff in the MDR could not have been more awesome but the food, in my opinion, was just OK. The cabin was clean and the steward was so nice and helpful. We never had an empty ice bucket and I asked for extra washcloths once and had them every day after. There were plenty of activities. I suggest just trying something new and different each day. I did line dancing by the pool, various trivia contests, and even the zip line. Our snorkeling excursion in Labadee was fun. I recommend getting lounge chairs in Columbus Cove. White sand and very relaxing. We did not care for our day at Falmouth (took a guided tour) but heard great things about Dunns River Falls. We will do that next time. In Cozumel we did Salsa, Salsa and Margaritas. Big fun. The margaritas were endless. You create and eat your own salsas, including a dessert salsa! Oh and for the first time in a long time the Casino was our friend!! We loved this cruise so much we are booked again in 2018!
4.7	Sail Date: Jun 25, 2017 /	Would love to go again. Great cruise, lots of memories. Ports and excursions were enjoyable. Loved the shows, the staff and the ship is beautiful. A few things could be improved, but overall a fabulous cruise!
4.7	Sail Date: Jun 25, 2017 /	The ships was amazing.  My husband and I needed a 2 bedroom grand suite with 3 teenagers in our room.  I wish there were suites with rooms across the hall for kids.
3.0	Sail Date: Jun 18, 2017 /	This boat is almost too big. Sooo many people and there were lines for everything. They need to work on crowd control for this ship. I also felt like the food wasn’t up to par with the other RC cruise ships. This ship requires guests to reserve shows ahead of time, which is ok but when you show up 45 minutes before showtime and have nowhere to sit because people are reserving whole rows of seats for the show is incredibly frustrating. They need to do something about that. We had a Central Park balcony room, which was great. All of the staff were super friendly. Overall, the experience was just okay, due to the insane crowds. We felt like we couldn’t participate in any activity or watch a show we reserved because of the amount of people.
4.5	Sail Date: Jun 18, 2017 /	Went with a group of 10.   Picked this ship for the amount of stuff to do onboard.   The ports don’t really change up on this ship.   Events can become crowded with so many people on board.  Ports of call will also be crowded with so many people.  Overall very enjoyable
4.0	Sail Date: Jun 18, 2017 /	So much to do on board.  Wish the oasis went to different ports.   Make sure to book entertainment in advance.  Comedy shows will fill up fast.
5.0	Sail Date: Jun 18, 2017 /	"The beauty and elegance of this ship.  The food excellent, pool areas beautiful, and the entertainment perfect.  My only negative about the ship was having to shut down the individual bars and lounges for all the entertainment on the Promenade deck. We were forced to listen to all that noise on the Promenade deck, and NOT the individual

places that had musical performances going on.  Otherwise, perfect!!!!"
5.0	Sail Date: Jun 18, 2017 /	Have cruised over 25 times.  This embarkation, disembarkation, dining experience, access to shows and activities tops them all.  Excursions were enjoy by all ages. Crew is unparalleled as to efficiency and human relation skills.  We travelled with our 18 children, in-laws and grandchildren.  Not a single negative comment from anyone.  Celebrated our 55th anniversary and many June birthdays.  We were worried about size of passenger load but were  very pleasantly surprised how effectively it is managed.  Kudos Oasis...you are amazing!😍👍
4.0	Sail Date: Jun 11, 2017 /	Cruised with Oasis of the Seas this week.  We disembarked this morning.  The ship was amazing.  It was huge!  It had a lot of activities to do.  We were never bored.  My only complaint was there were not a lot of options for vegetarians/gluten free people in the dining room.  Yes they had maybe 1 entree option for vegetarians and a couple of options for gluten free but not the combo of the 2 which I needed.  It was very very challenging.  But I have to say our server Mario went out if his way to accommodate me even though I ate the same thing every night.  Still very tasty food!
5.0	Sail Date: Jun 04, 2017 /	Ship was gorgeous and clean lots of activities pool deck was packed I loved the adult only solarium but I think the age needs to be raised from 16 to 21. Food was blah except the French onion soup and the crème brûlée yummy !!! I hated walking threw the smoking area. Lots of damage to that area. Burns in the chairs and tables. I am glad I quit 20 years ago. Anyway got on the ship fast our room attendant was so awesome. How ever we booked last minute and had to get a interior with 3 people never again on that. Our cruise director was every where and a blast. Every pina coloda that I got tasted different tasted nothing like one. Or the Long Island ice tea👎👎
5.0	Sail Date: Jun 04, 2017 /	This ship is huge. I I walked around the jogging track one time and my legs hurt (lol). The ship is pretty and clean. I had an interior this time and it wasn’t as bad as I thought. It was small but everything worked. I never used room service so I can’t say on that part. The pool deck was normal. (Crowded at times). The solarium was pretty. The dinning room food was good.(about a four). Loved the French onion soup. And they had these huge cakes at night with ice cream. That cake was to dye for. Went to chops grill(the service was okay the staff friendly and the food was very good). The aqua show was good about a 4 out of 5. The ice show was a 5+out of 5. I had a great time.
5.0	Sail Date: Jun 04, 2017 /	We travelled from Australia to the USA for this cruise, and for anyone who has traveled to/from Australia, then you'll know how gruelling the flight can be, but with this to look forward to, made it a whole more pallitable! We have cruised with Royal Caribbean once and they do have a certain edge to the whole experience. We had a balcony Oceanview room which has it advantages,  but I really wouldn't miss it as all the fun and entertainment happens everywhere else on the ship. You can do as much or as little as you like, but most of all you are guaranteed a great time. We would recommend this to anyone considering cruising. Some people have difficulty with being on the ocean,  but honestly, when I  did notice the ship listing somewhat side to side, I couldn't really feel it, only see it when looking to the horizon. The Oasis of the Seas is certainly a bug ship, with A LOT of passengers, but you don't feel crowded at all.
1.0	Sail Date: Jun 04, 2017 /	"Found many false charges to my room due to bartenders running cards for incorrect orders ~$150 worth.When they were questioned why the charges were there;  their explanation was that it was refunded so it did not matter

We received a group discount @ $92 per room but they only honored $52.15. When confronted with the paperwork they blamed their employee and implied that was enough justification not to settle the rest.

The house keeping was amazing made sure our room was clean and worked around our schedule.

We had an early flight the day we got back into port, so we tried to take care of our bills the day before but they managed to screw it up. At 630 in the morning, I had deal with them again because they failed to do their job correctly the night before.

Had to argue with an employee about where I wanted to sit on the beach in Labadee. The employee argued that I had to sit in the direct sun with my 2 yr old  because he worked there. Went off without him after yelling at him to get away from my family and found a spot under a tree.

I have many other complaints about this cruise line but won't drag on. Don't waste your money with Royal Caribbean."
5.0	Sail Date: Jun 04, 2017 /	"I just want to give a shoutout to the employees on Oasis of the Seas. You guys work hard all day everyday. I had an amazing vacation! Oasis of the Seas is a busy ship. If you get bored, you must be a boring person. This ship has so much entertainment. I wasted no time, I took advantage of the ship. Free: zip line, flow rider, basketball, ping pong, rock climbing, ice skating, gym, etc... Food is free except for specialty dinning. I ate dinner at 150 central, located in central park. I love it! Worth the money. I love this ship so much I just booked again for next year! 

Btw...I love dressing up for formal nights. 

Dress to impress!!"
4.0	Sail Date: Jun 04, 2017 /	We had an awesome time on Oasis. The staff was super-friendly and the ship has tons of things to do and see. Highly recommend this cruise for families or if you're ok with large crowds. If you aren't comfortable with large groups, this isn't the ship for you. I have been on many cruises and have always been able to participate in anything that was going on - with or without reservations. You HAVE to make reservations on this ship or you will find yourself meandering around while everyone else enjoys the shows! I feel like the larger ships, like Oasis and Allure, have too many staterooms which somewhat overwhelms the shows, casino, windjammer, flow riders, pool chairs, etc. We will definitely use Royal Caribbean again but will likely choose a ship with less people. Also, book your excursions through the cruise line. You can find the same excursions through other websites for a slightly less price but by the time you pay for a taxi (and deal with headaches associated with communicating with the locals) it is better to just stick with the cruise line and their transport to the excursion location. Buy the drink package. It reduces the stress of worrying about the drink prices while onboard. Have fun!!
2.0	Sail Date: Jun 04, 2017 /	"First time cruisers here. Not sure why people love cruises, so we thought we'd give it a try. Reasons why we will never do this again: 1) Crowds...large ignorant crowds with children running wild everywhere. Packed elevators all day and night. 2) Money hunger...Prying money from you at every turn. Tip, tip, tip...even if you pre-paid gratuities. Sell..sell..sell..pictures..pictures...pictures... Hundreds of dollars for a picture that cost about 30 cents to take and print. Pushy sales people at every turn in every port on every excursion. 3) large crowd at bars and broken drink machines all cruise long. 

 

We go on vacation to have fun and relax, not to fight crowds and get hassled by sales people on and off the ship."
4.0	Sail Date: May 28, 2017 /	Love Freedom, but due to repositioning we now have Oasis as our close to home ship, love them all. We like to be able to have a short drive both to and from or cruise if at all possible,  Lucky to be in Florida.
2.0	Sail Date: May 28, 2017 /	"Favorite part- Probably the fact that there was lots to do on board. Adventure Ocean for the under 12 crowds. Also St Marteen (and to a lesser degree St. Thomas) were nice ports.

 

St Marteen was great because there were things to do, but no pressure to buy things like at the other ports.  There is a nice beach right next to where the water taxi drops you off (I think it was $5 per person), so if you don't want to do a big excursion, then I would take the water taxi over to town, then just get off and you are at the beach.  Have a nice beach day. Also some pretty nice little places to eat lunch.

St Thomas- High pressure salespeople as soon as you get off the boat.  I would recommend getting away from the crowds as quick as possible. We went scuba diving at the St. Thomas Diving Club (if you are taking a taxi- about $11pp-, ask them to take you to Izzies), which was very cool. 

Bahamas- the stop really wasn't long enough to experience it..We had to be back on the boat by 2:30, so it wasn't worth it to go to Atlantis (at least for us) which was the main thing we wanted to do.

 

On board, there were plenty of things to do.  However, almost everything is CROWDED.  The pool decks filled up extremely fast, so I would either go early or go late (after 3:00).  The Flowriders, zip line, and rock walls all had extended wait times, even though there were 2 flowriders and 2 rock walls. They are also only open very specific times of the day. That was annoying.  Ping pong tables were actually one of the best things on the boat- there was usually a table available, and they had arranged it so that any wind was minimized.

 

Food- much poorer than our first RC cruise. I know they have to cook for more people, but last year we went on Freedom of the Seas (which was also a big boat), and were able to rave about the food.  I am scared to recommend RC right now because of the food we had.  I don't know if they were really trying to drive people to the ""pay"" restaurants, but it almost worked with us.  Granted, I know Windjammer is a buffet style restaurant, but some of the stuff looked and seemed like it had been recycled from the past 3 or 4 days.  On the Freedom, it felt new everyday, with plenty of variety.  In the main dining room, the service was good, but the food very average.  Probably not as good as a majority of your average chain restaurants.  I did try the lobster the night they offered it for free- even got 2 of them, but it was overcooked and tough.  Probably wouldn't get it again.

Some of the other free options were much better.  The Park Cafe and the Wipeout Cafe actually put out decent food for what it was.  Not sure about the others. 

If you have youngsters- we had 11yo and 7yo-, the Adventure Ocean has plenty of activities.  Also, they have the late night party for the kids if the adults want to do something later at night.  And there are some pretty good late night (10 PM +) things to do. 

 

The other major gripe.  The shows are not built around the various main dining room meal times.  If you are going to do the shows, which I recommend, especially the ""Come Fly with Me"".  I would make show reservations as soon as possible(they do enforce the early entries with those that have reservations), then figure out your meal plans after that. On the Freedom of the Seas, all the showtimes allowed us to eat at our main dining room time.  We had chosen the 8PM meal time both cruises, so that we would never feel rushed on the days of excursions, or coming back from the sports deck/pool..  I thought it worked out great on the first cruise on the Freedom of the Seas, but it screwed up the showtimes on the Oasis.  Unless you want your kids up until midnight each night.  (Makes for a tough morning for them though, which makes it tougher for me, yada, yada, yada).

 

If you are going to go on Oasis, I would definitely recommend getting a balcony room, even for the extra money.  The interiors are just not made for more than 2 people. Do try to get deck 5 or 8.  The boat is huge, and these decks allow you to go between the front of the boat and the back of the boat very easily (via Central Park-8th floor- or the Main Concourse-5th floor).  I would also try to get towards the back of the boat if possible.

 

For the opportunity to have an extra flowrider, extra rock wall, zip line, and the water show, it wasn't worth the poor foods and the crowds.  Next we will go on a slightly smaller boat that still has most of the amenities."
4.0	Sail Date: May 28, 2017 /	"As usual, RCCL shows were top notch.  The Oasis sparkled, and the crew was warm and friendly.  However, as I feared, leaving on May 28th resulted in an over abundance of children.  A total of 1700 to be exact.  Many of them unattended.  Some of this was in the pool areas, and even in the casino.  As a parent of 2 grown children, I always enjoyed family vacations. But, never did I let my children run unatteded.  I observed a child maybe 4 years old with water wings on, going from the whirlpool/hot tub to the pool, back & forth, while her mother was sun bathing.  Many of the whirlpools/ hot tubs were filled with all ages of children, a deterrent for me, to be sure.  I normally do not cruise when school is out, but, due to   scheduling issues choose this week.  I realize it's all about the money, and RCCL is trying to get their share of the ""family"" market, since they've aligned themselves with Pixair.  I will probably cruise again on RCCL, but, will double check children's vacations prior.  I currently have a September 11 day cruise booked with Celebrity:)"
5.0	Sail Date: May 28, 2017 /	I enjoyed everything about the cruise. My family and I had so much fun, everyone was so wonderful and Oasis of the Seas was amazing. There is so much to do and so many different events always going on. The cruise director was the best cruise director I have ever been on a cruise with. We had all the best staff and I can not think of one negative thing about the cruise!!
5.0	Sail Date: May 21, 2017 /	SECRET!!!  If you don’t mind the walk a front obstructive view is the way to go. NO obstruction and much larger room. Get one in the middle. Most travel agents don’t even know about these. Look at pix of ship. Have them look at these for you we moved our furniture forward for more room
4.0	Sail Date: May 21, 2017 /	"We have never been on such a big ship.  The good thing was there were plenty of places to sit, the bad thing was it was confusing to know where to go and what to do.  The food was very good. We got dinner for two a specialty restaurant I would say don't waste your money the included meals and dinning rooms are GREAT!  I was very surprised that we were not offered a wine menu in any of the venues. People on the ship were very nice.  A word of caution don't forget anything in your cabin because you won't get it back, they call you back and say they couldn't find it.  On other ships I got stuff back very nicely. 

There were not very many activies and the movies are outside, if I went on this ship again I would book a balcony over the boardwalk so I could sit there and watch the movies and things."
5.0	Sail Date: May 21, 2017 /	"The Oasis was MASSIVE, nearly 1/4 of a mile long!  Our cruise was fully booked with 6,000 guests and not once did we feel ""crowded"" or overwhelmed with people. There is so much to do and see you have NO EXCUSE if you are ""bored"" at sea. The balcony stateroom we had was noticeably smaller than the one we had on the Freedom of the Seas, but it was still sufficient and not claustrophobic.   Best cruise yet!"
5.0	Sail Date: May 21, 2017 /	Beautiful ship I will take another cruise on the ship again. Great food, great service and room service. We went to three islands, the best was Labadee, we had a cabana, great service and a wonderful lunch 👌

Loved the crew and ship. Will definitely book again. 👍🏼😊🛳⚓️"
5.0	Sail Date: May 14, 2017 /	Love this ship! All positive review, I don’t look for anything negative while on vacation period! Will book again! We never felt like it was too crowded, everyone is spread out on this big ship.
4.8	Sail Date: May 14, 2017 /	It’s hard to believe that the oasis of the seas was the first one, mega ships that is. I’ve been on three of them now, including the Harmony and the Allure.  And these mage ships have so much in common. If you like one, you’ll like them all. Another thing, with these large ships, if you’re prone to seasickness, these big ships can battle out some pretty big waves before you even feel them. They have so many shops and eateries and things to do, I’ve been in some ports that had fewer things to do than what this ship has to offer. I’ve met some travelers that never even get off the ship because of all the offering and going on.  Me personally? When I look for my future cruises, I’m not looking for the Destiination, I am looking at what I’m going to be traveling on. I see more ships in my future.
5.0	Sail Date: May 14, 2017 /	"The Oasis of the Seas is the first of 4 mega cruise ships. Although I went on the Allure of the Seas as my first time Mage ship cruiser. The Oasis is identical. I like to explore posts, YouTube’s and documentaries about these ships before actually getting on them to familiarize myself. It does help because I already knew a lot about the ship before I got on board. Like the fact, it’s so big it identifies itself as having 7 neighborhoods. Central Park is my favorite. A romantic pathway shrouded by vegetation, with several of the fine dining restaurants (Chops Grill, 150 Central Park , Giovanni’s Table,) and a little secret that is not advertised is in the wine tasting room “Vintages” the have on display under a large glass table, one of the world largest bottles of wine. Not to mention, you can jump on the rising tide bar that literally moves up and down 2 decks from Central Park to the promenade below. 
I’ve mentioned I my other posts, my wife and I love to go dancing. No, we’re not professional, just can’t stand still. The Oasis of the Seas has an awesome dance floor with the good old fashioned under floor lighting that brings back that Saturday night fever throwback feel. This can be found in Dazzles. Live bands that play the best songs to dance with. DJs rocking the sounds with the younger crowds, and live Jazz sounds to mellow out with a nice drink in your hand. 
Speaking of relaxing, there are a lot of pools to soak up and splash around. There even a bigs swimming area for the little ones. But if your not into that shrill and splashing, there is an adult pool area in the solarium. They do a good job keeping the kids out of there. 
For activities, they have an Ice skating rink, 2 Rock climbing walls, a zip line, a merry-go-round, 2 Flow riders, Mini golf, Basketball court, arcade (and over 400 game casino) And more! 
I haven’t even mention the shows, or specialty restaurants, or spas and huge fitness center with all the state of the are equipment and an enormous jogging track, and lounges.. so much to do that it just demands a second trip."
5.0	Sail Date: May 14, 2017 /	"Just got off the Oasis on Sunday. What a beautiful ship! Embarkation was effortless. We we're on the ship by 11:30 am. We ate at the Park Cafe. The roast beef sandwiches were good but not great. 
  Our cabin was ready along with our luggage by 13:00 which was nice! We unpacked everything. Do not bring extra storage if there are only two of you! There's plenty of storage everywhere in the ocean view balcony cabins! There's plenty of hangers as well. The bed was almost too comfy. The couch was by the closet. We moved the coffee table to the side of the couch and had a pretty big area to move around the room in. Nice! 
   The staff was excellent everywhere we went. They called you by name. Our wait staff was awesome. Rowella and Ralph made our meals fun. 
I do have to say one thing about a particular bartender. I had been on my 3rd drink. Don't judge me. Lol  
  When I ordered the same drink, I watched him make it and he only put one shot of rum in my Miami Vice drink! Which has three different rum shots in it. 😒 I just let him know and he quickly corrected the situation. 
Solarium was awesome. It was our hangout spot for most of the cruise. I didn't really care for the free breakfast in the Solarium. 
  We stuck to the American Icon for breakfast and our main dining room for dinner. The food was great. We didn't feel like we missed anything by sticking to the main dining room and not eating at the specialty restaurants for dinner. We ate salsa, guacamole and chips from Sabor when we watched the movies in the Aqua Theater. Fun! 
   The excursions we took was very educational.     On Haiti we took the historical tour and paradise cove  beach break. Nice beach with very calm waters. Only the people on the tour was there. Maybe 20 people? It was very quiet compared to the crowded Labadee beach. 😳
We snorkeled there and saw great fish 🐟 we also saw a stingray wondering around! We loved this excursion. Originally, we were suppose to take the Amiga Island tour and meet up with the Ecological Researchers. They were suppose to show us around the new nursery of Reefs but somehow we were put on this tour. 😳
  It was fine with us because this tour seemed much more informative for us. 
  In Jamaica we did the Go Native Tour.  Now this was a great city tour. It was also very interesting learning about the real side of Jamaica, their culture and how they really live. We went to an elementary school and talked to the children there, ages 3-7? See my pics! It was a great opportunity to meet and hear these children sing to us. 
   In Cozumel we did the Tulum and Beach Break. This was another win for us! The Ruins were equal to or better than the Xunatunich Ruins we saw in Belize. I have nothing negative to say about this Mayan site. The beach break was good. The food was excellent. The beach was very clean but had a good amount of seaweed which is not the resorts fault. The surf was a little too much for my liking but all in all it was a nice beach with plenty of shade. 
  I love this ship. It was beautiful. From Central Park to the Boardwalk and all of its attractions and rides, everything was beautifully made. I can't wait to book Symphony of the Seas."
4.0	Sail Date: May 14, 2017 /	Just got off our cruise on the Oasis. Outstanding service in the American Icon restaurant. However the quality of food and service in Johnny Rockets for lunch was sub par and for breakfast was poor. I guess I expected more from a well known restaurant/venue. Windjammer selection and overall experience was great. Our room was on deck 11. Room steward was stellar. Mattress was hard but he brought us extra pillows and a topper for the mattress. The ship was spotless. Entertainment was great . We booked everything in advance. Even getting off the ship was quick and easy. Off and at our car in 20 min. I will be cruising with Royal again.
5.0	Sail Date: May 14, 2017 /	The ship is fantastic and the service is superior. Our favorite part of the cruise was the days just sailing and enjoying the many events during the day.
5.0	Sail Date: May 14, 2017 /	"Oasis is a big city and we have a lot of fun  !!!!!   

The enterteniment on board never stop. 

I wanna came back soon.  @@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@"
5.0	Sail Date: May 14, 2017 /	This ship was immaculate, the crew was perfect, the food was heavenly, and the events (shows, etc.) were awesome! Everything was planned perfectly from the moment we stepped onto the ship until we arrived back at the port!
4.0	Sail Date: May 14, 2017 /	"I was on the oasis for the May 14th-21st sailing in a Junior Balcony suite on the 6th floor. Majority of the week was overcast but we made the best of it. This was my 6th cruise and first one royal, I've been on Norwegian and carnival. 

I give 4 stars due to how pushy the staff were on upselling. We were literally sitting down lounging and workers came up to us asking if we wanted to book a specialty night at Izumi bc I guess not many people were reserving. This happened to us twice. They're also really pushy on beverage packages, wifi and booking your next cruise! We felt like we continually had to say ""that's not included"" or ""oh that's extra"" when on vacation it's nice if everything is included! We got the deluxe beverage package bc of this but still felt nickeled and dimed in other ways. Anyway...... 

Firstly, the cabin was awesome. There were 4 of us and we never felt cramped. We had a walk in closet and plenty of space including a balcony on the hump which was really nice. We were worried about being on the 6th floor due to being so close to the promenade and boardwalk (noise) but i think we got really lucky, the room was quit and in a perfect spot close to everything!

The ship is HUGE. But I think you knew that. It's exhausting to walk!! But it's beautiful, all the features and activities you come across. Never had an issue finding a lounge chair on the deck. Never waited for mini golf or ping pong, never longer than a 10-15 wait for the zip line or surf simulator. We saw cats but left 30 minutes into it, it didn't really grab our attention. The aqua show was cool! And the comedians were good. We made reservations for all shows but never went to the reservations lol. We just went when we wanted and never had an issue getting a good seat. They'd let us in. 

The food was the best part. The food was amazing and we never had any complaints. We never had issues finding a table at the windjammer which a lot of people on here complain about. You just gotta look a little. The food in the windjammer was always fresh and always had variety especially for lunch and dinner. 

We had access to coastal kitchen for dinner. We went on the very last night - the food was OK here. But we only went one night so can't speak for the rest of the cruise. Food and service in main dining room was also excellent, and you get priority seating if you're in a suite which was nice. 

We ate at 150 Central Park on the first night, food was pretty good if you're into fancy bone marrow and 10 different types of salt to spread on your bread, lol. It was pretty good.

Haiti was beautiful, but when you get in the water I'd recommend water shoes bc there's a ton of rocks in the water. They provide lunch on the beach which is nice and there's plenty of bars.

Falmouth - DO AN EXCURSION!!! We didn't have one booked and we wish we did!!! 

Cozumel, beautiful as always. We went to nachi cocom which I highly recommend. They only allow like 150 ppl there per day (there were probably 30 all day while we were there) plus it's open bar and clean! 

All and all I great week! Oh and I'd recommend the beverage package but buy it online before you leave, we got it for $46/day and when we got on the ship it was $64/day."
5.0	Sail Date: May 07, 2017 /	We thoroughly enjoyed our cruise on the Oasis of the Seas - so much so that we booked another within a year. We loved our junior balcony room and were quite impressed with the space. Highly recommend!!!
5.0	Sail Date: May 07, 2017 /	Ship was amazing and I️ did not feel like there was 6000 people on there except for one stop on the Bahamas because we had a shore excursion with a conference group of about 2400 people.  Rooms were large
5.0	Sail Date: May 07, 2017 /	not a review but a question.  I have seen where people take bottle water on board with them.  do you check it, put it in luggage?  I don't want to carry it all morning waiting to get to my room.
5.0	Sail Date: May 07, 2017 /	"We had the greatest cruise we could ever imagine.  

Our outstanding cabin steward was Courtney on Deck 3, who was so willing to help us.  We couldn't have anyone better to take care of us.

In dining, we ate at the American Icon ( Deck 3) where we had ""My Time Dining Seating"", which helped us to be able to eat in time to get to our evening activities.  We sat each night at Table 112 where Edison and Edd were extremely attentive to us and remembered our preferences each and every night.  We returned to this table after the first evening due to the exceptional service they provided.  We reserved this table each evening before leaving the dining room.  

We can't say enough about these 3 people.  We felt like they were family and were so sad to have to say goodbye.

The shows and activities were varied and so numerous that we were constantly on the go.  We again were very pleased with our opportunities.  To think that we saw a Broadway play, an Aquatic  Show, a comic and super entertaining juggling act, a Headliner show that was right out of Cirque de Sole, and even a super ice skating event.

Other evening entertainments included, a terrific violinist & keyboard player in Central Park, Jazz, a Comedy act, a great guitarist and singer, named Cat, plus many more."
5.0	Sail Date: May 07, 2017 /	Great time good food every crew member was great to help or offer help. Fine dining was great our head server and his assistant was very polite and worked very very hard and fast to please everybody at our table.
1.0	Sail Date: May 07, 2017 /	I expected high quality service and food.  We got neither. For the price we paid we were extremely disappointed. Although the ship was beautiful, the service was poor.  Our room steward didn't make an effort to get to know us which was disappointing. The food on board was bland and old and I wouldn't feed it to my dog. We spent money in the specialty restaurants and got fantastic food in two of the three.  Pretty sad when you have to spend extra money to get a decent meal. I will never cruise with Royal Caribbean again--does not hold a candle to Norwegian who had top notch service and excellent food.
4.0	Sail Date: May 07, 2017 /	Great cruise for our family 5. we were in a interior family room that sleep 6 and felt it was very roomy. shows were great,food was over the top. Kids clubs is a must do. my daughter who's 7 wanted to spend all day there. we did have her spend dinner there on two different nights that we were eating in restaurants that I knew she wouldn't care for. they would take all the kids that were still in there at 5 o'clock up to the Windjammer and they thought it was the greatest thing. the parade was awesome just make sure you show up early it does get very crowded. only downside was the other passengers that thought it was okay to save  a whole row of seats for shows for their families members that were showing up later and it was about to start . just felt like crew member should have stepped in and did more. same at the pool the ones that put their towels out at 7 and don't come back until after 9 but on second day at sea pool staff was out timing how long people are gone.  the staff was great!!
4.0	Sail Date: May 07, 2017 /	"This was a great cruise for us and our family- however; there are certain things that they do not tell you when booking a vacation such as this. First off the fact that we had to purchase a beverage package on board before we where even able to get a soda anything other than water, lemonade, or UNSWEETENED tea. 
The soda machines are a joke! They only worked 50% of the week and of the times that they where working the drinks where flat and had no flavor. HOWEVER all that being said this overall was a great experience and the waiter staff in the main hall was fantastic. Room service was excellent. Shore excursions where excellent. 😊"
5.0	Sail Date: May 07, 2017 /	"Just got off the ship around 8am. Soooo much to see and do on this ship. Unfortuantely it rained when at St. Thomas and St. Maarten, but that is not RC's fault. Luckily, there is much to do on the ship to keep you entertained. if I have any tips for anyones 1st time on this boat, it is as follows:

1) The 1st day will probably be the only day you will tell that there is 6k people on board, especially during the 1st main dining dinner times. Almost everyone is trying to find out where there table is and the line was super long.

*Helpful hint for this: Your seapass will have the deck number, dining time and table number on it. That should cut some time off on the wait. 

2) If you haven't booked an excursion and don't mind getting a taxi, the prices range from $3/pp to $10/pp. At St. Maarten, we paid $6pp round trip and was given a wristband showing we paid for round trip. (downside to that was that a taxi was not always readily available and was difficult trying to find one that used the wristbands. Taxi services are busy, which I already anticipated, so it did not bother me, but this is for those who do not want to wait.)

3) The ""one time only"" sales on board usually happen again on the last at sea day, but you may not find what you liked by then because it will be gone on the 1st day of sale. 

4) The windjammer (buffet) for lunch was super packed and a wait was needed during the first 2 days. I would suggest looking at other places for lunch if you do not want to wait 30mins to eat. 

5) If you want to buy liquor, wait until you get off the ship at the ports. They costs less then what they sell them for on the ship. (ex. A bottle of Hennesey white on ship cost $58. Same bottle in St. Maarten, $39.99. You will get the liquor back on the last at sea day either way. 

6) I am a person who like my room around 63° when i sleep, but my room (#8100) seemed warm at nights. take a fan if need be. 

7) Smoking IS allowed on the ship, just in certain areas. 

8) Formal dinner night was on Day 2 and Day 6

I am sure I am missing a bunch of other things, but if you have any questions, please ask. I loved this ship and all of what I stated above is only my opinion. Everyone has different experiences, but again, I did not feel there was over 6k people on the ship. I hardly saw kids around. Great ship, great experience and would definitely go again!!"
5.0	Sail Date: May 07, 2017 /	I'm not planning to write a long review, I'll keep it short and sweet. We have absolutely no complaints. Everything from food to service to activities to entertainment was top notch. we even made a few friends along the way.
5.0	Sail Date: May 07, 2017 /	This ship is breath taking! It's the greatest I have ever seen! You literally cannot do everything in 7 days! We ate at chops, givonnis, sabor, johnny rockets and all are top notch! The crew is amazing and really try to help make it very special. Casino is great I won at table games several nights and hit jackpot on machine for $984.02! We attended the art auctions and enjoyed free champagne and bought a couple nice pieces!! The adult only solarium is great, we chose to stay on board during Nassau bc we have been several times, and enjoy the solarium and relax, we both took advantage of the spa services and for couples I recommend the mud and bath ritual, you won't regret it! For us this cruise was all about the ship and even though we stayed active and going we came no where close to doing everything, so we enjoyed ourselves so much we booked back to backs next May on same ship!!
4.0	Sail Date: Apr 30, 2017 /	We love the ship, over 6k people aboard &never felt overcrowded. Not thrilled with Royal Caribbean’s buffets. We have sailed on two ships and the omelet stations are poor quality. Other lunch and dinner foods lukewarm. We had a boardwalk balcony, great view of the Aqua Show. We would do the Oasis  Class ships again.
4.0	Sail Date: Apr 30, 2017 /	Does anyone know if i book my next cruise onboard RC and get onboard credit toward my next cruise and months lares I find more deals will I be able to take advantage of along with the benefits that I will receive for my next cruise because I booked will on board my current cruise?
5.0	Sail Date: Apr 30, 2017 /	My husband & I got back May 7th from Bahamas. The cruise was amazing & so was the staff. Our excursions were tons of fun too! We stopped in Nassau, St Thomas, & St Marteen.
3.0	Sail Date: Apr 30, 2017 /	"The food was mediocre at best. We ate at many of the complimentary restaurants, including room service, and the food mostly very poor quality. We attended 3 dinners/lunches that we paid extra for and honestly, while the food was better, it was overpriced. 

Overall the ship was pretty clean. We saw very few bugs on the decks. 

Double check pricing before shopping at duty/tax free stores onboard. Some items are still cheaper online. 

Drink package was worth it. Once you realize subpar food doesn't settle well you will opt to drink your calories. 

Internet was undependable, going in and out randomly. There was almost a full day where it stopped working for a large percentage of the boat but there was no urgency or concern from the support staff. 

Ice cream machines were broken or closed more often than not. 

The ship staff were very friendly, polite and courteous."
5.0	Sail Date: Apr 30, 2017 /	Just got off Oasis.  Absolutely stunning ship!  Wow does not do it justice.  We had a junior suite and our friends had an ocean balcony.  We checked in a different line because of the suite and were on board within 10 minutes.  Even though our friends went a different way, the line moved quickly and took less than 30 minutes.  We went to the park cafe which was one of our favorite places.  Our 8 year old granddaughter loved the kid's club.  Only 250 kids on board, 2 weeks ago they had over 2000.  We bought the unlimited digital photo package and got a disc with 210 photos.  Dining room food and service was very good.  Ate at windjammer one time which was ok.  Got omelettes at Wipeout cafe which was good.  Ate lunch in the dining room one day, very good.  They didn't enforce no shorts in the dining room which I wish they would.  The parade the last night was fun, shows were amazing.  My personal opinion is it's not too big and I would definitely sail her again.  We booked our next cruise while on board.  $100 deposit, $100 OBC for this cruise and $100 for the next.  The fitness center was great, got our hair done for the second formal night.  No problem with our sea pass account.  I did the rock climbing and Zipline.  Our friend did the flow riders and loved it.  Great cruise and good weather.
5.0	Sail Date: Apr 30, 2017 /	I was on April 30 sailing with adult daughter and daughter in laws. Besides the size of this amazing  ship, I found  the service and food to be top notch.  I only Sail RC and had noticed a decline in food quality and happiness of crew over last 2 cruises. Well Oasis does it right. Our cabin Stewart Rosendo and main dining servers Julio and Artem could not have been more helpful  and engaging.  If Royal could have all crew become the same caliber employees as these young men it would increase their satisfaction scores. Don't miss the dive show and come fly with me. Wish we could have seen dive show at night but due to winds had to sit in heat of day. So worth it.
5.0	Sail Date: Apr 30, 2017 /	"This was an amazing experience. The staff and the serviceberries friendly and knowledgeable. It took a few days to orient ourselves on this huge ship. We loved Central Park and spent a lot of time there--easiest location for lunch. If you didn't want buffet for breakfast, Johnny Rockets was a surprising option.  I was surprised how much turbulence we experienced with a ship this size. We had a mid-ship balcony room and felt significant motion every night. 

We will be on the sister ship next February and I can't wait."
4.0	Sail Date: Apr 30, 2017 /	It was a lovely ship. We took our children, their spouses and grandchildren on the Eastern Caribbean  route. We were disappointed  in activities for younger children. Ages 6-8. They weren't able to participate in all activities because of weight. They weren't impressed with kids camp. They did like the pools. We were all disappointed because there was a large group sailing with us.  There were 2600 with this group. We found that several times during the cruise that areas were closed to us as they had functions. Boardwalk was closed at night when we would have liked to stroll there and use the carousel   We have cruised many times before. The food and service were no better than other lower priced cruise lines.
5.0	Sail Date: Apr 23, 2017 /	"I'll organize this extensive review by the following categories:

 

Staterooms: they were very nice overall, the bathroom is tiny of course (flushing the toilet is a little tricky) but it's a nice place to hang out and watch TV for a little bit.  Depending on the location of your room, you may get unwanted noise from the Promenade or Pool Deck.  Central Park occasionally has live classical music.  I think deck 6 may be ideal since many places of interest are between decks 4 and 8.  The stateroom attendants were very nice and accommodating.

 

Restaurants: the buffet had a great variety of average food, but some items were above average.  The main dining hall is nice enough that you could skip the specialty restaurants and not be missing out on much.  They have a changing menu, which the specialty restaurants don't have.  150 Central was a little disappointing, Izumi Hibachi was fun but had average food, but Giovanni's was excellent! Sorrento's and Dog House are good for a quick tasty snack.  Park Cafe is better than the Promenade Cafe.  Wipeout Cafe is good for a quick build-your-own burger and fries.  Chops Grille was trying to round up more customers. 

 

Shows: Ice Skating show is pretty good.  Aquatheater wasn't bad.  We skipped Cats and the Adult Comedy Show.  Headliner Show was just OK.  Love & Marriage gameshow was hilarious as before.  Promenade can be really loud when they're doing a parade or something.  The trivia contests are not as fun as I thought they would be.

 

Activities: Rock climbing is harder than it looks.  Surfing didn't look too hard since the guides help you.  Mini Golf is fine, but wear some sun screen.  Zip Line is OK.  Ping Pong and Basketball are fine and not crowded.  The Gym is nice as well as the jogging/walking path. 

 

Ship Rocking: it was usually a subtle swaying when at sea (even with tall waves), so not a problem.  After the first day I got used to it and didn't notice the swaying anymore.  Very stable overall.

 

Other passengers: I would say the average passenger was a 55 yr old couple with no kids.  The majority of passengers were 50+, so younger people are the minority.  I did see some young families with small kids (which I think is a bad idea in general on a cruise) and single people were few and far between (not counting the crew). 

 

Pricing: on board WiFi was $90 per device for the week on my cruise, which I think is expensive.  Specialty restaurants are around $40 per person, which I don't think is worth it.  Johnny Rockets is $7 per person.  Scoops is around $2.50 to $4.50 per item.  Gift Shops are expensive, especially for sunscreen.  Shore Excursions are a fair price I think, but remember that they want a tip in the end too. 

 

Ports: Falmouth and Cozumel are tourist traps with many shops all selling the same things, which is boring.  So, do an excursion there.  Labadee is fun enough without excursions, I guess."
3.0	Sail Date: Apr 23, 2017 /	"Overall, we loved our vacation!
However, we will not be sailing on RCCL again. We found that this large ship had fewer family friendly activities than our crew actually needed or desired. Since we have sailed with Disney, I think we had a bit of a culture shock on Oasis.

Who Is On the Ship?
 Familes with kids were the minority. Scooters, canes, wheelchairs, the aged, severely obese and ill people  were the majority.  At one port, an ambulance and a stretcher was being brought on board.... wow. 
At lunch one day, my kids were the only ones in the room. Everyone else was grey haired. 

Poolside...
The pools catered to the kiddos early, but for really young kids, there was one tiny area for them to get wet. That was dissapointing for a ship this large. Older kids had it ok for the early hours of the day. 

Lunch and Dinner
The food was great, the desserts were awesome, the service was good. The windjammer is good,  but the Solarium is good too, they just keep kids out (16 and over). It's the same food. 
The specialty restaurant we went to....150 Central Park, was OK. I didn't pay for it, another travel agent perk, but I had better dishes in the dining hall. Dinners, overall, were yummy. I wouldn't pay for any specialty restaurant on board.

Other Stuff...
Central Park was lovely, but I found myself always desiring to see the ocean... after all, that is why I took a cruise!
The Mall was boring. RCCL puts on ""flash sales"" every 2 days...and the folks go nuts for a tshirt or a hat that they should have packed...
The plus was Starbucks. A gift card is the way to go, because there are no extra fees. You're welcome. 

Cleanliness and Care....
The poolside ""frozen yogurt"" machine was the most disgusting thing I have ever seen on a ship. It was unmonitored, and it was a melted mess. I asked an attendant about it, who stated it was not his job. Wow. We never touched it. Guests busted into closets for cones and left the machines running. 

Our room attendant was good, but I noticed signs of mold/ mildew in the shower, and a ring in the toilet..... so...I kept wondering, how clean was my stateroom? 
Lastly, a family with kids needs Laundry facilities.... we got wonderful fluff and fold,  but.... I need to do it myself, and not wait 2 days for it. 


 We had many wonderful perks, since we booked through a travel agent, and our excursions we marvelous.  

Shows..  
We didnt see any. The much anticipated water show, kept being canceled. All the other shows were too late for my kids. A total bust there. 


I hope this helps someone, I want to be honest in my review.... If you have a young family, book with Disney...but if you are much, much much older, and want diamonds tax free...Oasis is for you."

4.0	Sail Date: Apr 23, 2017 /	The ship and the accommodations was very nice and the service and staff for most part was AWESOME. . The Solarium pool was very hot and the pools for most part were packed and standing room only. The food in the main dinning room was good but everywhere else it was okay. Stay away from the Pizza on the main deck. Book your entertainment months before your cruise otherwise you won't get into any of the shows. We tried to book the comedy show 2 months in advance and could not book online. Even though we had reservations for the Oasis water show we almost did not get in because no one was checking the reservations. The Headliner and the Oasis water shows were the great but  Cats was too long of a show. I recommend the couples massage. That was also awesome.
5.0	Sail Date: Apr 16, 2017 /	One of my favorite ships! Lots to do and love the Atrium area. My son absolutely loves the kids program at night and never wants to leave until he’s the last one.
5.0	Sail Date: Apr 16, 2017 /	"Everything about the Oasis of the Seas and our cruise was wonderful! The ship was beautiful and there was so much to do. The staff was great and so engaging, they made sure everyone had fun. They offered an awesome kids program that our 12 year old enjoyed and looked forward to going to everyday. We choose the 3 day specialty dining package and all of the restaurants were good, but next time I will take advantage of eating in more of the restaurants that are considered ""complimentary"" as the food was pretty good in those areas too. There were some things that were not that great but most were. I recommend eating breakfast in the dining room, they had the best banana pancakes and a good buffet. The dining room is also a good option for lunch. If you don't feel like dressing up for dinner, the Windjammer had good dinner choices. You could get the same things the dining rooms were serving but in a more casual setting. On one of the formal nights they have lobster in the main dining rooms but it's also served in the Windjammer. You can eat breakfast at Johnny Rockets for free but lunch/dinner is $6.95 which is not bad. We did not purchase the drink package since we would not drink the amount it would cost for the package, however around the 3 day they offered a drink card that you could purchase for $79 for 10 drinks. This was more our speed so my husband and I each had 5 drinks on different days that was perfect. I would purchase this option the next time as well. Just wait a couple of days and it will be offered. The complimentary lemonade was great!!! One thing we did not like was the smell of the pizza at Sorento's. I know this may seem like nothing, but for some reason this smell made us feel sick. Because of the smell, I could not bring myself to eat it. My husband said it tasted ok but it was not true Italian pizza they advertise it to be. The shows we saw were great and we even got to see a recent movie in 3-D in the theater with our daughter. The Vroom internet service worked with no issues. I did not have to have this but my husband is addicted to his phone so it was a must for him. I used it to post pictures of our vacation and to text my husband on the ship if were apart looking for each other. There were a lot of families with walkie talkies on the ship which I guess is a good way to keep up with everyone. Overall our trip was great and we really had a good time, so much so that we booked our next cruise during this one. Looking forward to the next one!"
5.0	Sail Date: Apr 16, 2017 /	This was our second time in a row going on the Oasis for our anniversary. We were new to cruising  last year and discovered we love it! Would not go shorter than 7 days because it's too sad to leave. We have seen some negative reviews once in awhile, but I often wonder if they were on the same cruise we were! We love how many restaurants are free and specialty ones also. We paid to eat at Chops for lunch and one dinner. Filet mignon cooked to perfection for both of us both times. And If they didn't  we know they would have apologized profusely and delivered the right steak very quickly.  Great restaurant and ambiance there! We ate at Giovanni's Table one night when it was windy and rainy and it was candle light by the paned window looking out at Central Park. Our MTD staff seemed very busy and handling a lot of people but we never suffered. They were very personable. Wish they had less tables to wait on though. But we still had a blast. The Centerpiece band in Dazzles at night is NOT to be missed.  Frank Sinatra homage in Jazz the last night was the cherry on top. What I DID not like , was how we had to wait 45 minutes on hot concrete in the hot sun, (almost passed out...no water) for the air conditioned buses to bring us to Orient Beach Rendezvous. Loved the beach but the bathroom and shower was not very nice. Lunch on that trip was good and pleasant to sit under little open side huts .Very pretty!  Overall we enjoyed that excursion but it started out by baking us in the sun so being in my 60s it  was hard to fully enjoy the sun on the beach. I was over done! Our favorite excursion is one many don't go to.Secret Sands Beach Exclusive in St Thomas . A ride in an open sided safari type shuttle through poor neighborhoods finally brings you to this quiet beautiful cove that is part of a preserve I think so only a certain number can go at a time. Maybe 60 ? Not sure but we love it there. Quiet and non commercial. Your great host has a cooler of sodas, water and fruit rum punch for free courtesy of RC. He appreciates tips at the end. We had him two years in a row and we enjoy the whole thing very much. So much in the compass every night that we check it out, discuss and highlight what we will do the next day. This year my husband strolled down to the Schooners Bar and participated in trivia games a few times. I took more naps. I cannot understand anyone who would not appreciate all the Royal Caribbean offers on her grand lady Oasis of the Seas. We did the Eastern Caribbean. Next April we go on the sister ship Allure for the Western Caribbean. We switched to outside balcony this year and will never go back. We woke up to Atlantis the first morning out our balcony window and ships went by in front of it all day long. One thing that needs to change is the play. CATS. The staff is incredibly talented but the play plot itself has people escaping all the time. My biggest complaint was the water coffee every morning. They used to use Seattles Best which was great. Somewhere I heard they downgraded. Big Mistake! I was counting on my coffee and can't afford to do Starbucks each day. But all said and done, our trip was fantastic. I did not expect to like Port Canaveral but it was awesome. We used Smart Two shuttle for a water bottle chilled and air conditioned ride to and from airport. No herding us like cattle as in FT Lauderdale. We loved Smart Two shuttle. Also eat at Flamingos in Port Canaveral before your next day cruising. Delicious food and drink.
5.0	Sail Date: Apr 16, 2017 /	Had a great time. Staff was always smiling. Tons of stuff to do. Love the itinary every morning. It was spring break which was ok except parents should not be in bars with their 4 year olds at midnight.
5.0	Sail Date: Apr 16, 2017 /	Ship and staff were amazing! I've cruised 9 times but this was my first cruise with Royal Caribbean. I was so impressed. Food was fabulous and the ship didn't feel crowded. I loved everything about it. Central Park and the solarium were awesome.
4.0	Sail Date: Apr 16, 2017 /	Overall this was a wonderful experience.   My very first with my daughters and son-in-law.     Loved our balcony rooms and would be hard not to have same on next cruise.   Went on 3 excursions.   Liked the one on St. Maarten the best.    Had a very good tour guide.    At St. Thomas our driver left us waiting at least 30 or more minutes after he said we'd leave.  Many unhappy people about that.    Dining experience as so nice and our cabin Stewart was so helpful.  His name was Ranier.  And our delightful waiter was Nomer.    I do recommend this cruise to friends.
3.0	Sail Date: Apr 16, 2017 /	"The ship and crew were good. The stateroom (10626) was always clean and stocked as needed. The food quality in the main dining rooms was good and the waiter we had was great. 

 

The entertainment seemed to be sparse given the number of passengers on the cruise. We had reservations for the Aqua Show and were postponed twice due to rough sea and winds. Nothing was available in the now vacant time slots. If you go on this ship, reserve entertainment in advance - they do not have capacity for everyone. ""CATS"" was not that good (I'm being extremely generous); we left during intermission and many left prior to us.

 

Shore excursions were about the same as several other cruises we have taken with the same ports of call. One major difference with a large ship is the popular excursions are crowded and many sold out. We stood in line on the pier for over 30 minutes after start time in the hot sun waiting for our excursion buses. 

 

Elevators on the ship cannot accommodate the number of passengers. The choice is either wait or use stairs. For this reason, I advise everyone to review deck plans and determine which deck is best for your interests since you may be using stairs more than you'd think.

 

Embarkation and disembarkation were painless. We stayed in a Suite, so there was a separate line. For embarkation at Port Canaveral, we saw no real lines regardless of Suite Guest, or general boarding. For disembarkation at Port Canaveral, we did the self assist and were off before 8 am. There was a long line at Customs for non-suite guests; there was no line for suite guests.

 

Parking options are either at the pier ($128 for 7 day cruise) or offsite parking for much less. I'm not sure which is better since there was a significant traffic snarl trying to get into the parking garage at the pier and it took us almost 30 minutes to park (at the pier). It seemed offsite parking and shuttles to the ship may have been a better option for leaving port; upon return, we walked to the car in the garage and drove away with no delays.

 

The crew was professional and nice and the food in the dining room was good. The standard ""free"" dining options around the ship were always overcrowded. The wipeout cafe had ok burgers, fries, pizza, and dogs. Sorrentos pizza was a little like cardboard. The hot dog stand was good and the dogs seemed fine. They have a small Park Cafe with continental breakfast fare; it is good for egg muffin sandwiches, bagels, danishes, coffee, etc. We enjoyed the Solarium Bistro dining area, especially on day one after boarding. The Windjammer was typically overcrowded and several times we couldn't find a place to sit. Go early, or don't go at all to breakfast on port call days. We used the room service several mornings and ate on the balcony. It was nice. However, the menu is split - continental breakfast with no eggs is no additional fee; if you want eggs, omelettes, etc, it will cost you $7.95 per delivery to the stateroom. For us, it was worth $7.95 for the convenience and to avoid the breakfast crowds. Room service delivery was always during the time we requested; the food was hot; we got a call a few minutes before each delivery.

 

Overall, the Oasis Eastern Caribbean is  not a bad cruise. However, in my opinion, this cruise was not nearly as nice as the same itinerary a few years ago on Freedom of the Seas. If you are considering this as your first cruise, I recommend looking at a smaller ship to avoid getting a bad impression of what a cruise vacation can be like."
1.0	Sail Date: Apr 09, 2017 /	This was my 8th cruise on Royal Caribbean and I have never had crew members so rude to my wife and I. I am considering changing cruise lines after this cruise I have spent to much money with Royal to be treated this bad.
4.0	Sail Date: Apr 09, 2017 /	Too big and way way too many people, back to smaller ships for us!  Couldn't do all activities with the amount of people, lines and times available.  Also huge lines just to eat in the Windjammer and it's the worst Windjammer weve been in so far, poor selections and size of room for over 6k passengers! And the absolute worst ship departure day back home ever!!!  On a positive note, ship gorgeous and staff wonderful as usual, on every level, period!  Love RC!!
4.0	Sail Date: Apr 02, 2017 /	Very Nice ship! We were very disappointed to find there was no water slides or anything for the kids. Very difficult to get in the shows. We had fun but we will never go on Royal Caribbean again, for the money we paid for a grand suite we have gone on Carnival for half the price.
4.0	Sail Date: Mar 26, 2017 /	"The Chef's table was my favorite part of the cruise.  I really enjoyed the fabulous food throughout the ship.  Tlhe variety of activities to do, Shows, Bingo, Casino, Bars, smoking and non  smoking areas and excursions.  Also, the cleaniness of the ship and the very friendly staff.  The staff was always ready to help with anything we needed.  Also, I was impressed with how organized and efficient the boarding and unboarding process was planned.  It was easy for me to get off in different countries with my ""Seapass"" and also board back onto the ship.  Also at the end of the cruise, the communicatdion was excellent.  I knew exactly what I needed to do to make the process go smoothly.  Definitely plan on taking another Royal Caribbean Cruise soon."
5.0	Sail Date: Mar 26, 2017 /	We just returned from a fabulous time on the Oasis. My family loved the entertainment. My kids loved be dive show and come fly with me. The adults enjoyed the headliner show as well.  Food was good.  Plenty of activities for my kids to enjoy. Ship is so big we didn't see it all so we will have to book again in the future. Already have another cruise booked with RCI in 2 years for the southern Caribbean.
5.0	Sail Date: Mar 26, 2017 /	"The ship was awesome. Sea days are just as fun as port days. Awesome staff! Our room attendant was awesome. It seems he always was in the hall outside our room, opening the door for us and greeting us by name.  Every time we left the room ( even for a quick walk) the room was refreshed!  Gratuity was pre paid but remember to bring extra cash to reward great service. 

Food was awesome. I recommend chops grill and solarium bistro. 

Shows can not be put into words.

Pools were awesome, if you don't have kids find the solarium spas.

We have booked same cruise again with the kids going next time."
4.0	Sail Date: Mar 26, 2017 /	Our cruise on Oasis was an awesome one. We had great service  - consistent, interactive and friendly.  The weather was super too, which helped. We ate at many venues - Windjammer,  5 specialty and two of the cafes. I can't say the food was remarkable but well presented and we lucked-out with very engaging waiters.  There is lots to do.  We were surprised how much we liked the ice skating show and the Aquatheater show.  We sailed on Oasis a few years ago and we're lukewarm about it but this trip was great.
5.0	Sail Date: Mar 19, 2017 /	My first cruise with Royal and it was no disappointment! I have special dietary needs (vegan) and I let my head server know. They were so nice and every night I got a special, delicious treat and main course. They really spoiled me!! There were plenty of activities and pools to swim in. Great excursions for ports and everything was very organized! I immediately booked another cruise because it was truly the best cruising experience ever!
4.0	Sail Date: Mar 19, 2017 /	"Ok here are some basics: this was my first Royal cruise and second cruise of my short cruising career.  my other cruise was on a Disney boat - so that is my only base of comparison. I'm 46, married and brought my 2 kids and mother in law.

 

     The good:  The ship was amazing, huge and as spectacular as you could envision. It was hard to believe that there were 6,000 passengers on board, because the different venues for dining, entertainment and leisure were very nicely appointed, with there being plenty of room to move around.  The food overall was high quality.  The breakfasts and lunches at the Solarium and Windjammer were solid.  We did Hibachi one night and the quality of food and entertainment was on par or better than any land-based hibachi experience.  Johnny Rockets was also yummy.  My kids loved the milkshakes - and having a sip of one, i could understand why!

There are only a few things i would point out that could use improvement:  1- as a cruising newbie, I really wasn't clear about where we could dine for dinners and lunches outside of the Windjammer.  I needed more clarity - Like - ""Dining Venues included in your fare"" and the hours and descriptions of the experience.  It wasn't until the last day of the cruise that we went to the main dining room-and it was a much nicer place to eat.  I guess I could've asked someone but it seemed like they almost don't want you to know - so you'll go to their troughs elsewhere. Of course I certainly knew where I could go for a ""specialty dining"" experience.  There was no mystery there.      Also, we purchased the drink package - but found that champagne and fru-fru-drinks with umbrellas they were passing around were additional charges - and it seemed like I had to go out of my way to get drinks and wait for them.  I don't think I  drank my money's worth of the alcohol - so i'm not sure I would do that again.  If you drink steady all day and night, then definitely get the package.  If you're a drink with dinner type, then reevaluate your plan. 

My kids had the soda package and again, i would say that the number of coke machines around the place was inadequate.  The ice was often empty and there were always lines.  It seems to me for the amount spent on ensuring my kids can have their high-fructose corn syrup whenever they want, the actual supply exceeded the demand.  There were no signs, menus or info about where these machines were.  So again, i'd say more machines need to be installed or they shouldn't charge what they did.

 

The spa was lovely - and the staff was very friendly, professional and knowledgeable.  I had a mani/pedi with Taneesha - and my toes are still looking fabulous -  best pedicure ever.  I had massages and scrubs with Kathy and JoBeth - and those were also amazing.  The prices were fair.  My only complaint, and this is as much my fault as theirs, is that really push their spa products on you. It was like, ""madam, your skin is so dry and you have Cellulite...you need this scrub and this cream and I will get them for you and ok its $300 and i will charge to room ok sign here""    So im on a massage table with just a sheet and slightly vulnerable and my $155 massage turned into a $500+ day. They were pushy with the products.  But again, I could've said no.

 

Shore excursions were so-so.  St Thomas Catamaran snorkel tour was great - the staff was great.  The transfers between the ship and the excusion venues was not so nice. The bus/tram drivers were very crabby and bickering among themselves.  They herd everyone like cattle and treat the passengers like they are annoyed at being there.  I loved our snorkel tour.  I just didn't like getthing there and back.  One grouchy driver tried to herd my family onto the wrong bus and when i asked if it was going to the Oasis, he screamed, ""everyone is going to the same place!"" and was very rude.  We were on the wrong bus - and if he'd listened instead of shouted at us we could've avoided that unpleasantness altogether.

 

And finally, the entertainment was top notch.  Everything we saw or participated in was fabulous.  We saw the frozen in time, flight, and aqua shows. Each show was better than the next.  The talent of the performers was astounding.

 

Overall i would recommend this cruise.  Aside from some minor tweaks, I would definitely recommend this for active families and people of all ages."
3.0	Sail Date: Mar 12, 2017 /	The Oasis was very boring to me. My group that I sailed with was very upset with me and some the people stated they never want to cruise again. I explained to that it was not this boring the first time I did the ship....
4.0	Sail Date: Mar 12, 2017 /	This ship is huge, and was at full capacity, but still did not seem overcrowded.  Once we learned the layout, we could move about with ease.  Shows were excellent except for CATS.  Did not understand the plot line.  Had to Google it to know what I was looking at.  Really enjoyed the swimming and diving show to n the Aqua Theater.  We did the my time dining, and it was less than satisfactory.  Only four of us, but could never get the time we really wanted.  The food was about the same as other cruises that I have been on.  The Centerpiece Band in the nightclub Dazzle's was amazing.  We did not do any shore excursions from he ship, but found our own.  This worked out well.
4.0	Sail Date: Mar 12, 2017 /	"Overall the cruise was nicer than I was expecting as I have cruised 5 times before, but all being on Carnival.  The Oasis was a very clean and the employees were all nice and helpful.  I have two issues though.  The first being how long it took to finish dinner.  We had an 8PM seating and it was rare we were out before 10PM.  While they say to leave 2 hours for dining, our group sat for long periods of time just waiting to be served.  This was not the waiter's fault  Compared to Carnival it appears Royal needs to increase their staff at these meals.  Our waiter was literally running from table to table as were the others.  You just did not see as many wait staff as I have on other ships.  This resulted in a lot of time just wasted.  The other issue has to do with an excursion in Jamaica called ""A Day at Dolphin Cove"".  I don't feel this excursion was up to Royal's standards.  The almost hour drive to and from the site was not listed in the description.  The ""beach"" was horrible.  So rocky you needed water shoes to even attempt to get into the water.  Not what I would call a beach to relax on.  The ""mini zoo"" consisted of birds, rabbits, iguanas and a snake in a tank.  We only had 2-1/2 hours at the site, which was more than enough unfortunately, unless you swam with the dolphins.  Just very disappointed in this excursion.  Apparently Royal had many complaints about this one and was offering some partial refunds.  We were told we would get one, but haven't seen it yet."
3.0	Sail Date: Mar 12, 2017 /	OMG didn't realize it was spring break when we booked.  There were kids of all ages running all over the ship, most without parental guidance.  Food was wonderful as always and staff very helpful but ship seems to be going downhill.  The cruise director hasn't a clue as to how to schedule activities and it has become a sell, sell, sell atmosphere.  Will not be cruising again on the large ships.  We're  going to try Celebrity for our next two cruises this year along with MSC.
5.0	Sail Date: Mar 12, 2017 /	"Great cruise! Entertainment was really good even though Cats is a longgggg show. Production is great for Cats, but maybe time for something new. Journey tribute band ""Absolute Journey"" was fantastic! Food was really good. We ate at all of the speciality restaurants and were really impressed. The Solarium Bistro was nice and laid back. Maybe the best lamb chops I've ever eaten! Ate in the main dining area (American Icon) twice using My Time dining and was seated immediately.The food was surprisingly good both times here...I thought on par with some of the speciality restaurants. The key to problem free fun on the Oasis is to make reservations for EVERYTHING in advance. Dining, shows, etc. My advice is to do this online weeks or months before your cruise. That way you have the time to cross reference port stops, excursions and shipboard activities and make reservations to allow you to see and do almost everything. It worked out great for us! Take the time to do this and you'll have a great experience. Port stops:

1. Labadee, Haiti - good beach day and lots of activities. Typical lunch buffet with burgers, jerk chicken, ribs, etc. You can walk everywhere, but trams also run full time.

2. Falmouth, Jamaica - Most excursions are a 45 minute bus ride to Ocho Rios or a little closer to Montego Bay. We booked an excursion through RCL to Konoko Falls and Mystic Mountain. Fairly nice time, but if there are multiple ships in port be prepared for a longggg wait to ride the chairlift up the mountain. The falls were beautiful and not a bad climb. Not as high as Dunns River Falls. You can also walk up beside the falls on a safe wooden stairway.

3. Cozumel, Mexico - Always a great time for us! We went to Mr Sanchos beach resort about 10 minutes from the port. Not an RCL excursion. We booked online after reading reviews. We highly recommended. Took a taxi from the port ($17 for one way. 2 of us, but if you find someone else going you can split the fare 4 ways) to Mr Sanchos. You can either purchase an all inclusive for $55 per person which includes all drinks (alcohol & non-alcohol) all you can eat food (very large menu) lounge chairs for beach, kayaks, etc. or you can just do everything al la carte. We chose the all inclusive and don't regret. You'll be greeted by one of the many staff members who will set up your beach chairs, take your orders and bring you food and drinks all day long. Just tell them you'll take care of them at the end of day and all is good. Service was FANTASTIC. For $20 we virtually had a private butler. Beach is super clean and nice. Pools were great with swim up bars. Spa onsite with prices that make the ships spa prices look like extortion! Some great hammocks and lots of tiki huts. If you get there early you can get a tiki hut to yourself with your beach lounge chairs right in front. We got there at 8:30 AM, but it does get significantly more crowded as the day goes on, so tiki huts tend to get snatched up.

When you are ready to leave there are taxis lined up right outside the entrance and it's $17 back to ship. Easy to find riders to split the fare with. No problem getting back to the ship on time.

Oasis is a great ship. Never felt crowded even though nearly 6000 people on board. Always could find a lounge chair at pool. All of the staff interaction we had was great! Nothing negative to report. We were in Boardwalk Balcony stateroom 10719. Great view of Aqua Theater and activity on Boardwalk."
4.0	Sail Date: Mar 12, 2017 /	"Best part about this cruise was the FOOD!! A++ to the chefs on board. One negative would be the location of the drink machines.  For a ship this size they could stand to add a couple. 

Casino was fun and I love the non smoking and smoking being devided. Our room Stuart Andre was awesome! We did the first night done right package and ate at 150 central.  I had the black cod it was AMAZING. (And I'm not a huge fish fan. This was recommended by our waiter). 

The staff are friendly and helpful.  

My only complaint was within the details. Our room did not have our cups for the package, our Internet package was not there. We had to do some hinting for both. Other than that. Smooth saling."
4.0	Sail Date: Mar 05, 2017 /	"overall pretty good. Weather was so so and seas were rough the first few days. Surprised that s ship this size had do much of an issue. 

Service especially in the dining rooom was exceptional. Specialty restaurants were well worth the upcharge. Choice and preparation of food in main dining was extremely good. 

Cons were the constant selling of goods and services, ridiculous cost of drinks and the fact that you had to pay for sodas unless you bought a drink pkg which did not pay if you had one or two sodas daily or a couple of cocktails. 

Ship was impressive but could have used a little more room around the pool areas. Having to book shows in advance is an issue. Never had to do do on previous cruises. On the other hand entertainment was wonderful."
5.0	Sail Date: Mar 05, 2017 /	First time cruiser, Oasis of the seas was AMAZING. It was better than I expected it to be. All of the staff were fun, nice, professional! Shout out to Muharo &a Erwin in my time dining-definitely made our dining experience entertaining, Duvall was our State Attendant and he was great! We fell in love with all three of them and jaded saying goodbye 13 days ago.
5.0	Sail Date: Mar 05, 2017 /	spent a week sailing the high seas, with a great group of friends, so much to see and do, it takes a week to see most of the ship.  dazzles is a great place for after dinner drinks and music. hit every bar during a crawl, and crawling we did 19 spots to have a drink.
3.0	Sail Date: Mar 05, 2017 /	"When I first arrived, the ship was HUGE. It felt like little Las Vegas. Surroundings can get confusing the first 2 days then you become familiar, eventually.

I think some of the reviews I read before I went on the Sea of Oasis, were actually exaggerating on how great it was.

We did not have the best weather, especially with strong winds all week. Few times it rain and was cold in the am and pm. Their hot Jacuzzi tubs felt like a warm bath and it was NOT hot like normally it should. They could adjust the hot tub temp to warmer temp during cooler weather. I didn't feel relaxed with so many people. It was hard to get a good spot to lay down because people were hogging the beach chairs when they were actually gone somewhere else, not at the pool. The crews need to do something about that!!! So get up in the morning and reserved your spot with your towels, etc., before you head to breakfast. 

 

Their CATS show put me to sleep. It was that boring enough to leave before the intermission. Other shows were​ not too bad. The water show kept getting canceled due to weather. They didn't really have a good dancing club to go to. Most of the time, I didn't see that many people dancing. I was itching to dance but didn't have the vibe to do it. They should have dance instructors to lead people into dancing and make it fun. 

 

At first, I was enjoying variety of their food selections but then it became the same thing every day, especially breakfast and lunch. Dinner at Silk was good. They do introduce to different new menu as well as the same menu daily. Their service was awesome. Always friendly and willing to serve you even if you arrived late. (My bad)

 

If you like drinking non-alcohol or alcohol beverages daily, definitely get the package. Their single price is expensive and will add up twice more than the package price itself. If you like to drink water, buy the water bottle packages before the cruise with cheaper deal. It cost twice more once you are already onboard. 

 

Overall, it was fun and lots to do, especially exploring the ship. The ship may seemed big enough for that many amount of people but still, it gets crowdy at times. It was worth the experience but I wouldn't go again as soon. If you like the hustle bustle and non-enthic experience. then its a trip for you. But if you like to relax or get the culture experience, do the all inclusive resort land travel."
5.0	Sail Date: Mar 05, 2017 /	Awesome ship got back march 2017. Booked it again for November 12. Some much to do and see. Food was great entertainment was great We felt the need to go again ,
5.0	Sail Date: Feb 26, 2017 /	"Had a great cruise with the the exception of the averge age of the guests. We have never cruised this time of year and we'll,  it's not a younger crowd.  I'm 50 and wife is 52.  We were probably the youngest on the ship.  And it sort of has its advantages. ....no late nite screaming drunk fests.   Naked girls jumping into pool ( not that that is a bad thing)  But sometimes we need a little encouragement to live it up from the younger ones.  One issue is that with the older crowd is medical emergencies. We had 4 Alpha calls and 2 medical evacuations.  One was a 2 helicopters medivac off the Labadee pier. Very windy and chopper had to wave off the landing twice.  Second medivac was out of Jamaica. We were underway for about 1 hour and Captain Rob informed us that we needed to return to Jamaica to get a medical emergency off the boat.  We even had a emergency call while at sea, anybody that had blood type  O-Positive to report to guest services.  

 

The dinner times were chosen for us by a group we were traveling with.  530p. Ugh. Never again!!  We always choose My Time Dining and used it for the remaining 5 days after the fixed time was a disaster. Felt like hoarded cows being fed. Head waiter Slaney fixed us up every night after we voiced our displeasure on the fixed time.  Really made us enjoy our dinners!  

The entire crew that we saw was smiling and greeted us if we made eye contact. Had a problem with this on our last cruise on Freedom of the Seas. Couldn't find a smile from anyone.  I know that the job probably sucks, but we paid a good penny for a service and expect a level for it.

 

Cabin steward was delightful. Cynthia was her name.  Wife blew out her knee 1 week before cruse and she needed to ice it down a few times each day.  She made sure it was full and ready everytime we arrived at our room.  

 

We visited Labadee,Jamaica and Cozumel .  Visited this locations on previous cruises. Only disappointed with Jamaica. We did the Bamboo Beach Club VIP excursion. It was a waste of 80 x 2 bucks. 1 hr drive which is an adventure all in its own. Actually I think they should offer a 1 hr drive in an oversized bus as an excursion. The drivers are freaking maniacs!!!!  Anyway the beach club was not anything we expected. We were thinking a flat beach. Nice lounge chairs. Umbrellas,   buffet line of food, endless drinks of our choice. Ummmmmm,  not really. Wood lounge chairs with soaking wet covers. Uneven beach with roots everywhere. No Umbrellas so had to find shade from a tree.  Surf was brutal. Sharp rocks and a 10 foot drop-off 15 feet from shore.   Drinks were plenty as long as you liked red stripe or some blue and red concoction overflowing with alcohol.   Food was on 4 inch plates and was brought to us by waiters and waitresses one course at a time. Brochure said unlimited drinks and food. I guess it was but not as quick as ""unlimited implies""  would not recommend this excursion to anyone.

 

The Oasis is a remarkable ship.  Except for the occasional rocking which is expected on any ship. Lots to do. Only thing I wish it had was a free sauna or steam room. Only available one was 79 bucks for a couple in the Vitality Spa.  UGH.....

 

Had a state room facing front of ship. 2 decks below the Bridge. One advantage was that the room was about 30feet deep.  The slanted window gave us so much more room. I do not like to live out a suitcase but there was so little room for storage that we just lined up the wall with our luggage and still had plenty of move around room.  Only caveate is that the front of the boat tends to move quite a bit.  I enjoy the rocking but wife not so much. We ran into some strong winds on our way back from Cozumel to Port Canaveral and we encountering 10 feet seas with a head wind of about 25kts. Made for a noisy night of sleep.

 

Took the All Access tour of Ship. I would recommend this tour to anybody interested an the inner workings of the ship. 

 

All in All. The cruise ws an enjoyable one.  Heading out in Sept on a 7 night on Allure out of Ft Lauderdale. Hopefully a younger crowd."
5.0	Sail Date: Feb 26, 2017 /	"Cruise/vacation reviews common complaints are:

-Too many old people

-Too many young people/partiers (avoid spring break anywhere)

-No loungers open at pool/chairs savers

-Hard to find tables to sit at buffet food areas (Windjammer RCL)

-Ship rocks/windy/skipped port or island stops

-Quality of food/service/embark/disembark

-Too many people trying to sell you something on the ship or in ports

-Medical evacuations or ship delayed/turned around – Be Thankful it was not you or someone in your family!

Unfortunately, vacationing anywhere will have these same complaints.  We are now caught up in a world where they nickel and dime you for everything as it is no longer included.  Sad that we need to lower our expectations.  We are also living in a time where instant gratification is expected and “it’s all about me”.

 

If you are still with me here is some basic tips to get the most out of your vacation:

-Take a few breaths, expect to wait to check in, get food, service, etc no different than at home, restaurant, store or hotel

-Common courtesy for all, hold the elevator or door, move out of the way, assist someone who needs help, respect that not everyone wants to talk or hear you talk loud

-Greet service staff, make conversation with them:

            “It must be just crazy in here for a few hours checking us all in – do you all go out for a drink after”

            “Hi, how is your day going”

            “I see that you have been so busy, how challenging that must be every day”

            “Looks like we all had the same idea to come and get a drink from you”

            “How often do you get back home/see family/get off the ship”

We had a competition going with one room steward over towel animals and would jazz it up for him the next day!  An epic ending we left for him when we left the ship.  Another’s family member just had a stroke and she was thankful that her home town was one of the ports so she could visit him.

-I know they charge service charges but plan to bring extra cash.  We always give $ to the room steward at the beginning I like ice cold water and drinks – so I would have that in my room twice a day.  Tip the bartenders, they remember your favorite drink and would get it too you faster.  Reward again at the end if you so choose.  I find the same people who are stingy to restaurant wait staff are the same on a cruise, hotel etc.

-If you want to relax don’t feel like you have to do everything - out of the way lounge chairs/areas are the best. Likewise if you are looking to find people your age seek them out, stop by all bars, clubs, lounges, activities – practice the art of conversations, have some key questions to ask.  Your vacation is what you make of it and your attitude.

-Remember to enjoy the time off, relax and spend time with the ones you are with, after all isn’t that why you went on vacation."
5.0	Sail Date: Feb 26, 2017 /	Just got off the oasis had a great time the ship is truly amazing we did have a few incidents though several injuries on dunns falls beware this excursion is only safe for the physically fit it requires climbing on slippery rocks there were broken ankles and such please understand this cruise was made up of over 80 percent very old senior citizens walkers and all I cruise a lot and this is a first for me when we left Cozumel we were about an hour underway and had to turn around and go back to Cozumel to evacuate a passenger everyone of the officials had full face masks on when handling her there were 17 passengers quarantined for the cruise with the flu but when you think about it there were more then 5500 passengers and over 2000 crew members there are bound to be hiccups the food in the dining room was perfect in every way tasty and perfect in every way the room steward we had was great the staff in the dining room was terrific thank you seri from Thailand it is imperative that you book early for shows on the boat comedy club etc the casino sets there slots way to tight don't expect to win much folks this is the largest ship in the world but don't kid yourself it rocks and rolls from the moment we left till we got back we were in rough seas and high winds they closed deck 15 and 16 a lot and the captain had the pedal to the metal most of the time 22 knots or better especially after the turn around in Mexico this is one time the captain should have used his head and gone to different ports where the weather was not so rough in labadee my family could not do the jet ski tour which we booked way in advance they sent us to the zip line where we signed in and were told to wait 1 hour for the next class to begin when we went to that we were told the weight limit had been changed again where some in my party could not go labadee was a bust I love the ship I love royal but I feel the blame for the problems we had fall right at the captains feet oh and by the way the itinerary for the oasis for the next cruise that left after ours changed completely sailing to the Bahamas and stops in the eastern Caribbean obviously staying out of the Gulf of Mexico ah well such is life
4.0	Sail Date: Feb 26, 2017 /	"This was our first experience with RC, as we had previously sailed the affordable Carnival. I do believe you get what you pay for and will keep that in mind in the future. My contacts with my cruise coordinator weren't favorable. I had Ellen and I felt whenever I had to contact her with questions, that it was a burden for her. I sensed she had been doing her job for a long time and didn't enjoy it anymore. Knowing she would receive credit if I booked another cruise while on the cruise, gave me pause. I wouldn't care to work with her again. My Carnival cruise coordinator provided incredible service, so I was quite disappointed with Ellen, and communicate this to RC through a survey prior to the cruise. No one ever reached out to me. 

With that said, the Oasis ship itself was FANTASTIC. The food and entertainment and variety were TOP NOTCH. I can not express enough how incredible the entertainment was. There is always something going on. I had my time dining and was placed with a group of retirees the first night. Instead of being disappointed with my company, I took this as an opportunity to glean some wisdom. We had a nice meal, but did opt for a more intimate dining setting the other two times we went to the dining room. 

The staterooms were perfectly sized for two for a week. We had Deck 11, room 224. It was on the port side, but never overlooked the port. Too funny. It felt private and many nights we slept with the door open and the waves crashing. 

The staterooms attendants I passed on our deck didn't seem very friendly. No one acknowledged us unless we acknowledged them first. This included our attendant, who disappeared after the first couple of days. We never saw him again, but our room was being serviced. That was strange to me. But whatever. 

We had an incredible time on this cruise and if I had to do it all over again, I would without a pause. However, RC may need to do some training with their staff on customer service if they truly want to roll over their competition. RC ha s the best ship and entertainment, but Carnival blows them out of the water in customer service."
4.7	Sail Date: Feb 19, 2017 /	We loved the cruise and the ship was over the top.  We liked it so much we decided to go on another Oasis class in 2018 and have it booked with some family members.  If you're interested in the ship itself make sure to take the behind the scenes tour.
5.0	Sail Date: Feb 19, 2017 /	The cruise was everything I could have ever imagined! So fun!! I became very close with a couple of the photographers and now we are best friends and they made the week so much more enjoyable! Wish I could give this ship 10 stars!!
4.0	Sail Date: Feb 19, 2017 /	Our favorite part of the cruise was the people working on the cruise, they were genuinely interested in us and that we were being taken care of and they did it with a smile.  The ship itself has plenty to do for people of all ages.  We had five in our group aging from 22 thru 65.  The evening entertainment was the best we have seen in the five cruises we have been on.  On this trip we stayed with the provided dining, the service and food were exceptional with a great variety and the people serving it were knowledgeable and very attentive.   The only drawback was the time in ports of call, it could have been several hours longer as the excursions took up most of the time so there was little time to explore on our own.  All in all a wonderful trip on the Oasis of the Sea, we look forward to our next trip with Royal Caribbean.
4.0	Sail Date: Feb 19, 2017 /	We have cruised with Royal 3 times before. This was our first time on the Oasis. Loved our boardwalk balcony room. The ship is huge with lots going on. At times it felt a little disorganized compared to the smaller ships. The music on the pool deck was okay. If you wanted to see the belly flop contest or world sexiest man contest you had to leave the pool deck and go to the back of the ship to the aquatic theatre. On the smaller ships everything happens right at the main pool deck. The shows were top notch. We had reservations for all of them which is highly recommended. Food was okay. The Windjammer seemed smaller and we dined at 5:15 in the my time dining and service seemed slow. Our wait staff was awesome just seemed to be to many people dining at once.  Will definitely stick to the Freedom Class ships. Freedom of the seas is my favorite.
5.0	Sail Date: Feb 19, 2017 /	"Love the Oasis class. The food this week has been great. The entertainment has been worth seeing twice. Book your reservation for the shows online before you board. 

Yes, the size can be intimidating. Every deck has its own art. Learn the art on your stateroom deck and the style of artwork in the elevator that is closest to your stateroom. This will help. Also, the car on deck 5 points to the bow of the ship. 

Port or starboard. Port is the small word so are left and men. Men's restrooms are to port. 

Starboard is of course the big word. As are right and women. Women's restrooms are to starboard. 

Enjoy your cruise!"
4.0	Sail Date: Feb 12, 2017 /	The Oasis is the biggest cruise ship I've been on so far. There were plenty of things to do on board while at sea and the ports of call were fun as well. The food on the ship was also really good. We ate dinner most nights in our dining room but did also eat at Chopswhich was totally worth the extra money
3.0	Sail Date: Feb 12, 2017 /	We've traveled on the Oasis a few times now an it seems to be deteriorating somewhat.  Entertainment has gone down.  And communication is failing.  Food is still excellant. Entertainment is lackng.  It's all sell, sell, sell.  Nothing but Latin dancing.  We'll e on it again next month and can only hope it will be better.  Will be trying their sister company, Celebrity.   They offer you more.
5.0	Sail Date: Feb 05, 2017 /	We absolutely love cruising. It's so relaxing and allows you to forget the world for a little while. The Caribbean is always a great place to cruise.
4.0	Sail Date: Feb 05, 2017 /	Solarium has private pools for just adults, was great, saw no children. There were children in the hot tub's but they were supervised by their parents, did not go to the big pools. Main dining room was good but Windjammer was always very crowded. I also found that the solarium, American grill,Johnny's, and that great roast beef sandwich on the promenade deck very good. Though that shops could have a better variety then what was offered. Won in the casino. Drinks always flowing if you had the package and most entertainment was very good.
5.0	Sail Date: Feb 05, 2017 /	Favourite part of cruise was the 70's street party, followed by the snorkellling excursion on St Thomas, then the flow rider. The room was interior yet perfectly sufficient in size; with all that ship to explore, why would you want to be spending any more time in your room than absolutely necessary. The staff were all amazingly happy and friendly; I really don't know how they keep there spirits up so much with working everyday for 6 or 7 months at a time! All in all, it was everything we were hoping for and more
4.0	Sail Date: Feb 05, 2017 /	The Oasis of The Seas was our first experience with a larger ship and Royal Carribean. all in all our cruise was enjoyable and I would recommend this ship to anyone.
2.0	Sail Date: Feb 05, 2017 /	"I was told that you won't real know that there are 6,000 people on-board.  Not true.  You definitely know there is.  Every place you go, there are lines. This number of people also causes challenges to dining.  Not for dinner but for breakfast and lunch.  There is no way the Windjammer restaurant could handle the volume so they have numerous other venues offering meals.  But, unless you go to each one, you don't know their offerings.  One has fried eggs cooked to order, the others don't.  One only has pastries.  And they all open and close at different times.

 

All these things make everything feel very disjointed. Will never cruise on an Oasis class ship again."
5.0	Sail Date: Jan 29, 2017 /	"The ship and the shows were great.  The ship had a lot to offer both in entertainment and in what all she had to offer to all ages of folks.

The ice skating show, headliner show and the diving were superb.  ""Cats"" was well done, of Broadway quality, with great staging and costumes.

The food was good overall.  The Windjammer was a bit of a let down.  The food they served at lunch was often dull -no color except browns basically in presentation of main courses -a lot of stew like entrees - and not all that good in flavor, either.   Too much India culture cuisine was served.  

The main dining room food was very good but not exceptional.  It is a pity that so many of the cruise lines have down graded the evening meal and have gone to specialty restaurant with high pricing in order for you to get the exceptional food that once was commonly served during the evening meal during my earlier cruising days."
2.0	Sail Date: Jan 29, 2017 /	"Everything was phenomenal right up until the last night where there was an incident in the casino.  From the start of the cruise, there was an abusive and obnoxious gambler who only played craps.  Having lost HUGE amounts of money 3 weeks prior, he was back (and very well known to staff).  I ventured to the craps table on the first night, and after having rolled a few 7's at the wrong time, costing this ""gentleman"" at least $2,500 in the process, I was subjected to being yelled at, sworn at and then told how to throw the dice.  I felt very intimidated in a game that I love to play.  I chose not to play again for the remainder of the cruise when he was at the table.

Playing various other table games throughout the week, you would always hear this a**h**** yelling, blaspheming and swearing - and it was just accepted.

However, on the last night, I decided I had had enough and went to watch the craps table.  I was standing 3 spots away from this man, and a Chinese gentleman leant forward, and put his head over the edge, looking down at the table as this pig of a man was about to roll the dice.  He rolled a 7, and lost another $700 at least.  He yelled and swore at the Chinese man, blaming him for the 7, and I responded by saying ""with respect, anyone can stand where ever they want in this Casino"".

He turned to me and yelled ""With respect, I wasn't talking to you, so don't talk to me"".

Again, I said ""No Sir, with all due respect, anyone can stand where ever the hell they want to in this Casino"".

He yelled even louder at me and said ""WITH RESPECT, I WASN'T F***ING TALKING TO YOU, SO DON'T F***ING TALK TO ME"".

I looked at him and said ""Seriously, just shut the f*** up"". 

He turned to me, puffed out his chest and stood right in my face yelling ""WHAT THE F*** DID YOU JUST SAY TO ME?""

At this point, I was thinking I am going to punch him out if he touches me. I turned away and 2 casino staff members ran over and pull him and I apart.

He continued yelling and wearing and I walked away to go and speak to the Casino Host, who immediately apologized and said that his behavior was and has been completely unacceptable. I asked what was going to be done about it, so he called the Casino Manager to come and speak to me.

The Manager shook my hand, apologized and said that he would go and speak to this man, which never happened.  I immediately realized, that I am merely and small little nothing who would leave the ship, and go away the next day, but this man, who lost over $60K 3 weeks ago, is WAY more important than me, given that according to Royal Caribbean, money buys power, and allows you to abuse staff and fellow passengers.

After this incident, 3 Casino staff members came up to me and either shook my hand, high-fived or fist pumped me and thanked me for standing up to him and saying something. 

Another thing struck me - again, Royal Caribbean will choose money over the right thing, and allow this man to abuse their staff, as he is a cash cow, and it doesn't matter who he verbally abuses in the process.

That's when I decided to formally lay a complaint with Guest Services.  They were very helpful and understanding, and I then had to write a report and video interview with security, who took this matter over.

I was told that this man was taken aside and underwent GCP (Guest Conduct Protocol), but that is because I followed up hours later.  No-one from the ship called my room to apologize or explain what happened, which to me, is disgusting.

As far as security is concerned, the matter is closed and there is no more action, but where does that leave me? 

I went on the cruise to celebrate my 20th wedding anniversary with my wife, and the whole joy and excitement of the trip, was ruined by Royal's handling of the situation.

I called Post Cruise customer service yesterday and spoke to an agent Candy, who should go on training about customer service.  She was so rude and condescending - I asked to speak to a supervisor, and she deemed my matter too insignificant to escalate and refused.  I asked her for her employer ID number and last name, to which she refused again, and told me she is the only Candy in Post Cruise Customer Service.

I am so disgusted that Royal Caribbean would tolerate such rude, abusive behavior on board, but it is clear to me that their mission statement is ""MONEY TALKS""."
5.0	Sail Date: Jan 22, 2017 /	Had a fantastic time. Beautiful ship.  Large but never seemed to large to us.  Ship was full but nothing ever seemed crowded.  Couldn’t have had a better time.
4.0	Sail Date: Jan 22, 2017 /	It was for sure my favorite cruise out there it had everything that I needed and it was extremely entertaining the food was great except for the fancy dinner foods
4.0	Sail Date: Jan 22, 2017 /	The ship, St. Thomas and St. Maarten. MyTime does not work on a ship this size. It was catastrophy had everyone complaining about it. The safety of the passengers meant a chamge in the first port due to the wind and tornado in Port Canaveral and the Bahamas. Thank you Captain and crew.
5.0	Sail Date: Jan 22, 2017 /	Loved the ship. Staff always friendly and helpful. Our stateroom attendant (11151) was very, very kind and helpful. Food was good in the Windjammer and the American Icon dining room. Overwhelmingly big, but easy to get around. Always something going on. We bypassed Nassau because of weather, but went to Old San Juan instead, and unexpected surprise. Our excursions on St. Thomas and St. Maarten were excellent. They only rude people we encountered were other passengers. Over 6,200 passengers.
3.0	Sail Date: Jan 15, 2017 /	the ship was nice....but charge for every thing.... food was ok the people were great on the boat the shows were really great... When we booked sa tour in Jamaica  we spent 160.00 for the both of us...It did not tell us that they take you to off the beaten path for pictures that way they get a kick back for bringing guests to a spot that had a bar had a slow bus took 2 STINKIN hours to get to the beach we did the delux Bambo beach break V I P package and on the way back tried to MAKE US go to a **** ****  of a shopping place...Once again she would get a kick back WE ALL said NO we are not getting off the bus and she told us WER HAVE TO and we would not get off..We barely made the boat and could not shop at the pier SUCKED.Royal needs to investigate the tour because it was a 160.00 in misleading tour description..We and the bus group would of NEVER of taken a tour that put us all in a SLOW ***** Bus for 3 hours and 45 minutes long. Did not get any JAMAICAN feel on the island. SUCKED and will never go to that port again.
5.0	Sail Date: Jan 15, 2017 /	Incredible ship!! The minute we stepped on board was like stepping on to paradise. The stunning decor, the buzzing atmosphere and the excellent staff all made our trip so enjoyable. There were areas of the ship that we didn't get around to seeing as we just didn't have time to fit everything in. The water shows were excellent as the auditorium itself was incredible. The only negative (I use the term negative loosely) was, compared to the smaller ships, the Oasis lost the level of intimacy. As theres so many more passengers on board it's kind of impossible for staff to keep the personal touch intact. On the smaller ships, staff remember passenger names etc. Dining is a lot more disorganised too, even when we had reservations each night, we still had to stand in line. Apart from this it's a wonderful ship and truly magical experience.
3.0	Sail Date: Jan 08, 2017 /	Can someone tell me the meaning or significance of &nbsp. I see this in many posts. Also '. I've tried to figure it out. I must keep typing because I need 150 characters.
5.0	Sail Date: Dec 31, 2016 /	"It is my second time with the Oasis an we had a great time. The staff is really caring and we never had a problem getting anything. The only issue that I had was with the time we stay in Puerto Rico. It was to short and we couldn't do anything. I wish they can resolve that for the future because the island have a lot to offer and people will appreciate more time to explore and go to different places and beaches. I would like to take a moment to name couple of staff that make my time in the cruise exceptional. Those staff are from the Irish pub Edwin, great person and he knows how to serve you that you feel like you are in your house chatting and drinking with your friends. The other person was Johana, she is full of energy and in the morning when you enter in the Winjammer she gave you that energy to continue with the day. Johanna use to sai "" No Wachi, Wachi, No Foodi, Foodi"" she was unbelievable. We are now ready for our next cruise and we booked this one onboard. YESSSSSSS."

5.0	Sail Date: Dec 04, 2016 /	I had just completed my tenth cruise with Royal Caribbean on Harmony of the Seas! It was amazing! But I just want to keep going back to the Oasis. We’ve been on it twice. Feels like a home away from home. The staff, staterooms, food, and cleanliness have always been spot on. Our favorite spot was the Umbrella bar on the Boardwalk. Something the Harmony doesn’t have to due to the Abyss.
4.0	Sail Date: Nov 20, 2016 /	"Love this cruise/ship
Identical to allure in almost every way! My 12 year old son and 10/13 year old nieces had a blast! My sister n law sang karaoke almost every night! Food was good, service was good- although both were just a touch better on Anthem than on this ship! Shows were phenomenal:) highly recommend this ship, in particular for families! :)"
5.0	Sail Date: Nov 20, 2016 /	Oasis is our favorite ship!!! We've sailed on her twice now and she doesn't disappoint. Food, crew, accommodations, ship itself all were impeccable both times we sailed. With the addition of Harmony and Symphony soon the price of Oasis is going down from what it used be...which is awesome for us anyway. If you haven't tried a larger ship definitely try Oasis. Tip: while higher stateroom decks may seem appealing try for a stateroom on deck 7 or 8. You're close to everything without always having to wait for an elevator just up or down a floor or two on the stairs and you're there (except the pool deck and windjammer). We spend a lot of time in the promenade, boardwalk and Central Park.
5.0	Sail Date: Nov 20, 2016 /	"Great ship! It's very large and runs slightly different then other ships instead of one main buffet there is the windjammer which is the ""main"" buffet and can be very crowded especially on the first few days but there are smaller buffets like caffe promenade and park caffe. Central Park is amazing and relaxing. The boardwalk was fun and the carousel is something everyone should do at least once. The pools in the lido deck are never cowed due to the amount of pools that they have. The Royal Promenade is great. Can't wait to go on the allure 6 months to go!"
5.0	Sail Date: Nov 13, 2016 /	I have been on this ship a few times now, with another cruise booked for August 2018. I absolutely love it, have not been on the newer ships yet but so far the Oasis is my favorite
5.0	Sail Date: Nov 13, 2016 /	"The My Time dinning service was the fast. We booked the same dinning time each day and requested the same table the entire trip. The trick is once the doors open do not wait in line, go directly to your table. Getting off the ship was fast. We had tag 14

to get off the ship and had 7 bags, we got a porter who took us all the way up front by passing at lest 500 people in line going thru customs saving at lest 30 minutes if not more."
4.0	Sail Date: Nov 05, 2016 /	Overall, I learned that I like sailing on smaller ships such as Freedom of the Seas. Even though Oasis is huge, I just felt so crowded. The service & food was okay. However, there was a lot to do and I enjoyed myself!
3.0	Sail Date: Nov 05, 2016 /	"Overall, our experience with this cruise was good. The ship itself is beautiful. It includes certain features which sets them apart from other cruise ships. For example, Oasis has a ""central park"" area which has live plants and adds a nice 'earthy' aroma to the environment. It was nice to walk through at night with greenery all around, specialty shops& restaurants, and live music. This boat also includes a 24/7 golf course, flow riders, a zip line, rock climbing, ice skating rank, and aqua theater. The size and design of this ship provides an easy flow of traffic and the only time it felt congested was before or after headliner shows.

 

The royal promenade was the main shopping area in the ship. It is huge, and the cruise conducts discount sales almost daily. There are several bars in this area all with different vibes. The champagne bar is elegant and glamorous, the schooner bar is a nice area to overlook the promenade and is especially fun at night with live piano music, boleros is a fun dancing bar, and finally on air is a nice place to sit back and watch sports or to participate in daily games.

 

The boardwalk felt like you were walking down the strip in California. The carousal was beautiful and was surrounded by a specialty hot dog restaurant, Saboros (Mexican), candy shops, beach shops, etc. The end of the boardwalk led to the aqua theater and rock wall.

 

I could go on and on about everything there is to see/do on this ship, but what impressed us the most was the service provided in the main dining room. Sherman, Olga, and Guilherme were fantastic and the surrounding waitstaff were excellent as well. Being in the service industry myself, I know it's hard to always have a smile on your face when you're having a bad day or to maintain ""the customer is always right attitude,"" with people who are just being completely rude. But the waitstaff clearly strived to be professional, personable, friendly, and thus they positively attributed to our experience.

 

We preferred the food in the main dining room which was consistently good. We dined at Giovanni's (Italian restaurant) and the food there was excellent. We also tried Izumi (sushi/hibachi) and found the food to be just okay.

 

One major decline on this ship was the entertainment. I'm sadden to say this because we expected it to match up with everything else on the ship but unfortunately we were more entertained at Karaoke than we were during the shows. Al Romas, the comedian who had a show every night, was a huge disappointment. We saw him three times and its such a shame that we could predict the joke he was about to tell. All three times he used the same material and only veered off when someone in the audience had a different answer than the norm. I wish he could have developed more original material because he is funny but when you are the opening headliner, closing headliner, and performing in your nightly venue, you need to use different jokes.

 

Cats the musical was 2 hours long. It was boring and a show I've heard the ship has had for years. Although I can appreciate the stamina and talent of the cast, I saw many people walk out due to the dullness. We couldn't even make it through to intermission. This cruise ship is making so much money so why are you putting on the same show 3 times during an 8 day cruise!?

 

We did enjoy the Frozen on ice show and the aqua theater production however, yet again we heard from several cruisers that it's the same choreography. Needless to say their entertainment is dated and with a cruise line charging cruisers so much you would expect a variety of shows and an authentic performance.

 

Oasis is a beautiful ship but with the prices they charge, everything should be top notch."
5.0	Sail Date: Nov 05, 2016 /	"oasis-of-the-seas Nov 5th 2016. First cruise out of Port Canaveral  for 8 days to Labadee,  Jamaica,  Costa  Maya and Cozumel.

We had a great time in an oceanview balcony room on deck 11. We ate dinner  in the main dining room twice, the Windjammer once and specialty  restaurants  the rest of the time.  We did not prebuy a restaurant  package because we had on board credit to spend. Once on board they were selling 3 dinners for $90. We chose Giovanni's  Table, Izumi and 150. Giovanni's  was very good. We chose the Hibatchi dinner at Izumi. Shrimp and beef combination was sensational. The 6 of us in our group all agreed this was our best meal. 150 was a complete dissapointment. The beef short rib  was small and cooked like a roast with no sides. The waiter had bragged about the squash soup. It didn't  live up to the hype. Desert was ok but didn't  save the experience.

On Monday we were sitting in the promenade and were approached and offered a discount for the Solarium Bistro.  First he offered 40% off. We hesitated and he went to 50% off plus he said we could get the lobster for free if we came on Tuesday  which was the normal lobster night in the main dining room. Normally they get  another $5 for the lobster. We agreed to purchase and go on Tuesday. I can say it was a great choice as the meal and experience  was great.

All the shows were very good too. I am not too interested in sitting for 2.5 hours but I did it for CATS. I can't  get excited about the story but every singer and dancer were quite good and in that context I enjoyed the show. The quality of entertainment justifies the premium the ship costs as well as the interest provided by the neighborhoods.

I  had a personal priority to go to Sabor. We had experienced  Sabor on Freedom of the Seas and it was so good we couldn't  wait to go again. The menu on Oasis was not the full menu we had on Freedom. Instead of it being one price it was a-la-cart. They treated this venue more like a place for a snack instead of a specialty restaurant. With all we did during the week, Sabor fell through the cracks. The smaller menu just wasn't as compelling to us.

 

On Thursday, day 6, I saw them offering a drink card for $79. That's ten drinks that anyone can use. We didn't make the purchase but I know some readers want to know if it was offered."
5.0	Sail Date: Oct 29, 2016 /	Nice ship! Took a bit to learn the layout. The ship was clean and employees were exceptionally great! Food & service was excellent. Stateroom service top notch!
2.0	Sail Date: Oct 29, 2016 /	The ship is beautiful BUT has changed in the past 4 years.  Food was not as good and now you have to pay extra in main dinning if want better selection.  Also the speciality restaurants prices went up to $35 and $40 dollars and you don't get choice of everything. Again must pay additional amount of $20 plus for Lobster and selected meals.  Some Entertainment was same as 4 years ago. Cat's  show was long and boring. People walked out at intermission. They were not as informative as other ships.  They do not enforce formal night. People came to main dinning room with shorts and T shirts.  Not fair to though who took the time to bring formal wear and more then half not dress up. Not much activity by pool.  I was very disappointed and will not cruise this ship again. Was told making cuts on all Royal Caribbean ships including staff.  Service was weak. I think I will cruise Princess for now on. Great food and entertainment.
5.0	Sail Date: Oct 22, 2016 /	This was my first EXPERIENCE on a mega ship and it was simply amazing..... this ship is massive and beautiful and so much to do.... show to food the EXPERIENCE awesome.....
4.0	Sail Date: Oct 15, 2016 /	My sister and I just returned from 7 days Eastern Caribbean on the Oasis of the Seas. Let me just start my saying we are from south Florida and should have known better than to book a cruise for October. I honestly would steer clear of October since it is very rainy even in the Caribbean. We had 2 1/2 days of SUN out of 7 but the ship made up for that. The ship is hands down amazing. The best show on the ship is Come Fly With Me!!! Then the ice skating show and then the Oasis of Dreams show which is a spectacular water show. AMAZING! I promise you these shows will make you feel like you are watching Olympic type professionals. They did a fine job. The food was delicious every where you went. Wind Jammer was nice and had a lot of variety. My only complaint is the service in the Park café for lunch is horrible. The servers were not nice and not helpful at all. They ran out of chips and when you asked questions you got attitude. Everyone else on board greeted you with a smile and were pleasant. My one complaint with Royal is that they close the windjammer to early between lunch and dinner. They closed for lunch at 3:30pm and the only place open for a meal was the Hot Dog stand and Park café. These are complimentary places to eat unless you pay to eat somewhere else. I found that to be an inconvenience because everyone crowded in like cattle to Park café for salad, soup, and sandwiches which by the way the roast beef sandwich was superb!!! Additional advice if you are using your debit card you will have a plethora of holds on your card. Say you bought something for $20.00 they hold $60.00! it makes no sense to me, but it is a lesson learned and we will put cash on our seapass account next time. Oh and if you are going to St. Maarteen be prepared to get bombarded on the beach with woman every 1 min asking you to buy stuff. They do not care if your eyes are closed and you are relaxing, they keep asking!!! I understand that may be there source of income but if I said no politely 10x then why ask again. Royal may want to consider stopping to them as the second trip rather than the last, as many items they were selling many ppl purchased in St. Thomas ( hats, shirts, bags, etc). I do try and support every island so we ate and drank while we were there :). St Thomas is a beautiful island and our tour guide Gwenneth was the BEST and she took us around for 3 1/2 hours for $25.00 can not beat that!!! she took us everywhere to every nook and crennie on the island.
5.0	Sail Date: Oct 08, 2016 /	Un barco que lo tiene todo!!!!! Aun siento que no pude ver todo y que tengo que volver. El Parque Central es hermoso y tiene unas vistas expectaculares. Deben darse la oportunidad.
5.0	Sail Date: Oct 08, 2016 /	"Cruised on Oct. 8, 2016 as Hurricane Matthew moved North past Ft. Lauderdale.  RC delayed departure to give folks time to deal with flight delays which had the added benefit of a beautiful sunset departure.  

 

First time on Oasis and RC.  Loved the ship and found it very easy to get around.  Food was mediocre, even fruit seemed to lack flavor, but it was okay.  Next time we will get a specialty dining package and just factor that cost into the mix when comparing with other options. 

 

Since we were in a suite we had access to Coastal Kitchen which was great. 

 

Need another cruise on Oasis to see some of the parades and other activities we missed, there is so much going on it is hard to cover the ship in one cruise.  Shows were great, loved them all.

 

We loved Central Park, especially at night.  Great place for an evening cocktail or glass of wine.  What a beautiful ship."
4.0	Sail Date: Oct 01, 2016 /	"We sailed on Oasis on Oct 1st, right around Hurricane Matthew! We weren't really affected by it, and I give the Captain full credit for making sure our cruise had a smooth sailing. 

Oasis was BIG. If you've never been, you will be surprised how big it actually is once you get inside. If you have been on RC before, it's very similar to other Freedom class ships but just... more. We sailed on Independence of the Seas (Dec 2015) and the Promenade was very similar. The boardwalk area was really nice, as well as the Central Park area. Good seating choices in Central Park. I liked that the fancier restaurants were there. I highly recommend the 4-course pairing from 150 Central Park. So good. One thing about the food- even in Chops and Giovanni's the food was just ok. The meals we had on the Independence were just a bit better. I couldn't help but wonder if the sheer size of the ship affected the quality everywhere. 

The Solarium was huge as you might expect with a sailing of 6000 ppl, but we always found chairs and could take a dip in the pool for a few minutes. 

Go see the shows.  Make sure you get tickets online ahead of time. And get a specialty dining package! They really are worth it. I would almost recommend a drink package too- something I usually wouldn't do. One pina colada was $14, so if you like 3 or more drinks a day, might as well spring for the pkg. 

We chose the chocolate factory tour at Nassau- Fun, unique. A good thing to have when you've been there on multiple sailings. Loved Smiths Bay in St Thomas. Beautiful, relaxing. Saw 3 weddings on the beach- it's that remote and picturesque. Had fun sweating on the Race in St Maarten. We solved our clues fastest. Ut got caught on the questions at the end- my advice: don't skip a single thing! 

Overall, very good cruise. Just the sheer size of it all felt a little less personal and not as nice. The ship is still gorgeous though, even after seven years! 

Went as a couple and felt sorry for the people with big strollers and kids- getting around the ship is trickier because the neighborhoods are on different levels. Beware the elevators! I never paid attention to Starboard and Port till this cruise!"
5.0	Sail Date: Sep 24, 2016 /	One of the best ships to cruise. Lots of people but never felt crowded. Stay on the Central Park level, so convenient to everything on board. Will go back again!
1.0	Sail Date: Sep 24, 2016 /	Horrible customer service. I felt like this was a new cruise company that had no idea what they were doing.  They messed up our room keys 3 separate times, none of the games in the game room worked correctly, room keys never worked in the picture gallery, etc.  There was absolutely no organization when it came to leaving the ship for excursions.   Again, it was as if they had never run a cruise before.   Just pretty much terrible all the way around.
4.0	Sail Date: Sep 24, 2016 /	"I booked this cruise after a bad day at work and planned it after the busiest part of work, and I will tell you I was ready for it and deserved it. There were some small minor nuisances we encountered. We have cruised RCI only, so we knew what we were getting into and have a level of expectations. 

We flew down the night before which I will highly recommend to anyone! We stayed at the Crowne Plaza hotel which was nice. Free easy shuttle from the hotel and $12 per person will get you a round trip from the hotel to the port and when you get back from the port to the airport. Money well spent for peace of mind and transportation. 

 

I will break down the cruise bit by bit here. Embarkation/check in was a mix bag. The checking in process went smooth and fast. We had a shuttle from our hotel, and it had us at the port around 10:30ish. There was no wait, and they were training someone, but no issues there, however the port workers for intercruises were not the most helpful. They gave no directions on where to go or any next steps.  The seating was a bit disorganized and the workers were not the friendliest (which was apparent in disembarkation). 

 

After about an hour, we were able to get onto the ship. The rooms were not ready, which was anticipated, so the BF and I found on air to have some drinks. It was the least crowded and a nice place to chill until some other not so pleasant cruisers made for an iffy atmosphere so we went to the boardwalk to grab a hot dog and buy some time until the rooms.

 

1pm came and the doors were still closed and no announcements. There were some other cruisers waiting outside our room doors as well. Once that was in a scooter told me to just open the door and go in. I wasn't going to argue, and sure enough no issues and maybe 3 minutes later the announcement that the rooms were ready came on. It seemed for the first couple of days things were always delayed... The rooms for one, We get there and there was no Crown and Anchor letter (which our state room attendant said it would be there tonight), I had on board credit that was not posted until the 2nd day. 

 

Now I will let you know these were all Little things. I still had a fantastic time and our wait staff was amazing! We didn't make one night because we had a late lunch on an excursion and I felt guilty. For breakfast we did room service on days we were in port/had excursions and it was the same old room service breakfast (scrambled eggs, hash browns, bacon/sausage), or I went to the solarium bistro.  We only ate at the Windjamer once for lunch and it was the Windjamer... typical buffet food and set up. I will say the MDR food was great! They redid the menu and it was nice (taste and visual wise). What was fun was I ran across the chef on one of the channels that gave a sneak peak into some dishes. 

 

As far as entertainment, we did CATS, which if you are not familiar with it, I can see how it can be boring or confusing. It was extremely long! We went to a water show one night, but it was canceled because of lightning, which was a common occurrence because the show before us had the same issue.... We never did make it, which is saddening because I hear it is great! The comedy show was mediocure and short (maybe 40 min max).

 

My BF and I were trying to find ""our bar"" and favorite bartender, but could not find it (but we tried!). We are more of a Solarium couple where we like to relax there instead of the main pools. We never had an issue finding a chair, but the pool was small and crowded (well over the posted limit). 

 

I attended a few activities on board. The one time I wanted to do water aerobics, it never happened (but I walked by another morning and they were running it). The sales were overcrowded on the promanade, and not appealing this time around. I did go to an art auction and was tempted with a few pieces, but did not pull the trigger. The auction was a long auction (maybe too long). 

 

Overall it was a great cruise! We had a beach day in Labadee, Did a waterfall climb in Jamaica and Tequila experience in Mexico.  I wish I booked our next cruise on board, but we never got around to it, but will be doing one on my own anyways. 

 

I did buy water shoes for Labadee and the falls specifically. If you go to the Columbus cove, it is not rocky and there is a tram you can take to the end. The falls, you NEED the water shoes. There was a man in flip flops, and he did not last.... 

 

On disembarkation, it was a MESS and the workers were rude. Yes I will be picky here, but I work in a heavily customer service field. There was a HUGE backup. We did express disembark, which was not express. We ended up leaving our room at 8 (which was a delay on our part... I wanted to go earlier), and they had already started with the first couple of groups (ahead of schedule I do believe). The line off the gangway was backed up from the elevators, snaked twice, and to the doors. We were told ""we are waiting for them"" when we asked why we were not allowed to proceed downstairs to customs, and when I asked, ""Who is 'them' "" The woman rolled her eyes and didn't address my question/concerns.... This is not how you handle a crowd of people who are getting agitated and do not have any idea what is going on. Ft. Lauderdale has 2 sides for CBT, and the one side was backed up (The other side I would find was not so backed up, and how or why they wouldn't let the express go there, not sure....). We waited for a good 15-20 min and were finally allowed down the escalators. Overall, it was not organized and I left saying that we will be leaving out of our home port in bmore next time...."
4.0	Sail Date: Sep 24, 2016 /	This is a beautiful ship and so much to do. My only complaint is had to schedule ship activities to ensure you would be able to participate or see the shows.
5.0	Sail Date: Sep 17, 2016 /	Loved this ship. Lots of activities. Food was phenomenal! Lots of choices. Must try the different breakfast options as the buffet does get very crowded. We had a inside balcony overlooking Central Park. Which was wonderful! Highly recommend this beautiful ship.
5.0	Sail Date: Sep 17, 2016 /	This was our first cruise ship. It was such am awesome experience. Everyone was so friendly we definitely got hooked and will continue cruising with Royal Caribbean.
5.0	Sail Date: Sep 10, 2016 /	Our fifth cruise and our fourth with Royal Caribbean. We did it for our 10 Wedding  Anniversary since we had gotten married on a Royal Caribbean Destination Wedding. What an outstanding ship and cruise!
5.0	Sail Date: Sep 03, 2016 /	Outstanding. Probably my favorite ship. Phenominal entertainment, food was really good. Ship didn't seem overcrowded. Central park was great if you wanted quiet. Room was clean, staff was excellent.
5.0	Sail Date: Sep 03, 2016 /	This was my 1st cruise on RC and 5th cruise overall.  I  finally found what I initially expected of a cruiseship. Royal Caribean Oasys of the Seas is the Premiere of a Luxury cruiseship and more. I sponsored my 2 adult children of 24 & 25 at the time of the cruise on Sept./2016 and they were in awe as were my wife and I.  The crew and staff are very attentive and friendly. This trip worth every cent & more and is why we tipped the crew an additional $150 in cash tips.
5.0	Sail Date: Aug 27, 2016 /	Honestly one of the best cruises I've been on and the service was great very friendly staff and you never get bored with the ship there are so many exciting things to do on the ship and it's also very family friendly so very good ship overall
5.0	Sail Date: Aug 13, 2016 /	The ship was awesome!!!!!! Food at buffet could of been better but overall the ship was awesome could not feel it move at all in motion! I was the last person to board stress out of my mind with fear of not getting on to ship the crew was so nice to me and help calm me down!
3.0	Sail Date: Aug 13, 2016 /	Well, all I can say is it's not a Disney Cruise..There's no friendliness of the staff, everyone seems hurried.  The solarium bar tenders seemed agitated and annoyed.  The shows are great if you can get to see any of them.  The Comedy show held 100 people on a ship that carries 6000+ so it was sold out as well as game nite, the marriage game, the karaoke didn't have chairs even though there were 8 empty tables.  You think an employee in charge of On Air would have called for more chairs...tacky!  I was able to see cats on the last day at 2:30 which was fantastic but they sold popcorn at $2.50...really ..how much does popcorn cost especially when they're buying in bulk.  Tacky!   The food was nothing to write home about. Embarkation from ports was disorganized.  The BBQ at Labadee shut down at 1:30  and you had to buy water!  They charge for soda so you had to buy the drink package...again how much does syrup cost...Tacky!  The staff members are not trained to  say good morning or to greet you in anyway with the exception of the houseman Mel.  Our first two nights of dining the waiter was not friendly and didn't ask if we would like coffee...Tacky!  No staff member smiles..not in the shops,  bar, guest services or any other venue.  I shopped in the stores and I might as wel been in Target...swipe your card and sign, no thank you for your purchase Ms Smith or how are you enjoying your cruise.  I'm from NY and thats what it felt like walking around that ship.  I've work for 2 major 4 star properties in Manhattan and you can believe every guest a staff member comes in contact is greeted with some kind of salutation and a smile.  Again it's probably not a bad cruise to some people but if you've every cruised with Disney you will definitely feel and see the difference  and by the way soda is free.  Such a shame too because it's a beautiful ship but what's a pretty face without a personality.
4.0	Sail Date: Aug 06, 2016 /	I will say the cruise ship itself is beautiful. The food is good. I do think that because of its large size the buffet can get extremely crowded. I do appreciate the many pools. Its does lack the many activities that a smaller ship provides. As for my kids they did not enjoy the kids program as much as Carnival's. Actually some of the days they asked to leave early when usually on Carnival they are begging to stay lol. Overall a nice ship with good food but need a little more help on daily activities.
4.0	Sail Date: Jul 30, 2016 /	"Kids had more fun in the kids club than on the Disney Cruise kids clubs. They actually take the kids out of the rooms and around the ship at certain times. My older son (10) had a great time on the Flowrider and the lineups weren't too bad at any given time. The staff was really good at giving tips to people and giving them a few chances.

 

Wait staff Vibin and Rongrong were so friendly and attentive and food in Silk was so good that we cancelled our reservations in the paid restaurants. There just wasn't any need to pay for food when our experience was great in the dining room.

 

If I have any complaints, it's that the refillable drink cups that you have to carry around with you are a pain in the butt.  I never seemed to have mine with me and there aren't enough stations around the ship to refill them. My husband gave up and just drank cocktails instead!

 

Also, the music was so loud in the Windjammer particularly at breakfast that we had to yell at each other to be heard at our table. This was annoying especially after having one too many drinks the night before.

 

Lounge chairs poolside are easy to grab (and we needed 5 in a row), and there's a lot of space on the ship so it never felt crowded.

Checking in was easy but checking out took a lot longer because even though they try to stagger the departure times, everyone seemed to pile off all at once.

 

All in all, it was amazing and we will be back as we never got to do everything that we wanted to."
4.0	Sail Date: Jul 30, 2016 /	"I absolutely loved going on this ship last July-August with my parents and best friend. We had a blast! The only down side was the amount of kids running around and would run into you while walking or run down the halls screaming. We spent a lot of time in the solarium but the ""adult only"" rule was rarely ever enforced. A lot of kids and young teens would be in there and causing a commotion or just being loud. Other than that, the restaurants were great, the food in general was amazing, and every staff member was kind and helpful! Definitely will go on this ship again in the future!"
3.0	Sail Date: Jul 09, 2016 /	Our second cruise with RCL was on The Oasis. I would say this ship is more of an attraction and a destination in itself. As big as The Oasis is, we always felt crowded moving about onboard, but there again The Oasis is more like a small city with a big hotel and less like a cruise ship. Dining options are great but recreation and relaxing are going to be fast paced. You're cramming a lot into a 7 night cruise.
1.0	Sail Date: Jul 09, 2016 /	"I am an avid RCCL cruiser and have been on over 20 cruises with this line alone. I am a 45 year old business owner who has been very loyal to the line for the following reasons:

Better quality food ( The most important reason :)
Great entertainment
Exceptional service
Awesome ships
Great excursions and ports of call 

Due to business I was unable to cruise for the past 2 years. I was told by family and friends that RCCL had really fallen off. They told me there were more pay restaurants than all inclusive ones now and that you were nickeled and dimed to death, and that Carnival was the better choice. I of course being loyal did not believe this so My wife and I along with 11 others booked the Oasis of the Seas cruise that started July 9, 2016 thru July 16, 2016

I will start with the positive! My stateroom attendant was awesome! Unfortunately that is where it stops. These sites are governed by the cruise lines to draw customers so I expect any honest reviews will be removed before most can read but here goes the absolute truth on our cruise with RCCL and the Oasis of the seas. The check in process was smooth and quick. The problems start when you board the ship. You quickly notice the wear and tear on the vessel due to the 6k passengers each week. The carpets are stained the smell from the casino smoke is breathtaking while nothing works including the new Coke stations you just paid $ 65.00 to use for the next 7 days.

I will do my best to provide you with an honest step by step account of my trip in this review. As I state above we walked on the ship expecting the best only to find a ship that looked much older than it's age. I was extremely thirsty so the first thing I did was bought a beverage package. I was given a cheap plastic refill cup and was told there were coke beverage stations all over the ship and I could refill at any one of them. The guy that sold me the package told me this was RCCL's way of allowing the waiters to better serve the alcohol drinkers while making the rest of us service ourselves. I can already see how unimportant I am becoming. Regardless I went to the closest beverage station to find that it did not work. I then went to 5 more to find lines of people upset because the others were non operable as well. That's right we buy a package to serve ourselves and all the stations on the 5th floor didn't work. But the bar was in full bloom. All the alcohol stations worked fine. So I went to the bar closest to me and asked him to fill the drink cup and was told they did not do that in bars anymore to use a station. I explained the stations didn't work and I was told to report the issue. I then found a manager walking by and explained to him my issue he went straight to same bar tender and had him fill my cup along with the 200 others standing behind me. The drink stations only worked in certain areas and even then only worked at times during our 7 day trip. I share this story to set the tone as to what your should expect as I walk you through the rest of my review.

At 1:00 we are allowed to go to staterooms. So we went in and met our attendant. This was the highlight of my cruise. He was a great guy and did a fantastic job. We had dinner reservations at Izumiz Japanese Hibachi restaurant and were waiting on our luggage which never arrived. Nor did anyone else on our side of the 9th floor. The odd thing is there was luggage in halls but none in front of the staterooms it belonged to. So we all started walking the halls on both sides of ship looking for our luggage. We could not find ours and decided to go to dinner and deal with it later. We had prepaid online for the Izumizs package prior to boarding and did not want to be late. We get to the restaurant and are handed our menus. We then find out that what we bought was only for the lower items on the menu and if we wanted premium meats we would have to pay $ 10.00 more. You should expect this price gouging for your entire cruise. After dinner I gave the waiter my sign and sail card for the extra $ 10.00. Now keep in mind I questioned the waiter over the upcharge and clearly told him I thought that was shady since we prepaid. He returns with my card and tells me that my card was declined. I explained to him I booked excursions and bought the coke package all using same sign and sail card that is to be charged to my Amex platinum card. He then in front of all guests says sir you can go to guest services and put money on your card to avoid the embarrassment going forward. As you can see his comment was meant to embarrass but ended badly for him.

I then went to guest services to find a line that had over 120 people in it. That's right I'm not the only one having issues. While standing in line we hear no one can find their luggage, the beverage stations still do not work and the air conditioning in several rooms do not work. The issues are endless and after 1.5 hours on our first night of the cruise we get to the Guest services rep who informs me that there is nothing wrong with my card and the issue is with the restaurant and that she would have her staff locate our luggage. That is right I waste 1.5 hours in line for a working card. We go back to our room to see if luggage is there and still nothing. I then see my neighbor whose luggage was missing as well. We decide to go floor by floor if need be to find our bags and start our search. At 10:30 pm we start noticing the luggage still in the halls belong to rooms all over ship. For example on the 9th floor we found luggage that belonged on the 7th and so on. At 11:15 I locate my neighbors bag on the 8th floor and his wives bag on the opposite side of 9. At 11:30 PM I find our bags together on the back hall of 8. We were in room 9622.

We prepaid for the Atlantis water park excursion that started at 7:15 the next morning that promised 4 hours. We meet at 7:15 am Day 2 and get to Atlantis at 8:15 to be told the water park is closed until 10:00 and that we could use the pools until then. Now keep in mind the ship sails at 1:00 and last shuttle back is 12:30 and park is closed until 10am. This explains itself and when we all complained we were told to go to guest services. LOL. I then cancelled the rest of our excursions immediately.

Now I will quickly hit the highlights of the other issues we had to eliminate a long read.

Entertainment -  reservations were a mess. You would make reservations for shows on your TV and at Guest services and get to shows to find no reservations. This was a common issue for everyone. Their systems were always down and no one could explain why you were lost! There is limited seating for every show and without reservations you can not enter. Some good advice pre book every show prior to boarding if you want any chance to view. Otherwise you will be treated poorly.

Dining - There are now more pay restaurants than all inclusive ones on the larger ships. And even on your main dining menu you can have lower quality selections or pay for better quality dishes. The food used to be the one thing that separated RCCL from Carnival. Now thay are about equal in quality but nickel and dime you to spend more to get better selections. The food on the Oasis is at best average! 

Cleanliness - The grande didning room is located on same floor as the casino. The odor and smoke smell from the casino is so bad many refused to eat in the grande dining room. There are products that kill this odor and smell I hve no idea why this is an issue but it was terrible! The common area restrooms were nasty all the time. The floors were black in the restrooms closest to Opal Theater. People were actually taking pictures of the mess to report. I took a paper towel am wiped an area on the floor. My clean mark was there on Friday night when I went to sleep. My thoughts are way to many people on a ship. Furniture is knicked up, cup holders broken in theaters, carpets filthy, brass tarnished, glass a mess, spa nasty. The overall condition and cleanliness was poor. All surveys will convey this!

Bar Staff - Should be replaced! If you but alcohol they will come to you at poolside but you will pay $ 12.98 per 10 ounce Mudslide specialty drink and get a nice $ 2.00 gratuity added to bill to bring it to you. If you drink non alcoholic drinks forget service and be prepared to buy you a few 2 liters before boarding. The bars will actually refuse to fill our coke cup when your self serve machines do not work. On day 5 I started acting in the same manner as the bar staff. If they walked close Id stand and yell do not avoid non alcohol drinkers we deserve the same damn service as others. And when a guy at the bar refused to fill my cup Id cause a scene. This quickly changed things after a few of these fits!

In closing my thoughts are this. The new ships have to many passengers and not enough staff. RCCL is more concerned with making even more money they forgot what made them different. It is no longer all inclusive therefore no less expensive than flying your family to a destination. If you want decent food and a few beverages expect an additional $ 600.00 to 1k  each added to your sail and sign card. If you have issues they do not care and clearly will do nothing to assist as seen by our luggage. 11 of us went on this ship and unfortunatley all of us had same issues. 12 couples had planned on taking the Allure cruise in April. We all cancelled after this experience and booked Carnival. I am very loyal and really enjoyed my past vacations with RCCL. So I sad to see this occur. Very Sad! I tried explaining my concerns with RCCL Customer support and got same treatment so I refuse to spend my money with such a company! I hope this helps others to avoid the messes we did!

4.0	Sail Date: Jun 25, 2016 /	Huge Ship, and shopping was great, Aquatic show awesome, Flow Rider the bomb however, not a lot of things to do. Wasn't a fan of the safety drill video. Don't get me wrong, I love Royal Caribbean Ships. I just didn't get that personal attentiveness and variety  like on the smaller ships.
5.0	Sail Date: Jun 25, 2016 /	Sailed on Lady O twice and we absolutely love ❤ love ❤ love ❤ this ship 🚢!!! We always stay in a Balcony Cabin with Boardwalk View along with seeing the ocean and Aqua Theater.
5.0	Sail Date: Jun 18, 2016 /	Loved your ship. Want to move to Caribbean when we retire or get a job on Royal Caribbean.
5.0	Sail Date: Jun 18, 2016 /	Went in 2016 with friends that had been in this ship before and had an AWESOME time!!! Husband and myself are hooked for life and planning a family cruise on Harmony Of The Seas in June. Thanks to our friends to have invited us on their journey to a life changing of vacations.
5.0	Sail Date: Jun 18, 2016 /	The ship is beautiful  went with my husband perfect vacation. The ship is so large I could not do everything in 1 week went twice will be going again this year.
5.0	Sail Date: Jun 18, 2016 /	This was my first cruise and I was beyond impressed! All I can say is......EXCELLENCE! This ship is the definition of AMAZING! The food, entertainment, layout, staff, and food (I think I already mentioned food) were all top notch. We enjoyed the clubs as well as the shows. It's something for everyone on this ship. You can't go wrong with a Royal Caribbean Oasis class ship.
5.0	Sail Date: Jun 11, 2016 /	This will be the 3rd time on this awesome ship, and am already signed up for next Oct 2018. The 4th time. For my son's 40th bday. The ship is easy to maneuver.  And is full of activities and the staff. Awesome.  Favorite is dining room at night.
5.0	Sail Date: Jun 04, 2016 /	We loved this ship and I am greatful to have had the oportunity to experience this true marvel at sea. The ship itself is modern and clean. No need for a long winded review, let the photos available online speak for themselves, but know they do not serve this ship justice (You must experience this in person). A major part of enjoying a cruise, is doing your homework before you board. As reasonable people may know, a cruise is what you make of it. With that being said, IT'S A LUXURY CRUISE, how can you not enjoy it? Working a full time job, traffic, cooking your own meals, cleaning your own house, etc is not relaxing nor fun ... Reading some of these unrealistic reviews, full of complaints has prompted me to write this 5 star review, not for the ship or the cruise line (even though they warrant it), but more so for the hard working staff on board that work so hard to make each and every passengers experience special. Me and my wife work very hard all year long. We look forward for that one week where these hard working people make us feel like rock stars. Quite literally. For that we thank them, and Royal Caribbean for ensuring that we have the best time possible during our week of paradise. I highly recommend this ship and this cruise line.
5.0	Sail Date: Jun 04, 2016 /	My first cruise ever was on this ship Oasis. And it was amazing. I can not wait for my next cruise with RC. They really had a lot of entertaining for us to do. It was a birthday cruise and I received a lot of extra perks (specially when our room guy threw my cake away haha). But they were real nice about and even gave us another one. Royal caribbean is awesome. Thank you!!
5.0	Sail Date: May 28, 2016 /	This ship us unbelievable! There is something for everyone. The shows are amazing and the food is exquisite. Make sure to plan your shows in advance so you don't miss them.
1.0	Sail Date: May 28, 2016 /	"I believe this ship is  7 years old. To the RCB 's credit, they have maintained the Oasis superbly. We had a junior suite and the only thing that was completely unacceptable was the condition of their mattress. They had a mattress cover over the mattress and I would wake up in the morning feeling these sink holes and a horrid pain in my back or shoulders from their aged mattress.

I was not the only person in my group who had this opinion. My daughter-in-law who is in superb condition and weighs exactly what she should for her height and frame complained about how the mattress in their cabin was crucifying her back and waking her up several times per night.

 

Cabin Steward for 7648 - This guy was wonderful. He was extremely polite, always had a genuine smile on his face and always had a bucket of ice filled to the brim in the early afternoon and right after dinner. He was so exceptional that on two separate days, I gave him additional money as gratuities for above and beyond quality service.

 

Silk DIning Room - Our waiter was extremely poor at giving impeccable service. He constantly forgot to bring appetizers or a salad or a bowl of soup every evening to someone in our party. He was always the slowest waiter when taking our orders and bringing us the foods. He never caught on and remembered what certain people at our table ordered for beverages each and EVERY night.

The assistant waitress was a gem. She had a beautiful smile and personality to match.

 

The food in the dining room has gotten progressively worse with each cruise that we have taken on the Oasis (third cruise this time). The choices have become more limited and their fish dishes for the most part are horrid. I ordered a filet of sole one evening and took a bite and could not swallow it as it had the taste of old frozen and fishy tasting fish. The chef has become infatuated with serving mashed potatoes with nearly every meal. While the mashed potatoes were not bad, they became extremely boring when they were offered on 5 out of the 7 evening meals. 

It is my opinion that the quality of the dining room food has regressed in taste so that more passengers will make reservations at the specialty restaurants; hence more profit for the company. 

The RCB has raised the price of the fees to dine at their specialty  restaurants and some of their specialty foods that have an added cost in addition to the fees to dine at their specialty restaurant. For instance, two years ago, you could order a 1-1/4 lb lobster for $19.95. This same lobster now costs $29.95. Talk about inflation.

 

Windjammers Restaurant (Buffet) - Talk about some nasty left over mystery meat that has had a sauce added to disguise the taste of two day old leftovers. None of the people in my group cared for this restaurant.

 

Lunch Buffet DIning Room - Again, they have figured out a way to add profitability to their overall bottom line. They had a beef stew that had left over chunks of meat that were doused in a gravy sauce to hide the flavor of two day old meat. Also on the buffet line was a fish fillet that appeared to be Tilapia. This is the cheapest fish available and is farmed in China where there are no guidelines as to the raising and processing of these fish. I wouldn't eat a nibble of these filets as their taste was old, fishy, bitter and scary at best.

Mashed potatoes, AGAIN????

In conclusion, the lunch buffet was better than the Windjammers but after eating there on day two, I refrained from eating there again.

 

Gratuities - This topic has been hashed over and over for several years now and I will keep it to a minimum. I do not like the fact that they automatically bill your credit card daily for the staffs gratuity. Also, I do not like that they make their customers who pay for junior suites and suites a higher charge for gratuity simply because these people are able to afford expensive cabins. The staff does not do additional work for these guests and should not receive more gratuity simply because the guests can afford to pay for a nicer cabin. Also, I do not like that the RCB automatically charges the daily gratuity to your credit card without your consent. I know you can go to the reception desk and request that the gratuities be removed or reduced if you feel the service does not warrant the requested daily charge. Even though I am not in favor of this method, I do understand why they charge for it in this manner. There are too many cheapskates that used to not show up on the last night of the cruise so that they would not have to hand their waiter and busboy an envelope with tip money enclosed. blink and eyelash while stiffing the service staff simply because they do not want to part with their money. The way to resolve the gratuity issue is for the company to pay their staff a higher wage that compensates for the gratuity. This will not happen but there are a few cruise companies that handle the gratuity in this manner. I believe these companies conduct their cruises in European ports.

 

Elevators - While nothing can be done about this issue, it is still worth noting. The Oasis of the Seas actually brags about the number of elevator banks they have on the ship. Whatever that number is, it isn't nearly enough. There are too many times during the day and night that the elevators are so crowded that is you are not claustrophobic, you will be after several rides up and down these elevators. The most amazing part to me is that people really show they true colors when having to deal with the overcrowding. Most people would rather jamb their way into a crowded elevator than wait for the next cab. I have exited these elevators when I felt the overcrowded conditions were not safe. Just imagine if the elevator gets stuck and you are standing shoulder to shoulder breathing everyone's germs while waiting for the ever slow maintenance staff to come rescue you. By the way, they now have flashing lights with the words over crowded when the weight exceeds the recommended weight for their specific elevators. This is new and must have been a requirement after several elevators became stuck from being over weight. I guess the answer is to take the stairs when 80% of the time, the elevators are overcrowded. The disabled are out of luck on this issue.

 

The embarkation on this ship from Fort Lauderdale is better than some of the cruise ports I have been to in the past but the sure fire way to avoid long lines is to wait until the last 45 minutes of the allowable boarding time frame and you will be on the ship in under 10 minutes.

 

The debarkation process is fairly organized considering there are over 5400 passengers trying to get off the ship. If you are able to carry your own bags from your cabin to the baggage claim;customs area, you can leave the ship at 7:30 am. The lines are super long and the distance from Deck 5 to the baggage area in the port is quite a hefty walk.

 

I would switch to another cruise company if they offered newer ships. That is the one area that the RCB has over their competitors. It is my understanding that the Oasis will be moved to Port Canaveral next season to make room for their newest ship Harmony of the Seas."
5.0	Sail Date: May 21, 2016 /	"This was our 12th cruise and 3rd with RCCL. We arrived at Port Everglades at about 1:30pm and were in our cabin by 2:10pm. Wheelchair assist at Pier 18 was simple and flawless. Use Park Cafe on deck 8 when you board for food as Windjammer is a mad scene! Balcony cabin we had on deck 12 was average size yet shower is small. I kept knocking the shampoo dispenser in the shower off. And no, I'm not a big guy!! Cabin steward introduced himself within 5 minutes of us being in the cabin and did a great job of cleaning, doing towel animals (my wife loves those) and keeping us supplied with ice the entire week. Labadee, I had the Dragons Tail Coaster booked but they failed to instruct on where to have the waiver signed so I missed my scheduled time. All the ticket stated was ""Please Sign Waiver"" and I saw no option to sign waiver for this ride on the RCCL website pre-cruise. There were no signs at the ride directing you where to go for the waiver or anyone instructing you where to go prior to the ride. I literally had one foot in the cart for the ride when the worker told me I had to have the waiver signed first. Wondering why they don't have it AT the ride? Guest Services onboard completely agreed especially after I told them the worker at the ride said I would have to go to the back of the line after I had the waiver signed and refunded me the $25 for the ride without hesitation. I stood in line in the heat for 35 minutes the first time and wasn't going to the back of the line for another wait. Also, at Labadee, if you venture beyond Adrenaline Beach to the area where the shops are, be prepared to be hounded by locals selling their junkware. This is the first place I have ever been to where the local merchants won't take ""No Thanks"" as an answer and actually follow you insisting you visit their shop. Falmouth was a good port yet we only went to Margaritaville right at the port for food, drinks and the free WiFi. If you go there, WiFi signal is better outside the restaurant as opposed to inside. Cozumel is our favorite stop. This was our 5th time here. The last 4 we have gone to Paradise Beach. Great family beach and very inexpensive. The crew on the Oasis are great. Always friendly, cleaning the ship and try hard to make your cruise excellent. There are many repeat cruisers on the Oasis I have found. Has to be a reason for that!! Windjammer (buffet) was barely ok. Breakfast consisted of mostly raw bacon, turkey and pork sausage that were overloaded with pepper. It's an ok place to get some food to get your day started. We also did Giovanni's & Chops. Giovanni's was great but make sure to bring some Tums or Previcid to avoid heartburn as the sauce seems to be very acidic. Chops, I was not impressed at all. Ordered the N.Y. Strip steak and although cooked correctly, was tough. Don't see how the ship actually ran out of butter for the last day!! My favorite bar onboard was the Pool bar on deck 15. Service and crew there called me by name after my first visit. The show ""Frozen in time"" was awesome and is a no-miss show as was ""Oasis of Dreams"". Headliners was a fail with some guy that appeared on ""American Idol"" 10 years ago and now works the Vegas strip. We left about 20 minutes into the show. We had assigned seating in the MDR in the Silk dining room and service was great with a beverage attendant ALWAYS with us. After he learned our beverage likes, he had them waiting for us each evening when we arrived. Disembarkation was a bit slow but were told it was due to Customs. Oasis of the Seas is without a doubt the most interesting ship I have sailed so far and plan to return to.  Smoking is permitted on ""most"" open decks on the portside but primarily on deck 15, mid-ship near the Pool bar. Smoking is also allowed in half of the Casino."
5.0	Sail Date: May 14, 2016 /	"I cannot say enough about this ship. WOW!!!

We were blown away with how much there is to see and do. We thought it would feel crowded but the ship is so big that people are spread out making it not feel crowded. 

We were in a Royal Crown Loft Suite which was unbelievable. This is the most amazing room we have ever been in and that includes hotel rooms. 

As a guest in the suites we get to dine in the Coastal Kitchen which was fantastic. The wait staff and host are amazing. My son got sick on the ship and they stopped by our room to check on him and brought soup twice. When they saw him out and about they would constantly ask if he was doing OK. 

The concierge service went way above and beyond for us. We had another guest help us out with our son and we wanted to send something special to their cabin as a thank you. The concierge found their cabin and sent a wonderful pastry package to them. When we asked how much we owed they told us it was on the house because we were doing something special for another passenger. We were shocked and impressed. 

I highly recommend the Chef’s Table pairing dinner. What an amazing experience for the wine lover. You get so much information directly from the chef and your waiter. It is a very small group of people so it feels very personal. It will take up a lot of time but it’s well with it. 

This is definitely a ship you have to take multiple cruises on just to experience all that there is to offer."
5.0	Sail Date: May 14, 2016 /	Oasis was amazing as there is always something to do.  The zip line was fun.  I didn't care for Cats it was just weird.  The other shows were great.   I got a massage and it was relaxing.  It was the best start to a vacation.  Food was good and for the amount of people on the ship it never felt crowded.  Room was great.  All ship personnel I met on the ship were pleasant.  If there weren't so many other RCCL ships to check out I would definitely cruise on Oasis again.
2.0	Sail Date: May 14, 2016 /	"VERY DISAPPOINTED:

This being my first cruise, I was excited, looking forward to relaxing and enjoying our suite. I must say that I was very disappointed. When we arrived at the ship for boarding we had to wait about 20 minutes because they could not find our key cards. They could not find them because they were not even printed out and ready for us.

So, we get to our suite and it is not the room that the travel agent Conradina Knupp at Vacations To Go said it would be. We paid over 5 grand for this suite, we would not have paid that much if she had told us that was the suite we were getting. It room was nice and clean, but not worth spending that amount of money, suite 14330, Oasis Of The Seas very disappointed!!!!!!!!!.

We didn't get to enjoy some of the privileges that came with our suite card until 2 days before the cruise was about to end. We found out that when they printed them they had not even activated the cards and new ones had to be printed out for us. Don't understand why we were charged $19 for the mini bar that we did not use?

I'm not saying the cruise was a total bust, the food selection was good, rooms well cleaned and a lot of things to do."
3.0	Sail Date: May 14, 2016 /	This ship was too big for our taste.  The amount of people they crammed on the ship was felt all over the place. The solarium area was way too small for the amount of people, and we just didn't like this ship. We thought it'd be nice because there was more to do but from now on, we'll stick to the Freedom and similar classes.
5.0	Sail Date: May 07, 2016 /	"We have taken many vacation all over the world, but none were as fun and enjoyable as this one. We actually traveled with another couple, which we had never done before, so we were concerned about that, but Royal Caribbean made it all worth while. There was never a lack of something to do, or if you wanted some alone time, there was never an issue with finding a spot to make that happen.

The excursions were phenomenal !!!!!

Food at 150 Central was out of this world and the service was impeccable.

Overall I would and do highly recommend this cruise to any and everyone."
5.0	Sail Date: May 07, 2016 /	"This review is for the Oasis of the Seas from May 2016.  There were three travelers - mom (me), dad and son (3 1/2 years old).

The ship is huge and amazing! Based on the number of people on the ship, I expected everything to be crowded and to have long lines everywhere... much to my surprise and delight, there were hardly ever any wait times for the things we wanted to do and the only ""crowded"" places were the promenade and pools on days ""at sea""... but even with the crowds you could still navigate around and find seats at one of the pool areas (maybe not your 1st choice seat, but you could find something that worked).

I put a lot of research, planning and budgeting into this trip (both the cruise itself and the various excursion options) and it was all time and money well spent!  I read a lot of reviews and blogs before I booked and used the RC Cruise Planner website frequently to book dining reservations, show reservations and activities (DreamWorks character breakfasts, cupcake decorating class, etc.).

This was one of the best vacations we took as a family and I can even say that this was better than the Disney Dream cruise we took last May (2015).  We did WAY more on this ship in 2 days than we did during our entire Disney cruise!  Granted, the wow factor of the shows/entertainment is better on Disney... but the enjoyability factor is much higher on this ship.  You can actually see things and do things without having tons and tons of crowds of people everywhere you turn!

5.0	Sail Date: Apr 30, 2016 /	We had such a wonderful time in this shop. The crew was wonderful and gracious, the food in the dining room and specialty restaurants was out of this world, and we were always able to find a comfortable spot to relax and enjoy a drink at one of the bars. We loved Oasis!

Anything he could help us with he did. Paying the gratuities is well worth it. I will definitely take another cruise with Royal Caribbean."
5.0	Sail Date: Apr 16, 2016 /	My favorite part of the trip was the ship! So much to do for every age. We were first time cruisers celebrating our 43rd anniversary, and yet there were all ages and nationalities enjoying themselves and we never felt over crowded or out of our element. Such a positive memory making experience. We are doing it every year now.Next cruise on the Oasis in 21 days!!
5.0	Sail Date: Apr 09, 2016 /	I decided last year to go on the Oasis of the Seas instead of going to Vegas. Loved the whole experience. Last time it was a guys trip because we all turned 50. I already booked again and I'm even more excited to take my family. It was very relaxing. The crew was outstanding. The ship is second to none. There are newer ships and even newer Oasis Class ships, but there is only 1 Oasis of the Seas.
5.0	Sail Date: Apr 02, 2016 /	One of our best trips! We loved every minute! Wonderful staff! Room was comfortable and clean. Loved having breakfast delivered to our room. Would definitely do this again!❤️❤️❤️❤️😎😎😎
5.0	Sail Date: Apr 02, 2016 /	My second cruise with RC with my wife, unbelievable time the ship is gorgeous I think that it can be beat only by the Quantum Class, great service, our room valet Kadet was out of this world have of the fun we had onboard belonged to him, lol, we had a great time onboard and inland we are about to go in our yearly cruise in 30 days can wait, and always loyal to RC cruise lines.
5.0	Sail Date: Mar 26, 2016 /	this was a 5 day charter with beach body, it was a lot of fun. Staff seamed nice, I always said hello and told them what a great job they were doing they seemed shocked lol. Food was just ok in windjammer first day they had great food then kinda of went down hill😕. Had a balcony over looking Central Park that was kinda cool but doors are not sound proof as they say. I had just had back surgery my 7th one so walking was difficult, my wife call told them this and the put us in a handicap room which was huge and very clean room number 14651 and Donna our room lady was awesome twice a day clean very friendly. Dining room formal night takes forever 40 min for a drink food was good there.
5.0	Sail Date: Mar 17, 2016 /	The Oasis of the Seas is not like any cruise ship I have ever been on. Imagine walking down a Boardwalk, or Central Park Dining. Walking through the Promenade was like being in a mall with Starbucks, pizza and Cafe. My wife and I were not disappointed and will be sure to use Royal Carribean again.
5.0	Sail Date: Mar 05, 2016 /	Fantastic company, beautiful shio, Royal Caribbean Cruise line with fantastic destination with great captain Per Kristoffersen,  William do this again $ royalwow
5.0	Sail Date: Mar 05, 2016 /	"We had a great time on our third cruise on the Oasis of the Seas. Could not ask for a better cruise ship. I had the drink package and it work out well. The food was OK but the service and staff was great We went to St Maarten, St Thomas and Nassau. We miss the crab shack that was on the boardwalk, they replaced it with a Mexican restaurant which i didn't care much for. We had strong waves and the water was rough. The water show was cancelled and they cut the ice skating show short.

We still had a great time and counting our next trip. The Oasis is coming to port Canaveral in Nov which makes it great for us because we live just 10 min away. No more long drive to Ft Lauderdale."
5.0	Sail Date: Feb 27, 2016 /	This was our first cruise and we have booked another cruise every year since! We LOVED our time on this ship and at sea! The port stops we amazing, my personal favorite was Labadee...it was sooo relaxing!

Service and staff super!

Had a great cruise! The ports were very nice and enjoyed the excursions."
3.0	Sail Date: Feb 27, 2016 /	I will say that we typically cruise on Disney Cruise Line, but my inlaws had cruised on the Oasis and suggested it for our anniversary cruise.  We both enjoyed a lot of what the ship had to offer, but were not impressed with the entertainment at all.  It was way below the standards we are used to in cruising.  Service at dinner was always wonderful, but we missed the customer service you see on DCL.
5.0	Sail Date: Feb 27, 2016 /	The ship was breathtaking, the food was fabulous and the staff were phenomenal!!  We cannot wait to go again! We were first time cruisers and had looked at videos and reviews to find out what to expect for the trip, NONE of those could even begin to touch on the experience itself!  Everyone should experience a cruise at least once in their lives! We were blown away!  We plan to go again and take several family members with us who have never experienced a cruise. There is something to do every day, whether you want to be on the go, or just sit and relax and enjoy the experience! The Oasis of the Seas is a luxurious floating city. Central Park is lovely, especially at night under the stars. We wish we had skipped the excursions and spent more time on the beaches and shopping at the ports, except the explor park in Mexico, that was awesome!
5.0	Sail Date: Feb 20, 2016 /	"I have never been on a cruise before, this was the best vacation ever! I would recommend Royal Caribbean to anyone who asks. There was plenty of entertainment, the staff was wonderful, very polite and attentive. The ports of call, were well guarded and safe. I never had to worry about someone trying to snatch my wallet. The shore excursions were wonderful and fulfilling. The cruise line provided a tour guide as well as rt transportation to the port or downtown shopping after you were done. We got to see the Broadway musical show Cats, as well as several others free of charge. The food was all inclusive and excellent.

We had steak, shrimp and lobster, as well as escargot,  my sister got to zip-line, surf and of course the pools and hot tubs too numerous to count. We are already planning our next cruise."
5.0	Sail Date: Feb 06, 2016 /	Best cruise we have ever been on.  Sailed with my husband, my mother and my 2 boys (9 & 6 at the time).  Ship was large enough that you didn’t feel crowded even with 6000 guests.   Shows were good.  Only issue we had was the ice skating show.  They let too many people in and didn’t have enough seats.  My autistic son had to pee so my husband took him.  People kept trying to take their seat.  He had already been sitting there but because he got up people would sit and we kept telling them he would be right back.  We didn’t really like Oasis of Dreams.  It was a beautiful show but was a little boring for my sons.  Decided to try Harmony because we loved Oasis so much but wasn’t as happy.  Going back on Oasis in February 2018 and bringing the extended family this time.
4.0	Sail Date: Feb 06, 2016 /	Super enjoyable.  Great crew.  Love the ship.  Food was great.  Loved the kids club.  Never felt crowded even at capacity.  Embarkment and Disembarkment were quick and easy.  Rooms were nice.
1.0	Sail Date: Feb 06, 2016 /	"Be careful about being charged for stuff they say is complementary. Because when you question your bill their excuse will be ""that's not what is says on the computer or our systems don't talk to each other or do remember who the person is that told you that"".  Also, be prepared to spend hours waiting for them to produce a receipt that doesn't exist."
5.0	Sail Date: Jan 30, 2016 /	The Oasis of the Seas is an incredible ship.  It is not an adult day care -- the ship offers more to do than anyone can do in only 7 days and there are over 6000 people on board sharing those activities -- you can't just walk on the ship and expect the staff to babysit your vacation.  Our first night on board we set reservations for the whole week and we managed to see very single show they offer (all very well done btw) enjoyed every port of call, and still managed to have time on the deck and in the night spots.
4.0	Sail Date: Jan 09, 2016 /	Great food overall, from the main dining, buffet to the Solarium bistro. What can I say about the onboard activities.  Everyone will definitely find something to do that they like.  We enjoyed the show's!  The shiped didn't feel overcrowded.
3.0	Sail Date: Jan 09, 2016 /	The ship is truly awesome.  There is nothing like it and it never felt like there were 6000 passengers. However, the food was average or less and the breakfast was the worst ever.  I don't know how you can screw up scrambled eggs unless they were powdered.  No made to order omelets in the buffet dining room seemed strange but they had them on the pool deck which did not feel quite right.  I ordered roses for my wife at $75 and what arrived looked nothing like the picture on the web. they tried to satisfy me with a cheap wine bottle and cheap champagne but I had already purchased the drink package so it was a waste. The dining room waiter was good but the overall service on the ship was not great.
5.0	Sail Date: Jan 09, 2016 /	"Had a wonderful time on the Oasis.  The boat was amazing.  I was a bit worried that with that many people it would feel crowed and there would be long lines, however RCCL did a great job of keeping things moving and because the boat is so big, we never felt overcrowded.

 

The first night was rough- we had reservations for My Time dining but still had to wait 40 minutes to be seated, this made us late to the show and they gave away our reservations.  This was the only mishap on the cruise, I would caution you, that if you have my time dining, expect to wait on the first night and make sure you are to your show at least 15 minutes before show time or they will give away our tickets.   

 

The comedy show was hysterical and loved spending time singing along with the entertainer in the Pub.

 

Overall, it was a great cruise and I look forward to my next cruise with RCCL."
3.0	Sail Date: Jan 09, 2016 /	The ship is nice but too big. It lacked a lot of the expected activities that we experienced on other ships, such as food and parties by the pool. The entertainment was just OK and there wasn't  a good variety . The food was above average but the speciality restaurants were expensive and not as good as others that we tried on different ships
4.0	Sail Date: Jan 02, 2016 /	"It was a great cruise with plenty if not too much to do.  Royal always does a great job even though we are noticing plenty of cut backs and drink packages continue to go up.  Unless you are exorbitant drinkers, or have a small group it's not worth it. 

All of the ship events and shows were great!!!  Loved the comedians on board, the headliners and the aqua show.

As for the destinations, the only one we really liked was Cozumel.  We felt safe and had alot of fun.  Labadee is safe and run by the  ships staff, but the beach isn't very nice unless you are in the private Suite beach.  We didn't go on the bay side so can't comment on that.  The did have plenty to do for a fee.  Our family did the zip line, parasailing and jet ski tour and would recommend every one of them."
5.0	Sail Date: Jan 02, 2016 /	I love Oasis from first cruise on this innagural in 2009, one of most wanted by me, because all activities I love starring from flowrider, my favorites,  great service, food, entertainment, port of calls highly recommended everyone!
4.0	Sail Date: Jan 02, 2016 /	beautiful ship, average food, very few late night food choices, jamaica is not worth the stop as people very aggressive scam artists, open pot sales everywhere and bad traffic.  Cozumel was great, labadee was fun although very expensive for activities such as wave runner, parasailing and zip line. Kinda boring cruise, food was just average, staff was great.  Cats was terrible, walked out half way thru it, cruise director was ridiculously energetic and his nightly dance parties were great fun.
2.0	Sail Date: Dec 26, 2015 /	Disappointed that CATS was cancelled all week. We booked because we specifically wanted to see the production.  Fly with Me show, we had seen on another cruise ship so that was disappointing.  The food was not good.  The Buffet had lots of dishes with peppers.  The dining room food was just ok.  They would advertise in the dining room the specialty restaurants so it was obvious if you wanted better food you had to pay extra for it.  It was disappointing that at sea days you couldn't eat in the dining room for breakfast or lunch.  The buffet was the main option.  The buffet also closed at 3 PM which was disappointing to many that had shore excursions.  We came back and only option was to order room service and it wasn't much to pick from and wasn't good at all.
5.0	Sail Date: Dec 12, 2015 /	"You notice it most when you’re in port. Oasis is big. It commands attention. And it dwarfs every other ship.

 

But what does big do for the cruiser?

 

Big means better entertainment. Like its sibling, Allure of the Seas, Oasis of the Seas has top-flight entertainment, starting with the full version of the musical Cats (see tip below). It has a colorful and lively ice show with former championship skaters. An extensive DreamWorks parade. In short, it has shows and events you just won’t see on any other ship. And some productions, like the aqua show with its mesmerizing high divers, you won’t see on land, either.

 

Big means more activities. Only a ship that’s 1,800 feet long (five football fields!) can have a full-sized carousel (rides are free), wave-making machine for surfing and boogie-boarding, 82-foot long zip line, and two rock-climbing walls with multiple levels of difficulty.

 

Big means more places to call your own. Of the three “neighborhoods” (Promenade, Boardwalk and Central Park), Central Park was the most underutilized and thus, became our favorite. Nighttime, you pretty much have the place to yourself. A glass of wine at the Trellis Bar, surrounded by the (real) tropical foliage and sparkling restaurant lights, is a great way to get away from the bustle.

 

Big means more food choices. There are 25 restaurants—some will cost you, but others will not. The complimentary venues begin with three main dining rooms, where the entrees are adequate (thankfully, lobster tails still grace the menu on the second formal night), desserts are good and the rolls are superb (try the pumpkin seed ones). Along with the usual fare, the Windjammer buffet at night has some interesting Asian dishes, such tandoori chicken and curry specialties; brie; and an occasional surprise or two.

 

Among the other free options are Park Café for breakfast and lunch (paninis and salads assembled to order); Sorrento’s, where pizzas can also be made to your taste; and the 24-hour Café Promenade with sandwiches and desserts (try the wonderful cheesecake pops).

 

Big means more space to walk off your meals. The covered jogging track on Deck 5 spans the length of the ship and has one lane dedicated to runners and another to walkers. Be sure to check out the cute sayings overhead. One mile is just 2.4 laps. And aside from the occasional crew member using the track as a short cut, you won’t have much competition for foot space.

 

Ironically, even with its vast size, Oasis still runs out of room. Comedy is relegated to a small theater, forcing the comedians to do show, after show, after show on a seven-day cruise—a fact they never fail to mention. Our Crown and Anchor event was held on the helipad, in the sun, on a hot day.

 

When big is not the best. Big doesn’t necessarily mean better food. While the food on Oasis is okay, it doesn’t get the same emphasis that you’ll see on some other cruise lines. Royal Caribbean focuses on activities and entertainment and for that reason, perhaps, the crowd on Oasis was decidedly younger than on other cruise line ships.

 

And big means more people and longer lines. For the most part, Oasis has crowd control down to a science. Getting back onboard after a port visit always involved some kind of line, but it moved swiftly. Amazingly, disembarkation took significantly less time than it did when we sailed on Celebrity’s Constellation, a ship half of Oasis’ size.

 

Despite the occasional inconveniences and unremarkable food, what you can count on is that Oasis of the Seas is big on fun. -- Musing About Cruising"
4.0	Sail Date: Dec 05, 2015 /	The ship is an incredible thing. Big, smooth, and lots to do. I rarely even felt the wave action. The BOGO drink package made that part affordable and convenient.  The room and dining service was impeccable. Always friendly and timely. The shore excursions were incredible! I did the private island in Haiti, The Falls in Jamaica, and a scuba dive in Cozumel. All worth the time and money. I do have a few negatives. The upcharges for dining seem a tad ridiculous. $6.95 for Johnny Rockets? $3-$10 for the Mexican place on the Boardwalk? Paying for Ice Cream? Seems kind of wrong. I know the ship cost a lot to operate, but the money should come from elsewhere. Some (2-3) of the casino dealers showed their extreme unhappiness with their jobs and employers.  I didn't like some of the jobs I've had in my life, but I never let my superiors or clients know about it. When I ask you how your day is I expect a neutral or positive response not a negative diatribe about how life sucks. Overall, a great adventure. I would probably not go on as big a ship again. Smaller ships seem to have more realistic upcharges and I want to feel the ocean sometimes. Cheers!
5.0	Sail Date: Nov 28, 2015 /	I love the Oasis class ships can’t wait until the next cruise. The entertainment is never ending. The food choices are great so many different restaurants to pick from.
5.0	Sail Date: Nov 28, 2015 /	This was my 2nd time on the Oasis of the sea! We had a great time ! Staff was awesome and very helpful. The shows were awesome, food and drink were very good. The staff was on top of anything you needed
5.0	Sail Date: Nov 28, 2015 /	"We booked our cruise on the Oasis of the Seas for a 7-nights from November 28th to December 5th, 2015 with Online Vacation Center in February 2015.  Since I receive their newsletter regularly, when I got the email way back in February 2015, I convinced my boyfriend to try a cruise for a change.  I must say that he wasn't interested in a cruise at all!  For my part, I had already 4 cruises under my belt, so, normally, it was not a priority for me to do a 5th one...  But, when I read the newsletter, the fact that the ship was THE BIGGEST in the WORLD, all the incentives offered by OVC, and, of course, the cost of the cruise... There was no way I would miss this opportunity.  So, I told all that to my boyfriend and, to my greatest surprise and pleasure, he said YES!!!  I, then, called our couple friends and they also agreed to come with us.  I contacted OVC by phone and talked to Grant, one of their consultants.  He was great in explaining everything and we will definitely book with him again in the future for another cruise.

 

Now, on the review of the pre hotel stay.  First, we decided to go the Fort Lauderdale a day prior to the departure of the ship.  We stayed at Richard's Motel, in Hollywood Florida for one night.  We arrived at Fort Lauderdale at noon and got to the Motel at around 12h45.  Every thing was perfect.  I had made reservations and the room we had was big (2 double beds, a full kichen) and located two steps from the pool.  We enjoyed our stay there and would gladly go back there for a more extended stay.  We left the hotel the next morning at around 11h30.  We got to Port Everglades about 15 minutes later.  Since I had cruised before, I never expected the boarding to be so fast.  Let's not forget that this ship contains almost 5000 people not counting the crew!!!  But, impressively, before 1h00 p.m., we were eating at the Windjammer Buffet and relaxing on the ship!!!

 

We then headed for a tour of our ""home"" !!!!  Oh my God!!! What a ship it is!!!  It is huge and beautiful!!!

 

We had chosen cabins with balcony - view ""Central Park"".  Great choice!!!  On previous cruises, I had stayed in ""inside cabin"", ""oceanview cabin"" and ""suite with veranda oceanview"".  This kind of cabin was new to me so it sounded good and I did not choose wrong.  The cabin itself is large, has lots of storage space and the view was great.  We were on the 12th deck (cabin 12205).  Our room attendant was the best!!!  Since we had our cabins side by side, we asked our attendant to open the glass barrier between us so we could easily access each other's cabin without going in the hallway.

 

Now, the ship itself:  Awesome!!!  Central Park is a beauty beyond words!!!  After seeing our pictures taken in Central Park, our friends and family called us ""liars""!!!! They could not believe we were on a ship.  They argued we were on land somewhere!!! The Boardwalk:  Again, magnificient!!!!  The carrousel, the climbing walls, the restaurants, the decor ... everything is unbelievable!!!  The Promenade with its Casino... just WOW!!!  The Pool area, the Solarium, everything is just GREAT!!!  

 

The food onboard the Oasis of the Seas:  First of all, let's not forget that we were 4 with a different perception for food taste:  Nevertheless, I must say that all 4 of us think the food (the variety, the quantity, the quality, etc.) was EXCELLENT.  From the Windjammer Buffet where we ate mostly all our breakfasts to the Main Dining Room (ours was the American Icon) where we had almost all our dinners to the Wipe Out Café, the Promenade Café and the Solarium Café where we had most of our lunches.  Not once, did any of us complained about the food or the service.  Thanks to OVC, we had vouchers for one dinner in a specialty restaurant.  We chose the Chops Grill and had Filet Mignon along with all the trimmings and, of course, a bottle of red.  THANK YOU SO MUCH OVC, that meal was delicious and we will always remember that special time.

 

With our booking, OVC gave us many incentives including:  pre-paid gratuities, 2 vouchers for a specialty dining experience, $200 onboard credit and a welcome onboard bottle of champagne at arrival.  These incentives, in itself, are practically worth the pricing of the cruise.  After calculation, these incentives have a value of $525,00; the cruise itself was $799,00 - so anyone... do the math!!!!  

 

For us (my boyfriend and I), we finished the cruise with a credit pending of ,59 cents!!!  And, we did NOT deprieved ourselves of anything.  I am a coca-cola addick... so first thing I did when I boarded the ship was get a ""soda package"" for $56,00.  My boyfriend and his friend bought bottles of red wine every night on rotation.  Her wife also bought the soda package after the 3rd day at sea.  Us girls, we treated ourselves to fancy alcool cocktails in the afternoon.

 

The variety and the quality of the shows on the ship is great.  We really enjoyed the tribute to Abba with Abba Cadabra.  They were great !!!!  People complain about the lenght of the Musical '""CATS""... as far as I'm concerned, Abba Cadabra could have lasted 4 hours and I would not have missed one beat!!!!  

 

The skating show ""Frozen In Time"" is fabulous!  The costumes, the decors, the artists, everything is so beautiful !!!  I loved the ""Ugly Duckling"" and the ""Emperor's New Clothes"".

 

Us girls went to the Comedy Show.  The main reason the guys didn't attend is the fact that we are french canadian and the guys are not really bilingual.  And there was no way we were going to translate every joke... loll  So, we went and enjoyed that comedy show greatly.  The 2 comedians are very good.

 

We also attended the show ""Come Fly With Me"", which is mostly an aerial and acrobatical show.  WOW, a plane, a air balloon, etc, on the ship!  The show was spectacular!!!

 

Unfortunately, due to technical problems, we did not get to see the show ""Oasis of Dreams"" at the Aquatheater.

 

We did not attended the Musical ""Cats"".  First, because of our mates' lack of bilingualism and secondly, because of the poor reviews it got (show too long - 2 1/2 hours, not interesting enough for that long, people leaving at the break,etc...)

 

Now, on to the excursions offshore.  First, I must state that we did not book any excursions with the ship.  If there is one thing I can complain about, that would be it:  the extremely high priced excursions offered onboard.  The four of us got off the ship in Nassau and bargained an island tour with the taxi company ""Big Daddy"".  We got a 3 hour tour, visited the Atlantis Hotel & Casino, the Fort, the Ocean, a local market, etc, in private with only the taxi driver for $150,00.  On the ship, a similar tour is over $250,00 for 4 adults.

 

Same thing in St-Thomas except is was more a touring bus.  We were about a dozen and the driver took us all the way to the top of the mountain for great views and pictures to take.  I wanted to go swim at the Magen's Bay Beach but, due to the fact that it had rained every day the week before, that beach was closed but I still got the chance to take pictures of that natural beauty that is part of the 10 most beautiful beaches in the world !!!  That tour was $25,00 each person.  On our way back, our couple friends and myself decided we wanted to be dropped of downtown for a bit of shopping.  My boyfriend went straight back to the ship.  The 3 of us at a wonderful time in Charlotte Amalie, did a lot of shopping and went back to the ship a couple of hours later.  It was $4,00 each for the ride to the ship.

 

Our last stop was St-Martin/Sint-Maarten.  Again, at the pier, we bargained a private taxi and had a great tour of both countries on the island.  We stopped at a view point for pictures and drinks.  Fabulous - even took a picture of a whale!!!  The taxi driver dropped us for a quick stop at the beach near Juliana International Airport just in time for us to watch a boeing arrive and pass just about 20 feet over our heads!!!  That taxi ride was $30,00 each.

 

Let's now take about pre-made reservations:

 

I would greatly suggest that, once your cruise is booked and it is 90 days or so prior to departure, you sign in on Royal Caribbean official website and plan your dinning and shows.  I did all that, and believe me, there is 2 line-ups for these venues... the reservation already made line-up and the non-reservation line-up.  Since I had booked my time-dining, I never got to wait more that a few minutes to be taken to our table for dinner.  I had also booked all the shows I wanted to see:  Never waited in line, got to choose my seating (always in the first rows, etc.).  The people with no reservation would wait until about 10 minutes prior to the show and only the remaining seats would be offered to them.  It is true, the shows are offered many times during the week, but who wants to spend hours and hours waiting in line... I sure don't!!!!

 

Since every good thing must come to an end... the last day arrived.  Our plane back to Montréal from Fort-Lauderdale was only at 9h30 p.m.  We were able to stay on the ship until 11h00 a.m. that final morning.  The disembarkation went has smoothly has did the embarkation a week ago and at noon, we were dropped off by the taxi at the airport.  The waiting part from noon to 9h30 p.m. was long and dull but, we got to pass the time browsing through our thousands of beautiful pictures!!!

 

The epilogue of it all is:  My boyfriend, who did not want to take any cruise is now the person I refer to friends and relatives to ""sell"" the cruising industry!!!

 

Once again, on behalf of my boyfriend and our couple friends, I want to thank Online Vacation Center and specially Grant for the wonderful service !!!"
4.0	Sail Date: Nov 21, 2015 /	This ship was more floating city than cruise ship.  One day we had lunch on the boardwalk and ate hotdogs while riding the carousel with our young nieces.  Another day we went shopping on the mall.  One evening we just sat in central park listening to the crickets and watching the moon while enjoying a glass of wine. On this cruise, the ship is the main attraction, and that's a good thing, because the live entertainment was not very good.  We tried to go to all of the shows but could never make it through more than about 10 minutes.  They were just not good.  Food was good to very good for cruise ship food.  Buffett had a lot of variety, we did not eat there though so cant judge.  Suite lounge was a great oasis on the Oasis.  Service staff very good.  English is not the first language for 75% of crew and that sometimes caused communication problems.  Aqua suite is great for the view and the space.  We put Granma and the teenagers down there.  It is a bit of a hike from one end to the other so keep that in mind if you plan to stay in the Aqua suite and also put your small children in kids camp.  They are at opposite ends of the ship. #momgotaworkout
5.0	Sail Date: Nov 21, 2015 /	This ship is amazing.  It is the only time that I do not get bored being on a 7 day cruise.  There are so many different shows and activities for all ages that everyone can have a blast.  We have a 5 and 7 year old that constantly asked for the kids club.
3.0	Sail Date: Nov 14, 2015 /	"Oasis of the seas, who could not love this vessel?  Well, there were quite a few curmudgeons I ran into that complained it was too large, which baffles me.  If you don't want a large ship, chose another vessel.  If you want a ship that has endless possibilities for entertainment, dining, and fun, this is definitely the class to sail.  The only negative I can say about this vessel's size is I met some fantastic people throughout the cruise that I never saw again, but this can happen even with only 2000 guests on a ship.

 

Entertainment:  By far RCCL's strength.  The non Broadway shows were amazing and I was truly moved by the productions.  Cats was a bore and I slept through it.  The cast was stellar but this show has run its course.  I'm not the only one who feels this way if you read other reviews.  The aqua show had a new cast that was a little rocky, but it was still beyond impressive.  The absolute party on solarium deck was exceptional.

 

Dining:  The mass feeders use lower cost ingredients (GFS garbage) and finding a decent meal can be a bit of a challenge.  However, the specialty dining is well worth the extra money.  Izumi, Sorrento, Chops, Sabor, and the like were all great.  Sabor is an incredible deal and two can share the combo meal easily.  Drinks on board were poured well, albeit slow at times at the bars on the pool deck.  Nearer closing time even if there is a line, some bartenders still clean instead of serving drinks to reduce lines.  Beverage packages are well worth the money.

 

Crowds:  NEVER an issue on Oasis aside from muster and when shows get out, but that is normal.  Getting on and off the ship was effortless and RCCL is to be commended for doing their homework here.

 

Accommodations:  I selected an outside balcony and the room was compact but very well appointed.  She's starting to show her age in some of the drawers as there were spills and wear but nothing horrible.  The shower was amazing, incredible pressure, thank you for no curtains!  Only got one towel animal but that's ok.  Room was quiet and well insulated from noise.  I was in room 10698.

 

Staff:  Most staff were very nice.  This is not a glamorous job and I know that they are not paid well, work long hours, and deal with rude guests and foreign tourists so the lack of morale was noticeable but I completely understand.

 

Internet:  Voom is great!  If using location based apps, because of the nature of the service, your location will not be very accurate at times.  Well worth the expense.

 

Please don't get me wrong, I loved this cruise, it was my first time on RCCL and if for one situation on the ship, I would be a die hard RCCL cruiser (NCL is my previous line of choice).  Their accounting and guest relations/front desk practices and procedures are deplorable.  I used gift cards to pay for my on board expenses (and subsequently cash).  I spent over 4 hours dealing with them and waiting in lines.  I was cut off from room service twice because my account was deactivated.  Missed tours because of this and finally was not let off the boat at the end.  I clearly explained that I was using three $500 gift cards for my expenses and cash for any extras.  I know how gift card authorizations work and spent extra time making sure this wouldn't happen.  They over authorized on all three cards and everything is still a mess nearly a month later.  I ended up paying cash to not have issues the morning of departure including spending 45 minuted the night before making sure my account was settled.  On departure, I was denied departure and had to go in line again, delaying tours and completely ruining my opinion of this line.  Maybe I will overlook this when I book my next cruise, but still very upset about the continued headaches they provided.  I have used gift cards on other lines and have NEVER had a problem.  I would rate the line and the ship experience 10 star had this debacle not happened.

 

One more note, on St. Thomas, I did a 5 hour nature hike, kayak, and snorkel with USVI eco tours.  This was stellar.  Not a ship sanctioned tour, but it was absolutely phenomenal and I HIGHLY recommend it.  I am 36 and did the Orient beach in St. Martin and if you're older you may enjoy it, but please note that younger people do not go here any more.  The median age was probably 55 and it looked like a nursing home with no clothing!  The non nude area was OK, but again, much much older than I expected.  Next time I'll pick another spot!

 

Hope this helps!"
5.0	Sail Date: Oct 31, 2015 /	"We were a little unsure of what to expect on a ship this size. Would it be too much? Overwhelming? Lack personability? Seeing that 4 other ships were boarding from the same port the same day also concerned us. 

 

We arrived at the Port right about 12 noon on Saturday the 31st. We were on board by 12:20pm. We stopped up the grab a bite at the Park cafe and a drink to toast our start of vacation. Room was ready at 1pm with our bags waiting for us. 

 

We had a Central Park Balcony room. The room itself was great. Clean, spacious plenty of closet space-  I will say I could have used a little more drawer or shelf space. Two people seven days with shorts, tanks etc takes up a bit of room. Could have used a few more hangers, but I am sure Duane would have brought us more had we asked, I had packed about 10 from the dry cleaners because I knew we would not have enough. The only note I have about the Central park balcony is it could be very loud. We loved the view and would do a Central Park one in the future- however would make sure the room was on the other half of Central Park Somewhere between Trellis Bar and the Coach shop. 10th, 11th or 12th floor. We were above Chops and the view was wonderful, especially at night. I would pick the lights, trees and stars over an ocean view any day. Not much to see when it is dark looking out at an ocean. The noise came from the pools on the 15th floor, which meant from 7am until 8pm there were lots of kids having fun. Simply walking about 10 rooms down the noise was drastically lessened. 

 

First day, we just kind of got a feel for the ship, Grabbed a few drinks and got ready for Halloween. I was a tad disappointed in the Halloween aspect of the ship. I had really hoped there would be a little more planned for it, the party was ok but that was all there was. After hearing about haunted houses and stuff in the past felt a little cheated. 

 

Nassau was not a favorite of ours, but I won't say I have any complaints. We found a great beach and would definitely spend more time there next time around. Loved picking up a bottle of Tortuga Rum and trying the rum cakes!

 

St Thomas- loved Magic Ice Bar- it was just really cool to see the intricacy of the ice work. Wandered trough downtown a bit then caught a taxi to Emerald Beach. Had some great mahi tacos and Cruzan drinks prices were great, live music playing beach a bit rocky but was a nice little place we would hit up again.

 

St Maarten- by far my favorite stop! My must stop places were Elements jewelry. The pieces are hand made in Bonaire and they are stunning- so bright the literally glow. And just past the ship in the Spice Shop- grabbed some great spices and vanilla, owner was a sweetheart even threw in a few things at no charge because I said my daughter was in culinary school. 

We hit the beach just outside of downtown, rented two chairs and got 4 drinks for under $20. Next time we will venture to the French side of the island. 

 

I will say I was so sick of the high end jewelry shops by the 3rd port that we skipped most of the shopping district. 

 

Theme nights/formal nights- are what you make of them. While some went into the dining room in shorts and t-shirts we enjoyed getting to dress up. Formal nights were both fun for us, but did notice a lot of people opted not to dress up, again it's a personal choice. I love the chance to dress up and have fun. 

 

Dining:

Park Cafe: We ended up here nearly every day for a quick snack, fresh salad or beef sandwich. 

 

Cafe Promenade: Will say it was a step above Carnival food, but was not the best option on the ship and with it being the 24 hour option, would have loved a little higher quality. 

 

Silk/Main dining room: For starters- we never saw any of our table mates, so would have liked a smaller table since it was just the two of us every night. But our waiter, assistant waiter and barman were are great! There were a few items we did not thoroughly enjoy, but it was few and far between. He had duck a few nights prepared differently and each was delicious. Room was never overly loud, the children around us were always well behaved ( great job parents!!!!!) 

 

American Icon: We dined for breakfast a few times and tried lunch on the final sea day. My eggs ben off the menu was great and the other day I stuck with granola and fresh fruit. the only day I would say was ""meh"" was the day that featured chocolate- he ordered the chocolate pancakes, which were just a pancake with a chocolate syrup drizzle. They were just basic nothing exciting. I just had a few bread basket items and asked for a side of bacon, I was given a plate fully loaded with bacon. I expected 2 maybe 4 slices- I seriously had to have had 20 pieces on the plate- just  a huge waste. Lunch the one day we ate down there was ok, we ended up with the buffet because our waiter pushed the buffet, though we said we would most likely order off the menu, he said he'd be back to take our order- we pretty much never saw him again. 


Sorrentos- All I can say is it is drunk late night pizza. not horrible but not very good either

 

Room Service- we tried several things and for the most part was good. The Bee Stung Fried chicken was awful!

 

Giovannis was the only paid restaurant we tried. For $25 per person, we had an antipasta platter that was WONDERFUL, mozzarella wrapped in prosciutto on a kalamata loaf- I could have just had that and nothing else and been VERY VERY happy. Caprese salad was ok, tomatoes a little under-ripe, but it is also November. The prosciutto wrapped chicken breast and lamb were both very good, as were the mashed potatoes and polenta. The mushroom risotto was comparable to any I have had when living in DC, the asparagus cooked perfectly. Desserts were all very good. 

 

Windjammer- we are not rally buffet people, but we did stop in a few times and don't have any complaints, it's buffet food and for buffet food it was not bad. 

 

Solarium- I eat very healthy all year, but I can also be a picky eater- quality was good, just was not able to find anything that really worked for either of us protein wise. 

 

Boardwalk dogs- good selection, decent product. 

 

Johnny Rockets- was my least favorite food the entire time! Had breakfast one day, eggs were over cooked and were the only ones that did not taste fresh. He had the eggs with sausage, never got the toast or hasbrowns that supposedly came with it. I got the omelette. Both our plates were lukewarm and my hashbrowns were very oily. Ended up hitting Park Cafe for muffins(the oatmeal muffin is TERRIFIC!) and bagels. 

 

Bars: 

We had the Premium Package and never found one drink that was not covered cost wise. 

 The selections were great, Bartenders automatically pulled Grey Goose or Patron for any standard drink. They were patient when I wanted something special made. 

Boleros had killers mudslides, the Grand Sangria was one of my favorite drinks of the trip! Music in Boleros could get a bit loud, but it was a fun environment. 

 

Champagne Bar- I loved Talitha! She was just a lot of fun and mixed great drinks. The bar is beautiful and relaxing. 

 

Schooner- while the decor wasn't my fav, the drink menu was probably my favorite of all the bars. They had a great piano player. 

 

Solarium- Paul and Ernesto were both great

 

Trellis- My favorite bar- sitting out in Central Park, was just perfect. 

 

Blaze- we only made it to Blaze once regretfully-  I really liked it, but there were so many other options!

 

Sports Bar- we never really made it in to have a drink

 

Atlas- inventive drinks, fun Pub environment. 

 

Dazzles- this one disappointed me- not because of staff or drinks but rather that we never really got to enjoy it. The place is spectacular, but it was always 80's night or Michael Jackson Tribute night, Disco night, 70's night........Nothing I could have dragged him to- or myself.

 

Entertainment:

Comedy- Club is cute, bar service was lacking- but that tends to be a problem at comedy shows on ships in general. Comedians were good, but not very interactive with the audience.

 

Come Fly with me- I loved loved loved the show! Great show, great choreography, and great aerial work  

 

Oasis of Dreams Water show- our originally scheduled one was cancelled as we had hit some rough seas. They rescheduled for Friday. the show was great, but you could tell the performers were tired. We had watched rehearsal a few times and they were on point. At the show they were out of sync and it almost felt rushed- still amazing show for being on a ship!

 

Frozen in Time- Wow-, the sand art alone was worth the show. But they really did a great job on such a limited size rink. 

 

Love and Marriage show was a lot of fun, but they usually are. 

 

Quest- was a blast! Was annoyed to see parents taking their 12/13 yr old kids in there but that did not deter any of the adults from having a great time! Great job Drew!

 

Prohibition Party- Ok, this is a paid event $35 per person. I am torn on this one - on some aspects they hit this one out of the park. Overall the event was fun. The little extras were a great touch. I think that rather than just bringing out 4 different cocktails without a description doing a drink menu and allowing you to select from that with some knowledge of what you are drinking would be better. I also would have loved a bit more decoration. I have put on a few myself and might just be a bit picky but a little more decor would be great, considering there really is no overhead putting $100 into decorations could take it from a good event to a great event!

 

My only honest complaint was the salon. For the 2nd formal night I had a very 1940's old Hollywood style dress. So I decided to pay the $60 and go have my hair styled to save me the time and frustration of getting a 40's style look myself. Walked in waited 25 minutes after my appointment. Not a big deal. Explained that I was looking for a very 1940's Hollywood glam look. Offered to show photos of what I was looking for. He was determined I was getting curls, I specifically told him Large waves was fine but I did not want anything super curly. For over an hour he worked on my hair keeping me turned from a mirror. Then would stop put something on the eyes or a different facial cream. Then spent 10 minutes talking to me about those products- I felt like I was only there to be sold a product I did not want. Finally he turns me around and my hair has been teased, curled and fluffed - Seriously looked like I was ready for Junior prom in 1985. I walked into our cabin and it was so bad the BF asked is they hadn't had time to get me in...... I walked straight to Guest Services and told her what I had asked for and she apologized and apologized and could not figure out how 1940's turned into what I got.... I was refunded and spent an hour doing my own hair. 

 

For 6,200 people on board we honestly never felt like there was even 1,000 on board even on sea days. The only exception was the Parades which we missed as there were just too many people to even see anything happening. 

 

Will definitely be back for more!!!"

Ft. Lauderdale – Nassau – St. Thomas – St. Maarten

Cabin 11276

 

Introduction

 

This was our 18th cruise and 13th with Royal Caribbean. As I’m writing this, the media is full of reports on the Brazilian man who went overboard at 1:00 a.m. on Friday. I just have to first get this out of my system because of the crazy news reports I’ve seen.

 

“Oscar, Oscar, Oscar Man Overboard Portside”

 

Let me say that my wife and I were sound asleep and didn’t hear the ship-wide announcement, despite being just a five decks above where the incident took place. However we did attend the scheduled Captain’s Corner at 1:00 p.m. held in the Comedy Club on deck 4. Captain Trym Selvag made himself available to answer any and all questions about the cruise, the ship, the crew and running the largest cruise ship in the fleet. This was a long scheduled event, not something to address the tragic man overboard event earlier in the morning.

 

Captain Selvag started the Q&A by directly addressing the man overboard incident. This is not verbatim, but essentially what he told the audience.

 

At just before 1:00 a.m. Friday, a call came in from a neighboring cabin that there was a domestic altercation with a lot of noise. The ship dispatched a security detail to the cabin on deck 7 to deactivate the situation. The Captain told us that one of the parties answered the door and while they were talking, another passenger ran out to the balcony and jumped overboard. The Captain said he didn’t jump out far enough and landed on a lifeboat davit a deck below. By chance, a ship beverage steward saw him and grabbed the man’s bare forearm as he lay on the davit. Another crewman climbed up to also try and pull the man to safety. At this time the Captain said he was asleep and received a call about the potential man overboard situation and he immediately ordered the ship to slow. (The Oasis was presently doing 20 knots.) About 40 seconds later the passenger pulled away from the crewmen holding his arm and fell into the sea.

 

On the ship’s bridge, there is a “man overboard” button that the crew punched to electronically mark the ship’s position. The Oasis, in 40 seconds, had slowed to 12 knots and began a turn to port. On the Oasis, the ‘Oscar, Oscar, Oscar’ call was announced over the P.A system. Also a ‘Pon, Pon, Pon’ call, “person in the water,” was broadcast on a VHF radio channel. The captain said that there were no other ships near enough to help in the search. It was dark, raining heavily and there were six to seven foot seas. Just nasty conditions. The Oasis put two small craft in the water to search for the passenger. The U.S. Coast was called. They dispatched a C-130 out of Clearwater Florida and a helicopter out of Nassau to our position 17 miles east of the Turks and Caicos in the Bahamas chain. With Coast Guard aircraft overhead, the Coast Guard released the Oasis from the search at around 8:30 a.m. or over seven hours after beginning the recovery search.

 

Captain Selvag said, instead of arriving in Ft. Lauderdale at five a.m. on Saturday, we would arrive at seven. The Oasis amped-up its speed for the last day to near the ship’s top speed of 22 knots. My wife and I learned about the situation at breakfast and the captain made a brief announcement to the ship over the P.A. system at around 9:00 a.m. By breakfast, there was a video on YouTube taken by a passenger several decks above, of the man slipping from the grip of the crewmen trying to save him and he dropped into the sea.

 

Sadly, the incident was a suicide not an accident. Initial claims by the man’s partner that his spouse ‘slipped’ off the balcony, can’t be true. I’m 6’1” tall and the balcony railing is up to mid-chest on me. The couple’s cabin also had several broken lamps and a broken coffee table and was the scene of a struggle. They clearly had domestic issues. The Broward County Sherriff’s office conducted the investigation, interviewed witnesses and reviewed the video that was on the news as well as other videos. The man can be heard saying he wanted to jump, ‘let go of me,’  ‘this is all your fault.’ I can imagine the man’s partner was advised to have an attorney when he talked to police as who knew where the investigation might lead? The man’s attorney quickly smelled a buck and charged that his client’s partner was pushed overboard by the Oasis’ crew.

 

The latest entry in the saga has the surviving partner setting up his smartphone in his cabin to video the security team. At this point his partner is over the balcony and he’s freaking out calling everyone murderers and grabbing his phone to alert CNN and the media. Shouldn’t phoning in a man overboard call be somewhere on your ‘to do’ list? This is more than a tragic suicide. There is a smell of extortion, manslaughter, aggravated assault, spousal abuse and a few other potential crimes. We’ll have to wait and see how this plays out.

Now, to the cruise.

 

Getting to the Pier

 

Driving from a friend’s house in Orlando, we had a reservation at Park’N Go. The facility is a mile or two from the pier and also serves the airport. I highly recommend them. We arrived at 11:20 a.m. The staff moved our luggage from our car to their shuttle bus and dropped us off at the pier where baggage handlers took our luggage aboard. The check-in was done in five minutes, very efficient and by noon, we sitting down to lunch in the Windjammer. Park’N Go charged $71.37 for the week, which is cheaper than the on-pier parking deck. Be sure to make a reservation.

 

Departure – Port Everglades

 

This was our first cruise on an Oasis class ship. It takes several days just to absorb all the different neighborhoods that divide the ship into smaller areas with different character. The Promenade on deck 5 is a two person wide jogging track so the muster drill takes place in public areas throughout the ship. Ours was in the AquaTheater at the stern. No life jackets were in your cabin, they are now stored in lockers near your muster station. According to the video shown, you may not necessarily have a seat in a lifeboat in the case of an emergency. The video shows an escape slide that lands you in a large life raft. I just can’t see a forty to fifty foot, near vertical drop into a raft as being good for you on so many levels.

 

My wife and I are Diamond members and at 5:30 we headed to the Diamond Lounge, not far from our cabin on deck 11. The venue was full. It is not large enough to hold the crush of Diamond members that head there at cocktail hour. We headed to the Schooner Bar prior to heading to Giovanni’s for dinner.

 

Tonight was Halloween and all the young children aboard dressed in costume to go Trick or Treating around the ship. A load of grown-ups went full-Halloween as well.

 

We had reservations for the AquaTheater show, however the show was cancelled and rescheduled for us on another day. Apparently there was a technical problem.

 

Bonus, the ESPN Caribbean channel broadcast the World Series game while ESPN 2 Caribbean carried the Notre Dame versus Temple slugfest. After that, the sports channels returned to soccer, rugby and tennis matches.

 

Sunday – Nassau

 

If you had an inside cabin and never went out on deck, you would have no sensation of departing Ft. Lauderdale, sailing and docking in Nassau. The huge Oasis is a very smooth ride.

 

We tried to have breakfast at Johnny Rockets but couldn’t get near the place. Headed up to the Windjammer on deck 16. The Oasis staff was in the elevator lobbies telling everyone the place was full and go to the American Icon Grill dining room on deck 3. This became our preferred breakfast venue as you could order off the menu or do the buffet similar to the Windjammer. It is also where My Time dining is held.

 

At 1:00 p.m., Joanne and I played a round of General Trivia in the Schooner Bar. We won, beating a bar full of teams and learned that at 3:00 there would be the first round of Progressive Trivia. The moderator would accumulate your scores for four sessions during the week. Game on.

 

Nassau was a brief port call and the Oasis departed after lunch for a sea day to St. Thomas. Having learned our lesson on Saturday, we snagged some chairs in the Diamond Lounge at about 4:30.  The bar service didn’t begin until 5:00 but by then the two story lounge was largely occupied. We had a My Time dinner reservation in the American Icon Grill dining room at 6:00. At 7:30, the Captain’s reception was held in the Royal Promenade.  The Perry Philips Jazz Quartet provided the musical entertainment and they are just fantastic. Don’t miss them.

 

The AquaTheater has two large LCD screens and they broadcast the Sunday Night NFL game. They also carried the Monday night football game as well. We headed to Studio B and caught the ice show ‘Frozen in Time.’ Don’t miss it.

 

Monday – Sea Day

 

At 10:45 a.m. the Oasis officers and crew hosted a reception for Crown and Anchor members in the AquaTheater. Adult breakfast beverages were served, ahem, and Captain Selvag welcomed everyone back and thanked them for their brand loyalty and introduced the audience to his team.

 

After dinner, ventriloquist, Ronn Lucas was the Headliner in the Opal Theater. You don’t go to his show because his lips don’t move; you go because he’s funny as hell. He filled the Opal Theater for two shows both Monday and Tuesday nights. See him.

 

Tuesday – St. Thomas

 

The Oasis of the Seas docked at the Crown Bay facility on the East side of Water Island at 10:00 a.m. This was a US Navy submarine base during WWII. We just walked to the end of the pier and browsed the shops. Most of the familiar shop names found in downtown Charlotte Amalie and the Havensight Mall can also be found here.

 

For dinner, we had reservations in the Solarium Bistro forward in the ship. It’s like dining in a glass house with views forward, left, right, the sky above and it was a wonderful venue to watch the night time departure from St. Thomas. The ambiance, service and food were excellent. Give it a try.

 

Wednesday – St. Maarten

 

The Oasis had the port to itself. A bit more casual shopping ashore for us where you loved to hear a steel band playing Christmas tunes on the shop CD player. You could buy the album at the counter. Loved it.

 

Walking back to the ship, we observed a huge barge parked on the port (left) side of the Oasis. It stayed there for several hours pumping fuel aboard. It took two tugs to haul the empty barge away. It was quite large.

 

Thursday - Sea Day

 

The ‘fix’ is in at the Progressive Trivia tournament. Today was the third round and Joanne and I were in third place, just a couple of points from the leading team of six players. Today, each question would have five clues. Answer correctly with the first clue and receive five points. On the second clue, receive four, etc. Here’s the clue that showed us the leading team had been on the cruise and played the game before.

 

Clue No. 1: ‘He was born in California in 1956.’

 

I’m sure you all got, ‘Mel Gibson’ from that. We didn’t. Only the lead team ran up immediately with the correct answer.

 

This was the cruise’s second formal night and the dinner in the main dining rooms featured both lobster and prime rib. Don’t be shy, your waiter will arrange a surf and turf for you.

 

At 7:30 in the Opal Theater, we sat down to watch the show, “Come Fly With Me.” The theater was packed, the show began wonderfully and after about twenty minutes . . . everything stopped. The stage went dark, the music and singing stopped and all the cast members walked off stage as if on cue. One guy was left dangling in mid-air by cables and he was slowly lowered to the stage, detached himself and walked off. A five by twelve foot pit in mid stage was left open. None of us knew what was up. After about five minutes with the theater in the dark, a recorded announcement said there was a technical difficulty and the show would resume shortly.  This announcement repeated every five minutes for a half hour. Very few people left, as the show was that good. After a half-hour, the Cruise Director, Drew Devine, came on stage and said that they were experiencing a massive Windows 7 meltdown and the show was cancelled.

 

I heard a fellow passenger remark that this was the FOURTH show they missed due to computer problems. Apparently the first night AquaTheater performance, a 3-D movie in the Opal Theater, a performance of Cats, and our show, all had computer crashes. The music, singing, lighting, staging, etc. is all computer controlled. When we returned to Ft. Lauderdale, I hope a ship IT person was dispatched to Best Buy for a new server to run the entertainment system. My personal opinion; is stay away from Windows 8 and 10 as well, and recompile the software for a Mac OS.

 

Friday – Sea Day

 

See above, for the man overboard incident that began at 1:00 a.m.

 

Twelve hours later at 1:00 p.m., we attended the ‘Captain’s Corner’ held in the Comedy Club on deck 4. Captain Selvag admitted to not having much sleep. The club was packed. In addition to discussing the man overboard in detail, he answered any and all questions for an hour. I asked him about refueling in St. Maarten. He says the Oasis refuels there every other Wednesday. (In the alternate week, the Oasis sails Western Caribbean ports.) Fuel is the ship’s biggest expense at $100,000 per day, with food, second at $80,000 a day. He works ten weeks on the ship and then gets ten weeks off which is the normal arrangement for captains on all Royal Caribbean ships.

 

The captain was asked if the Oasis would fit through the new Panama Canal when it was completed. He reported that the Canal was wide enough for the ship, however there was a bridge at one end that was too low to fit under.  He said the funnels of the Oasis are designed to retract twenty feet. That is so the ship can squeeze under the Verazano-Narrows Bridge in New York Harbor.

 

At 2:30, we sat down in the Opal Theater to see the performance of Cats. We had never seen it before and my understanding was that it was the fourth longest running show ever on Broadway. I am sorry, but this show bites the big one. It sucks. The cast of 25 or so, may be talented dancers and singers, but the show has no plot and you can’t understand most of the lyrics due to the audio system and the stage is kept very dark so you can’t even appreciate the costumes and makeup. Everyone I saw sit down with their children, left with them in the middle of Act I. I couldn’t relate or get interested in any character in the cast. I was praying that the computer crash that killed an earlier performance would happen again soon. As Act I ended, I leaned over and asked Joanne if she minded if I didn’t return from intermission and she could collect me after the show, drunk out of my mind in the Schooner Bar trying to forget sitting through Act I. She said, “I’m joining you.” I would estimate that about one-half of the 700-seat theater, didn’t return for Act II, based on the crowds at the elevators and staircases leading away from the Opal Theater. Cats is one of the greatest scams in history. At two-and-a-half hours, it is very long for a cruise ship show and, in my opinion; you will regret the loss of those hours for the rest of your life.

 

Friday evening, the seas were picking up, moving the Oasis around in a gentle manner. However you could watch the pool water sloshing back and forth in the AquaTheater. As a result, tonight’s water shows were cancelled for the safety of the performers.

 

Really Cool Things About the Oasis of the Seas

 

There is so much to see and do, you never have to leave the ship. After a week aboard, there are areas of the Oasis we never got to see. It’s the journey, not the destination that matters. We need to book another cruise on her to see more.

 

There are a lot of different dining venues, some at no extra cost, some at an additional cost, to try during your cruise. Do so.

 

The different neighborhoods aboard make this huge ship seem smaller and not crowded.

 

There is great entertainment aboard, with the exception of the show, Cats.

 

Each morning Captain Selvag would star in a short video of some aspect of the ship’s operation. One morning he showed all the radar, GPS and charting systems they use on the bridge for navigation. Another morning, he demonstrated pulling away from a pier using the ship’s Azipod engines and bow thrusters. I found it a neat little show to look for.

 

In Central Park, recordings of birds and crickets are piped in to make the place more authentic. We spotted real birds hitching a ride there when we were far off in the Atlantic.

 

The ship is home to a population of bats. Sitting in the Diamond lounge after sunset one evening the bats could be observed swooping all over the Boardwalk area presumably catching bugs for dinner.

 

The Ship has THREE dedicated shops exclusively selling ladies handbags. They are Kate Spade, Michael Kors and Coach. (What, only three?)

 

Things that the Oasis of the Seas Can Improve

 

The Ship has THREE dedicated shops exclusively selling ladies handbags. They are Kate Spade, Michael Kors and Coach. (Does overkill mean anything to Royal Caribbean?)

 

Before even getting aboard, The Royal Caribbean web site could use a load of work to make it more user friendly. We tried for hours to book our cruise there and finally gave up and called the RCI reservations desk. Given that you are traveling with 6,000 fellow cruisers, you need and want to plan and make reservations for AquaTheater shows, Ice Shows, Headliners, Comedy clubs and any of the specialty restaurants as well as your main dining room preference. The web site does not make this as easy as it should be and you really need to plan your vacation aboard.

 

Elevators – The elevators have no ventilation. You get fresh air when the doors open on a different deck. We’re sailing the tropics, it’s hot and A/C would be welcome. The elevators are the largest I’ve seen on a ship. Packed with passengers, exiting the muster drill, an idiot in the elevator lobby, holding a button down to summon the next car faster, just keeps the door open on the packed elevator in front of him. That doesn’t help anybody. Throughout the cruise, to get on an elevator, we, and many others, took a car down when we wanted to go up, and vice versa. New elevator software would help.

 

The Windjammer Café doesn’t seem large enough for the passenger capacity and it’s inefficient to have to walk around the entire venue to see what’s for lunch at the various stations. The tables there are pretty close together. Also, the ‘salad bar’ was pretty limited to about four vegetables at the most. Smaller class RCI ships had much better salad bars as I recall. This one is an easy fix.

 

You can purchase ‘high speed’ internet access in various packages for your cruise. We received two free days as a perk for being Diamond members. The speed is glacially S L O W. I think the signal is split with 6,000 passenger devices. I wouldn’t pay for it.

 

Just Slightly Creepy

 

Several days into our cruise, we had posed for photographs in several venues. We couldn’t find anything in the FOCUS photo posting area and asked how do we find them. Your cruise card has a photo number and the ship uses your photo taken at the check-in desk to match photos taken of you during the week to that image, and they are placed in a numbered bin for you to review and purchase. All of George Clooney’s photos ended up in my bin for the week.

 

Things You Have to Just Accept as They Are

 

There is no Viking Crown lounge to head to, have a beverage, relax, listen to live music and enjoy a comfortable crow’s nest view of the ship and the ocean you’re sailing on. I miss that.

 

When the Oasis is in port, the ship gets a little warm. Passenger and crew gangways are open along with others for loading supplies. A large amount of the air conditioning being generated, ends up a cool breeze out on the pier.

 

If you go cruising to enjoy the ocean vistas and smells, make sure you book a balcony or ocean view cabin. The specialty restaurants look inward to Central Park or Boardwalk and don’t have windows looking seaside.

 

Saturday – Back to Ft. Lauderdale

 

We glided into port just a bit after sunrise around 7 a.m. The media and Broward County Sheriff’s officials greeted the ship . . . Film at eleven.

 

Summary 

 

We’re sold on the Oasis class. If you haven’t tried it, please do so, I don’t think you will be disappointed. Need a handbag? Climb aboard.

5.0	Sail Date: Oct 21, 2015 /	I loved this ship!!! It was super pretty and everything was wonderful! I loved the bars and the champagne lounge! I could stay there all day! The first night my room flooded overnight but RC handled it quickly and very well! I really had a good time on the Oasis and hope to go back soon!
3.0	Sail Date: Oct 10, 2015 /	"Before we got on the ship, i went on Royal Caribbean web site and went through the pre-boarding procedures. I set it up so that only my wife and I can charge to credit card while on board. My 2 kids cannot charge anything. But that wasn't enough until my 13yr old son racked up 40$ in the arcade room first day on the ship.  My son has no concept of money. We gave him the room card so he can roam around the ship and come back to the room anytime he wants. 

Went and talked to the customer service on the ship . They said my son's account is linked to my account and they refunded the remaining $10 on my son account. Out of $30 so that's fine.  They unlinked my son account and put a note ""do not reactivate"" in the system.

Few days later, saw another $40 arcade on my account. Went to talk to customer service again and they could not explain why my son account is active again.  At first, they refunded some money but I told them that wasn't our fault so they refunded all $40.  I asked them we still have 1.5 day left so how do I prevent this from happening again. They made me fill out the form and set my son spending limit to $0.  They said ""we have no control over the arcade up stair""  which I don't believe. They are taking advantage of kids.

I think by default, kids should not be able to charge anything on the ship. If parents want their kids to spend while on board, they must fill out a form and set the spending limit. 

So if you are cruising with kids and don't want your kids to spend while on board, you need to unlink the kid accounts and/or set the spending limit. The check-in agent at the gate should be able to do this."
4.5	Sail Date: Oct 10, 2015 /	This was the second time I had been on this ship. I did a lot more this time, far as entertainment. The food in the main dining room was not as good as the first time I sailed on this ship.
5.0	Sail Date: Sep 26, 2015 /	My first cruise was in September 2015 with Oasis of the Sea. We had the best experience that made me not wanting to do any other cruise line but Royal Caribbean. Looking forward to the amazing things and service on Harmony.
5.0	Sail Date: Sep 26, 2015 /	Are they still selling the replica boats on board. about 12 in long. I am looking to get another one.  If anyone who just got off please let me know. And if you going to be going soon. i might need you help.
5.0	Sail Date: Sep 19, 2015 /	This cruise was my 50th birthday celebration and what a celebration it was! Eight of us went and will take the experiences of our week on board the Oasis to our graves! The ship is simply spectacular. There are not enough hours in the day to get to experience it all. Our staterooms were roomy and very comfortable - the beds/sheets were great! Our wait staff in the main dining room was phenomenal and went out of their way each night to greatly enhance our meal experience. We bought the premium drink package (something I HIGHLY recommend) and enjoyed wonderful drinks and wines all week as well.
5.0	Sail Date: Sep 19, 2015 /	Being doted on for seven days is a special form of heaven! Really recommend it to anyone. Were there a few things I'd change? Sure. But if you have great company and want to experience something different, give it a shot. Trust that you won't be disappointed!
5.0	Sail Date: Sep 05, 2015 /	Oasis of the Seas was an awesome ship. So much to see and do. The flow of the ship is great and even though it is big and holds about 6000 it never felt overly crowded.
5.0	Sail Date: Sep 05, 2015 /	We sailed in this ship in 2015 & 2016, what an incredible ship. The crew and staff were incredible. The ship both times was immaculate. The entertainment was great.
5.0	Sail Date: Sep 05, 2015 /	20th anniversary celebration very big and beautiful ship would definitely sale again on Waze to the sea but we would go to the Western Caribbean Next

5.0	Sail Date: Aug 22, 2015 /	"It was our first cruise. At the time it was the biggest ship in the world...We had a blast. Couldn't believe how much there was to do on the ship.
Loved it .."
5.0	Sail Date: Aug 22, 2015 /	"HaThe Oasis was the first cruise ship for my wife and I. We were not disappointed. This ship and the crew were delightful. We had a junior suite, but our steward on the 11th deck (Carl) was fantastic and quite knowledgeable.

i can't say enough about the luxury appointments on the ship and the activities schedules for the guests. The ship was amazing and even when traveling between 14 and 18 knots it felt as if we weren't moving at all. Yes, this is my ship for life and when we cruise next year we will be on the 11th deck and hope to get Carl again.

Happy Oasis Couple from Richmond, VA"
2.0	Sail Date: Aug 22, 2015 /	"I was so disappointed with this cruise.  We had been on the Oasis of the seas and the Allure of the seas and the explorer of the seas once before.  We has such high expectation.  Do to the hurricane Danny, it was rerouted which I understand because of the storm, but the islands Costa Maya wasn't good at all.  They had the pool there which was hard to get into and out of, then walking around on the dirt that had all the debris in it.  We tried going to the ocean but was so smelly and dirty we didn't go.  What a waste of time and money. Then Cozumel Mexico the next day which was shopping.. it was ok.

This Western Caribbean cruise was over $300.00 less per person than what we were paid for and were suppose to get, there were 5 people in our party.  That is a lot of money to lose.  These ports probably didn't charge the same fees as the other ports we were suppose to go to.

I always told everyone the best boat is the Oasis, but I didn't have a great experience this time.  The food wasn't as good as it was the last time we were on the ship, from the sit down dining, to the cafe and pizza.  The choices in the cafe were fair at best.  They didn't have the scones, or chocolate chip cookies, and the pizza changed drastically. Even the tea bags were poor, they barely colored the water.    Also, We had many problems with the dining, and where they sat us was awful.  One night they sat us in a dining room off the side of the main dining.   That night, we had reservations for 6:00. When we went to my time dining, they said, no the reservation was for  9:30, which isn't true because the supervisor called himself to book them for us.  So he said he would seat us, so I got all my family including my 80 year old mother in law  and went back to the head waiter, and then he said there was no room at this restaurant and we had to go downstairs to sit.  So we went from Dining on deck 4 then down to deck 3 then back up to deck 4 again with my 80 year old mother in law in tow.  We were seated at 6:05pm and took our order  We weren't served until we complained at 7pm. They brought the covered trays into the room and sat them on top of the water pitchers and there they sat for 20 minutes.  The room they sat us in was where they had dishes stacked, and where they would empty and pile the plates up.  It was terrible to see.  I was shocked by what I saw.

The ship is suppose to be non smoking, but we had to call multiple times for people smoking in their rooms and on the balconies right next to us, and more than once the hallways smelled of smoke too.

Also, we came back from the island with wet towels, and they wouldn't accept them at the gangway, we had to bring them all the ways up to the 15 floor..  ridiculous!  We asked where we could bring the towels, and they said they don't do that, it was our responsibility to bring them up to the 15 floor outside near the 1 towel stand they have for all the pools. but I was able to drop the towels at the gangway the day before.   With being so tired from being out walking, I had to now lug 4 towels up 15 decks.

It was impossible to book shows because they were all sold out by the first day.  This was so aggravating to go standby and ""hope"" you get in.  Many of the shows interfered with dinner, or were at the same times. 

The teens daily compass were hardly displayed, and couldn't get a copy.  I asked if a teen schedule could be printed at the guest service, and they said they couldn't do that.  Ridiculous.

The pools were so crowded, you could just stand in the pool, you couldn't swim.   When I asked at the front desk, he said we have 6000 people on the ship, but this ship was built for 6000 people.  It wasn't a ship that was built for 4000 people that you were trying to squeeze 6000 into.  The solarium had children in the pool the restaurants and hot tubs.   Which is clearly stated in the flyer it is 16 years old plus.  Every we asked the staff, they acted like they didn't know anything about it. 

 

Just disappointed in the overall food on the boat, the quality definitely went down since we were on the last time. So totally disappointed in this $8700.00 plus trip."
5.0	Sail Date: Aug 15, 2015 /	"Oasis of the Seas is truly a magnificent ship, when you think of all the things that have to be done to operate this monster ship and accommodate 6,000 guests, not to mention 3,000 crew members, it's really an amazing accomplishment. The promenade section of the ship is beautiful, and the solarium pool area offers an escape from the busy main pool area of the ship, but I think my favorite part of the ship was ""Central Park"" which is basically an open air  ""Oasis"" that covers most of the middle of the ship, complete with plants, flowers and even a few real birds (not sure if these were castaways, or birds that were introduced to this area) - in any case, this area which also houses a café and three of the ship's specialty restaurants is unique. The only downside of the cruise was a shore excursion in Jamaica (Royal Code - FYB6) which consisted of a long bus ride to Montego Bay and then you were allowed to ""shop"" in Montego Bay for about two hours before you were taken back to the ship. Eventhough the guide for this tour was friendly and informative, this simply was not worth $90.00 for two people. Apart from this bad experience, the ship itself makes this cruise a must!."
5.0	Sail Date: Aug 15, 2015 /	"This ship is awesome for ANY type of group; something for everyone! We had ages 3-73!  

 

First of all, know IN ADVANCE to make reservations online for your entertainment!  It is excellent and you won't want to miss it.  This also helped us decide when & where to eat, as some of our shows were the early showing...

 

know now that the food on RC isn't the absolute best I've had, but it was good--didn't have specialty dining but heard Giovanni's was excellent.  

 

Checking in at the pier was easy, and in spite of the crowd the line moved fast.  Getting off the ship at the end I chose to keep my bags and walk off first thing; EASY, as I had an early flight home.  Taxi was sitting there waiting for me on the curb!

 

the sheer number of pools, lounge areas, etc made the ship never feel crowded; you didn't realize the ship was sold out except the one evening they had a 'parade' like dance party on the promenade and it was like sardines but so much fun!

 

Listen, the ship holds over 5 thousand people!  You might have to wait in a line or two, but GO ON THIS SHIP!  The entertainment was so good!  And in the dance clubs the bands and dj's were awesome!  The pool with the really shallow area that you could just wallow in while sunning was so cool--loved it!

 

Ocean view balcony?  Superb!  Room staff?  Beyond good!  Cleanliness?  10-plus!  Service in restaurants?  Excellent in spite of crowds!  Sommelier in main dining room was really a great addition.

 

ive been on Princess Line (best food), and Celebrity (most number of wheelchairs and walkers I've ever seen; nice ship but BORING) but BY FAR this ship and this cruise line are the BEST,!  JUST DO IT"
1.0	Sail Date: Aug 08, 2015 /	"We picked this ship based on the fact that it's the largest and the best ship Royal Caribbean has,we made a lot of arrangements to go to a specific route:Bahamas,ST.thomas and at.Martin came all the way from Egypt after flying 26 hours just before the cruise day ,by the time we arrived to check in and upon asking for the cruise compass ;we were shocked to find the route changed to Mexico without notifying us by any mean the reason behind this was an upcoming Hurricane .
Well we started our trip ,we faced very poor customer service everywhere which is very strange for Royal Caribbean .
Due to the fact that we dont know much about the new ports the ship will visit (costa Maya and Cozumel)we had to stand in very long lines to the excursion desk to explore what can be done and book through them,the biggest frustration was the excursion team as they were extremely RUDE ,totally unhelpful and have limited information ,after studying all the items they have we booked the best beach they had at Costa Maya ""jungle beach"" as understood from them that they is the best one for family and other excursion for Cozumel .they day we arrived at costa Maya we made sure to be leave the ship on time to catch our booked excursion ,it was written the way out of the ship is level 3,we went to level 3 found a long queue of passengers with nobody from the ship crew to guide us out then everybody went up to 5th floor then they said 3nd floor which was a complete cheos! I have a baby and my parents above 73years old and it took us more than 45minutes to go out of the ship due to the poor management and organization ,we went to jungle beach after an hour drive by a bus from the cruise ship where we found a disgusting beach full of sewage ,insects and very bad smell,after spending 10 minutes we decided that we need to leave ,we went to the bus begging him to drive us back where we found everybody else wants to leave ,we had to stay for more than half an hour until they get the approval from the ship to take is back knowing that it was 3full big buses!!!at the ship we asked to meet the excursion team they said nobody was there until 5pm! Everybody went at 5to meet them they said they have no idea what is this as this is the first time for royal Caribbean at Costa Maya!!! We asked for a refund and a compensation as they spoiled our vacation and the whole day ,they only made refund for the excursion with no compensation what so ever ,it's worth mentioning that we met NCL passengers next day that have changed the route to jamica and Cozumel not costa Maya! And everybody was v happy about jamica ,Cozumel was nice as we cancelled our excursion with the ship,we rented a car and visited everywhere on our own which was far better and cheaper,on our return to the ship we found NCL is just beside our ship at the port and they made a big celebration for their passengers with music ,drinks ,refreshing towels and dance on the port while our ship has nothing at all!!!.the room was extermely small,the food was below average,the waiters at the american icon was very rude and I think they didn't train them how to speak to customers ,never Oasis of the seas as I think they are just selling the name of the ship with no service or passion at all.Moreover the day we arrived to FL we left the ship very early (7am)and after an hour I found that I forgot some items at the cabin closet worth USD1000 ,I called Royal Caribbean and left them an inquiry with all details as per the procedures at their side where I received email after 2days that they couldn't allocate my stuff though they have all the information about my room!"
4.0	Sail Date: Aug 01, 2015 /	This was my first experience on such a large ship.  Unfortunately we were on a group function and didn't get to explore or enjoy all the amenities the ship had to offer.  What I did get to see and do was very good and I look forward to cruising her again.

4.0	Sail Date: Jul 11, 2015 /	"This was my family's first cruise and I guess I expected more from the worlds largest cruise ship. It was almost like they could not accommodate all of the passengers on board. More often than not , a lot of the restaurants ran out of food and were not able to restock. The selection of food was not the greatest for what they boast about. They ran out of towels on the day excursions so we had to go without and it was like "" too bad , so sad"" kind of thing. Other people here have commented on the scam status and I have to agree with that. You are constantly being sold something or pressured into buying more or spending more at their shops and spas. I got ""conned"" into over 400 dollars worth of facial products I really didn't need and it was a complete upsell. The service is for the most part excellent but I felt like a walking wallet to this cruise line. 300 extra dollars for a soda package, 90 extra for the Internet. I don't drink and there were only 3 soda machines on board and then there was a long line to wait on to refill the 300 dollar cup as I call it.  It goes on and on. Then you just feel like a number lost in the mix of thousands of others on board where they are trying to upsell you on buying more stuff. 

The beaches were beautiful but I think I would travel on a smaller cruise line next time. I just felt like a herd of cattle on a ship. And don't get me started on the cramming of people into the elevators that get stuck."
5.0	Sail Date: Jun 20, 2015 /	My 2015 trip on the Oasis left me with PCD: Post Cruise Depression! It’s a beautiful, HUGE ship with a super friendly staff & plenty of things to do! :) 10/10 would definitely recommend
2.0	Sail Date: Jun 06, 2015 /	"MOHAMMED STATEROOM ATTENDANT - EXCELLENT! 

MOHAMMED AT GUEST SERVICES EXCELLENT!  

GIRLS AT STARBUCKS VERY WARM AND FRIENDLY. 

Boat staff in general were warm and helpful, ship was clean and kept incredibly well, kids area fantastic. 

 

Unfortunately however, overall we did not have the greatest experience on this cruise (which was my wife's first cruise however I've been on multiple cruises before, all around the world.) The biggest issue for us has been some situations involving our belongings and the responses we have received.

 

When we arrived, our flight had been delayed (Delta from NYC) and as a result our luggage did not arrive. We were without luggage until Tuesday when we docked in Jamaica.

 

The merchandise available on the ship was incredibly limited, especially considering the size of the ship and the reputation of Royal Caribbean. There was nothing - not a hat, a swimsuit or even a t-shirt for my 11 month old daughter. Mohammed from guest services was kind enough to arrange a complimentary pack of diapers in her size. For myself and my husband the selection was very poor. There was one swimsuit available on the entire ship in my size. I was told that merchandise had not been restocked in a number of weeks. The same went for my husband. We had expected an exciting and luxurious array of summer merchandise to purchase and were totally disappointed. There was not so much as a pair of clean underwear to buy. And for a summer cruise I would have expected at the very least, many swimsuit and cover-up options, as well as dresses for elegant evening etc. We had to wear our clothes from the plane for 3 days. Disappointing.

 

Finally we met our luggage in Jamaica. Our car seat arrived with a crack through the center. Assuming this is the airlines fault but still we are not certain. Furthermore, only two pieces of our luggage actually made it to our room, along with two pieces of another guests luggage!!! 

 

It took a number of hours to actually locate our remaining luggage which had been incorrectly delivered to another guests room. By this stage it wasTuesday night. 

(As a side note Mohammed from guest relations was incredibly helpful and diligent at this time and even called our room to apologize for the mistake. He was on top of our case from the time we boarded and in contact with the airline to make sure our luggage would be delivered.) 

 

Upon debarking the ship in FL we opted for the valet program. We left our 4 pieces of luggage outside our room according to the instructions outlined. We returned to NY on Delta without a hint that their should be any issue. When we arrived however, we discovered that our luggage HAD NEVER BEEN DELIVERED TO THE AIRLINE!!! Of course it took a number of hours to work this out. We had to pay the driver who had arrived to pick us up when the plane landed even though we never took the car because we were delayed for so long looking for our bags. We had an exhausted baby, who needed to get home to eat and sleep. And we were AGAIN looking to locate our luggage. Finally Delta said since the bags had been ""Voided"" there was nothing more they could do. We returned to Manhattan - now stuck in Sunday afternoon traffic which added an hour to our trip with a screaming baby in the car. And no luggage. 

 

Meanwhile I had to call Royal Carribean 3 times. 

 

The first time someone fairly unhelpful said they would ""look into it"" - they didn't give any time frame or expectation as to when we should receive a response. Their reaction was as though we had left a tooth brush on the boat - not the concerned, helpful or apologetic response we would expect for 4 missing pieces of luggage, INCLUDING a baby stroller and ALL our summer clothes, elegant evening wear that we need for a wedding, shoes, toiletries, medicines etc. We received no return phone call. 

 

Called a second time an hour later - The same woman told me ""I don't have any more information, you will have to call back on Monday"". By this stage we were seriously concerned that our luggage was lost or stolen. 

 

Called a third time and spoke to someone different. Got the same standard response. I urged the representative to do more, so he called the warehouse. I insisted to wait on the phone, and after some time he said ""they have found one piece."" Only at my insistence they kept looking and managed to find the other 3 pieces. So we were relieved to have located all 4 items. Unfortunately we were told to call back on MONDAY to arrange for shipping, that we could expect around WED at the earliest. WEDNESDAY?!!! As i mentioned, it is all our summer clothing, toiletries, baby gear and a stroller - how are we supposed to go from Sat - Wed without that?! 

I asked to speak to a supervisor - none available. I finally convinced the man on the phone to allow me to speak to the person in the warehouse. 

 

The woman in the warehouse was slightly more helpful. She explained there was really no way to get the luggage to Delta to be flown out that day (Sat) but that we could request it to be sent via UPS ""next day delivery"" on Monday. So the earliest we can expect to receive our luggage is Tuesday. 

 

We are extremely disappointed and angry. Firstly at the complete incompetence to deliver according to the valet promise. Secondly at the mediocre, unhelpful and unconcerned response we have received. We were offered no reassurance at any point and had we not insisted on more investigation, we still would not be sure as to the whereabouts of our personal belongings. We have also received no explanation as to WHY the pieces never made it to the airport. NOT ACCEPTABLE from a company like Royal Caribbean. 

 

We have had to go out and purchase personal belongings to merely make do for the weekend. So far this has come to approximately $1000 US; This does not even come close to covering what we really need for the next few days. Things like a baby stroller and a hairdryer, cosmetics, clothing etc.

 

We are completely inconvenienced by this, financially put out and not to mention the extreme aggravation and stress that has been endured during what was supposed to be a relaxing week. 

 

Combined with the fact that the ports (in particular Haiti and Jamaica) were BEYOND disappointing (totally inauthentic tourist experience) it was overall not a great experience for my wife's first cruise."
5.0	Sail Date: May 16, 2015 /	"We just returned from our first cruise. We selected the Oasis Eastern Caribbean cruise as a destination celebration for my 50th birthday. The ship is amazing, impressive, massive and fun. We had our concerns as first time cruisers as to whether or not we would like it, would get sea sick etc, etc. We loved it. We had NO issues with sea sickness even with a day or slightly rough seas. Neither my husband nor I took seasickness meds. I did however wear the sea bands for the day the seas were rough. The ship is so massive and impressive that we found ourselves saying several times…..""I can't believe we are on a ship"".   FOOD: We loved the food. Yes, we are foodies and are super critical of food including presentation and taste. We found the food good. With the amount of food they make daily, I was impressed with the quality, variety and taste. There are many options for food….some are complimentary and others require a fee. We explored most dining options (free and fee based). While not fans (in general) of buffets, we loved the Windjammer Cafe (buffet). It was a great place for breakfast and lunch. The menu changed and there was plenty of variety. Dinner we dined mostly in the Main Dinning room as well as 2 specialty restaurants - Giovanni’s and Chops. The main dining room was good. They will make you what ever you want….just ask. We generally ordered extra appetizers and desserts and an entree each. Giovani's was outstanding. I ordered the lamb and it was beyond delicious. Giovanni’s is a specialty restaurant that charged $20 per person. We also dined at Chops- the steak house. Also outstanding. The other dining options, Solarium bistro and Vitality cafe offer healthy ""clean"" food for breakfast and lunch but if you want a basic burger or hotdog…there are options for that too. You will NOT go hungry! As our treat a few days was the soft serve ice cream poolside.   Activities and entertainment:   To say we are exhausted is an understatement. We TRIED to do it all. There is no way to do everything….so don't try. Choose what you like. Advice: book the entertainment shows prior to sailing. We read up on the shows and booked an early dinner (6PM) so that we could make the 8PM or later shows. That strategy worked well for us. We caught all the shows expect for Cats. We decided to skip Cats to do other things in those 2+ hours. Make sure you book the comedy show as the venue is tiny and sells out early. Frozen the ice show is great too.   Other activities were so much fun. Each day you will receive a planner for the next day’s activities in your cabin. We would go through that and jot down the activities we wanted to do. We LOVED the extra shows: Love and Marriage Game show, QUEST game show, Majority Rules and several trivia contests. Like I mentioned before we are exhausted….we ran all over the place having fun!   Zipline, golf, flowrider…..do it. Try them at least once. You will have a blast. And it is not your thing to do…go and watch others. It is so much fun. Spend time pool side when the music/band is playing.   Attitude and behavior……my ONLY complaint is about a few people on board. Some people tend to forget their manners. Often times people got frustrated waiting for elevators. I found some people pushed in or pushed others to get into an elevator. Men remember to hold the door open for others. Be patient…and be kind to others.   Advice on excursions:   St. Marteen. We decided to see the butterfly farm. We loved it. You get a small tour of the island after the tour of the butterfly farm. Afterwards, the tour driver let us out near the beach and we then took a water taxi back.   Nassau: We just walked around the town. We did not select an excursion, as we were not that interested in that port. Since we were there such a short time, the Atlantis excursion felt like a waste of money.   St Thomas: We enjoyed the Land tour that took you around the island. We then spent time in town shopping

Our Cabin:  This was our first cruise, so we were not sure what to expect and trusted the advice of our travel agent and others when selecting the room. Our cabin was on Deck 10 and overlooked Central Park. At first I was concerned that the cabin was in a corner and next to the stairs and elevator. I called and chatted with RCL folks and they assured me it was a good location….and they were correct. The cabin is the last one in the row/area and next to the crew prep area where they keep the linens and supplies. Next to that room is the area for elevators and stairs. We did not encounter ANY noise from the crew room or elevators, stairs or hall. It was a perfect location as we had no neighbor to our right. The cabin was small but nicely appointed. Our cabin was laid out with the bed next to the closet and the couch next to the balcony. They were very creative in providing cubbies and areas to store your things and clothes. I overpacked and I still had plenty of closet and drawer space. We also found the bed to be very comfortable. Note there are not a lot of power outlets. We found one under the bed and there was one on the vanity. We brought with us a power ""block"" that allowed us to plug in multiple devices. There is not a power source in the bathroom. The bathroom was clean. We laughed at the size of the shower. I call it the space tunnel. It is a small capsule. If you are of larger stature, it may feel cramped to you. The small bathroom worked fine for us. Everything about our cabin was perfect. We also enjoyed that our balcony never got blazing hot with full sunlight due to its location. We could sit out on it all day or night. It was awesome….to sit and listen to the live music at night,eat breakfast in the morning and just relax. The window sheers helped give you privacy without having to use the black out shades during the day. Remember to close your balcony door when you are out on the balcony. To save on energy, the AC will not run while the balcony door is open and your room will heat up quickly.

Ft. Lauderdale: We toured around on our own the day before the cruise. We went to the beach and shopped. We did the same when we came back as we had a few hours to kill before our flight home.

Nassau: We just walked around. We were not very impressed with the port and since we were there for such a short time, we did not want to pay to go to Atlantis.

 

St. Marteen--Butterfly Farm

Excellent. Great tour and Danny our driver was hilarious. Also went to the beach on the way back to the ship. We then took a water taxi to the ship. The owner of the farm was very informative. Traffic is terrible on the island…..leave plenty of time to get back to the ship on time.

St Thomas --City Tour

Great way to see the entire island and do some shopping. The busses are open air so it can be a bit warm. They are not well equipped for those with mobility challenges."
5.0	Sail Date: May 02, 2015 /	I like this cruise. The ship is very beautiful with unusual and interesting interior compared to other ships. Very beautiful is Central Garden and Boardwalk, much green plants. Very interesting Aqua Theater, Opal Theater, Casino.  A lot of different cafes, restaurants of delicious food and drinks. The service was  excellent everywhere. Especially THANKS to our Suite Attendant  Mr.  FLORIN MIHAESCU.  He worked excellent and was very attentive.  Our cabin was very clean and cozy.  We feel very comfortable. Thanks for wonderful  cruise.
5.0	Sail Date: May 02, 2015 /	"My 2nd cruise was onboard Oasis. It was a very pleasant experience. 

Stateroom:
The Ocean-View room was very similar to the interior room that we had stayed in on Allure, with a extra bunch of space where the ceiling angles down to the floor. The window is approx 17 sqft, and on an angle, so that you can lay under it, and watch the stars while at sea(Cannot have any lights inside room on when doing this) 

All rooms have a mini-bar/refrigerator, and give you the ability to check your stateroom balance via your TV. Also, there is a decent selection of pay-per-view movies in Kids, Adult, and *ADULT* themes. 

The Main Dining room is Very very close to 5-Star dining. Escargot every night, with food selection that is absolutely fantastic. 

We also ate dinner at 150 Central Park, to celebrate a cruisemate’s birthday. The food and service were outstanding, but I did not feel that it was any better than the Main Diningroom. 

The Pools are...Plentiful. There are 4 main pools, with a hot tub or whirlpool at each pool. There are 2 more hot tubs, at each entrance to the Solarium, which is the 18+ section of the ship. The Solarium contains a 18+ Pool, Cafe/bar, and hot tubs, along with many places to tan, or sit and eat. 

Bars...there are so many bars on this ship, that you could go to a different bar every night, and still not go to all of them. 

The Windjammer buffet seems to be a bit underwhelming. When cooking for 6,000 people, it is very difficult to keep food looking fresh. Both times we were on board,  the food just seemed...meh. 

The onboard track is fairly pleasant for running...if that is the sort of thing you enjoy doing on your vacation, and the Gym is fairly impressive. At least one day of the cruise there is usually Yoga on the Helicopter pad at the front of the ship. 

All-in-all, the Oasis class of ships sets the bar for cruise ships across all brands!"

5.0	Sail Date: Apr 25, 2015 /	The staff on Oasis of the Seas was GREAT!!!  Everything was top notch...We had such a good time, we have already booked a 9 day on the Oasis for next year!!!  Very relaxing, yet very fun filled!!  United Cruises handle everything for us and their staff too was always there to help...they made it easy and hassle free.   The only downside of this vacation was during the excursion...we booked the Royal Dolphin Interaction...it was cold and rainy...the water was very choppy...it should have been cancelled...it was a terrifying experience.  Other than this, the whole trip was wonderful!!!
5.0	Sail Date: Apr 25, 2015 /	We really enjoyed the cruise.  I am retired military, and found everything was very well planned and flowed very smoothly. There were 8,500 people on board and we only waited in line once on the cruise. We stayed in a balcony room, and it was well worth it! The sound of the ocean was very relaxing! I did not realize it was the largest cruise ship when I booked it (or I may not have taken this particular cruise), but there are so many things to do the number of people was not a problem at all. The only thing we didn't enjoy was they were always trying to sell something!  They had good deals, but that isn't what I was there for. Highly recommend!  By the way, the food was great!
5.0	Sail Date: Apr 18, 2015 /	This ship was absolutely amazing, so much to do it’s like a destination in its own, had a blast from the second we stepped on board.  Stateroom was nice and big and the food was amazing as well,
5.0	Sail Date: Apr 18, 2015 /	"This was our fifth seven day cruise in 11 years. Three of them on RC. The ship itself is just amazing and sometimes we found it to be too big but after a few days your learned how to get around.  The longer you are on the ship and having been on several other ships you get to really appreciate the 'Boardwalk"" and 'Central Park"" areas since they are open air. The weather was perfect and the night air was fairly dry for the caribbean and by the last night of the cruise we wished we spent more time in Central Park. As one reviewer mentioned, if you get a balcony facing the Boardwalk or Central park, it does get noisy and there is no privacy while you're on the balcony as there is on the ocean side.

The balcony cabins are about the same as on the ""Navigator of the Seas"" and most other cruise ships. The cabin steward was exceptional. As one reviewer mention that there wasn't any room for their suitcases, they did not realize the they will fit under the bed. We had two very large cases and the at least three suitcases would fit, maybe four. We had a room right off the stairway and elevators and everyone (FWD) had to go by our room. We heard absolutely nothing inside the room. Extremely quite! Most nights we were able to sleep with the balcony door open, My wife's only complaint was there were only two chairs and a table on the balcony (as advertized). She wanted a lounge chair so she could at night sleep on the balcony. It breaks my heart.

The main dining room at the 6:00 PM sitting was crowded and I'm sure the 8:00 PM sitting was probably better. The food was great and the waiters and the Maître d' were very attentive. One night the assistant, being extremely busy forgot our coffee order. The Maître d'  for the remainder of the cruise always came by to be sure everything was in order especially the coffee. One night the diner was a Prime Rib or a Lobster Tail dinner. I was able to order both, we put both on the same plate for a surf and turf dinner. The prime rib was outstanding, nearly able to cut it with a fork. We did not try an of the other specialty restaurants. The Windjammer was nearly huge and you could always find a seat. There are one or two other free food resturants and the one off of Central park was very good.,

Our only disappointment was the shows. I did not know that you now need to make reservations and the first day we frantically made reservation to see most of them during the week. I learned from a travel agent taking this cruise that all of the cruise lines and especially the very large ships are going this way. I think because since there can be up to 6000 passengers that a theater could not be made large enough even though it sat 1500 people.  The Ice show was very good. The comedians are in the very small room that seats only about 75 people and two or three shows a night, We could not get reservations but we got on the stand by line and about 16 people did not show up so we did get the see one show.

There was so much to do that it was not possible to do it all on the ship. A tour of the gardens in Central Park was very nice and to me it was well worth it. You learned more of the mechanics of the garden to keep the 12 thousands plants alive and how the park is integrated to the the ship. 

I have no comments on the ports of call since it can take too long to write. My wife and I go for the ship experience before the importance of the ports. However, we did book a cruise for Feb 2017 Southern Caribbean (9 day) to the ABC islands on RC

5.0	Sail Date: Mar 21, 2015 /	Ten of us returned Saturday, March 28 from a 7 night cruise on Oasis.  We ranged in ages from 9 to 72 and ALL had a great time.  PROS:  The kids loved the flow riders, zip line, rock climbing walls, table tennis, shuffleboard, mini-golf, and sports court.  Our 12 year old girl loved the teen activities, which are open to ages 12-17.  They had a variety of organized and free time activities, so she always wanted to at least check to see what was going on.  The middle aged adults enjoyed the shows, Come Fly With Me and Aqua Show in particular.  We also had fun with the contests and trivia games. I was a judge in the Sexiest Man Contest; my brother was a participant in the Belly Flop Contest, which made it more fun for our family.  The older adult also enjoyed the shows and the food.  There truly is something for everyone.  There is ALWAYS something to do, but there are PLENTY of places to find a quiet nook if that's your desire.  CONS:  The main pool area was crowded at peak times, but if you are willing to sit in the shade or just a little ways from the pool, you could find a nice spot and still have great views and hear the tropical themed music.  There were generally waits for the flow riders, zip line, etc., but it moved pretty quickly.  Getting off the ship was hard.  Apparently, Customs would not allow anyone or any luggage off the ship for quite a while, so the lines REALLY backed up.  I think this could have been handled better if staff had made ship wide announcements letting people know the status of their departure time instead of letting new groups create crazy long lines when earlier groups were still waiting.  It was sort of tense.  We ended up getting off an hour or so later than expected.  OVERALL:  We would definitely go on this ship again.
5.0	Sail Date: Mar 14, 2015 /	"This has been my best cruise experience by far! I never imagined a ship could contain so much! I was gobsmacked the moment I walked aboard. For starters, this ship has so much to do. Just off the top of my head, there of course are pools and hot tubs, a neat solarium for adults... There are also other neat activities like ice skating, ice-skating shows, surfing, aquatic diving shows, rock climbing, even a zip line (small albeit) ALL ON THE SHIP. It doesn't even feel as though you're traveling on water most of the time. I went on the Ft, Lauderdale, Nassau, St. Thomas, St. Martin itinerary which was absolutely lovely. Just beautiful... Straight out of a movie. The food was pretty good also. The last time I traveled RCI, (over 10 years ago), the formal dining experience featured more caribbean flavored food which I really liked. The dining room menus look different now with ""standard"" American fancy fixings. Still good, but I have an adventurous pallet so I preferred the Wind Jammer's food - the buffet style, informal dinning area. Every day they made a variety of food that tasted pretty authentic. The staff were awesome and even the few that were just okay were nice nonetheless. If you're looking for a great getaway thats mostly all inclusive, I would definitely consider this ship! I will say, just like any other cruise, budget for gratuities (not included in your ticket), and excursions as most of the neat places to visit will not be right near the ports and will require bus/taxi/van fare. Great experience !"
4.0	Sail Date: Feb 21, 2015 /	This ship is pretty great!! The only thing I found a little disappointing was the personal drink waiter service on the top deck. I think the ship is so big that they don't have enough wait staff to have them on the upper deck of the ship. I think you get a little better personal service on the smaller ships. Overall, the ship is fantastic and beautiful!!!
3.0	Sail Date: Feb 01, 2015 /	I would prefer better pricing on the spa treatments and the photos
3.0	Sail Date: Feb 01, 2015 /	IT IS A BEUTIFUL SHIP .THE SERVICE IS EXCELLANT. ITS A VERY CLEAN SHIP
3.0	Sail Date: Feb 01, 2015 /	What a fun ship. Great customer service! More events than can be done in a day! Food outstanding.
3.0	Sail Date: Jan 24, 2015 /	We enjoyed everything about the ship. Plenty of activity onboard. Our wait staff was excellent in the dinning room. My only complaint was lukewarm food served every night in the dinning room.
3.0	Sail Date: Jan 24, 2015 /	This was my first cruise so no comparison can be made with other cruises.  I traveled with two sisters as my husband has no desire to vacation on a cruise ship.  We all shared one cabin and it was too crowded to even move.  That was our fault as we should have either gotten a suite or two cabins.  The food and restaurant staff were excellent as was our room attendant.  We booked shore excursions on two of the three ports and they were ok at best.  Getting back on the ship was a hassle.  The ship was too crowded and thus not a relaxing vacation.  I will not do another cruise but instead stick to all inclusive resorts.
5.0	Sail Date: Jan 17, 2015 /	Once you go Oasis class, you never go back.  So much to do and see. Never felt crowded. Food was good considering how many people they feed each day. Staff friendly and accommodating. Spa was gorgeous.
4.5	Sail Date: Jan 03, 2015 /	Overall, amazing second cruise. The larger ships have ruined us for life. We kept feeling as though we were doing as much as possible on everyday and there were still activities we didn't get to participate in.
2.0	Sail Date: Jan 01, 2015 /	It's a beautiful ship
3.0	Sail Date: Jan 01, 2015 /	Loved the ship.  Like a city.  So much beauty!!  Great staff.
3.0	Sail Date: Jan 01, 2015 /	Great ship:  Unorganized when we tried to book venues.  Ship was too crowed.
3.0	Sail Date: Jan 01, 2015 /	Clean\, and always something fun to do!
3.0	Sail Date: Jan 01, 2015 /	The Oasis is the largest cruise ship in the world which allowed for over 6\,000 passengers (did not feel crowded at all).  The layout of the ship allowed for easy access.
3.0	Sail Date: Jan 01, 2015 /	Entertainment was good\, never felt movement from ship\, running track was awesome.  Windjammer was horrible but other restaurants were ok.  The pools are too small and they don't always play music pool side which was disappointing.  Shore excursions were good activities but the companies running them had bad disorganized guides
3.0	Sail Date: Jan 01, 2015 /	Clean and beautiful.  Great ship
3.0	Sail Date: Jan 01, 2015 /	We had a grand suite. It is the only way to go with RC. With a suite you get preferences for all shows.
3.0	Sail Date: Jan 01, 2015 /	Very little to complain about.
3.0	Sail Date: Dec 13, 2014 /	"Largest ship ever.  For me, a little too crowded.  Many kids.  Customer service not really great.  My granddaughter's allergies not addressed until 3rd evening.  Fortunately my granddaughter was always on top of things.  She has a peanut, tree nut allergy and a shellfish allergy. Both are serious allergies. One of our party has an allergy to parmesan cheese (13yr oldgirl) and had a reaction to something she ate while we were celebrating my granddaughters 13th birthday.  She was told by one the nurses to get herself down to the infirmary, which she did, and then was treated.  None of our party knew what had happened to her.  We just knew she had disappeared.  The staff on the ship did all they could to help and was able to locate her and communicate with us.  But, it was a harrowing experience for her parents and the rest of our group.  Just feel that these medical situations could be handled more carefully.  This could really have turned out very badly.  We were very lucky.  But, she was missing  for quite a long period of time.  On the day before departure, the store for small goods, souveniers, etc. was understaffed (0ne man checking everyone out)  He was asked to call for help and replied that everyone was being patient.  That was not my impression.  The line was out the door and all around the store.  People were complaining loudly.  Glass objects were hit and broken on one of the shelves.  I own a boutique in south Florida and would not have handled my store in that way.  The toilets kept breaking and our safe had to be fixed 3 times.  I do not fault the staff.  They were always very kind and did all they could to help us.  But, I believe the ship just had too many passengers onboard.  My son and his new wife had been on this same cruise last year, and did not find it to be this way.  I think the ship is the biggest and most well equipped I've been on.  There was always something to do.  The shows were superbly run, especially the Aqua and Ice shows.  Although, the ice show was standing room only.  I'm almost 72yrs old,and suffered from sciatica for the entire trip.  ...........if that had not happened to me when I got on the ship, I certainly think I would have enjoyed the vacation much more.  The food was at times good but not really great.  However, the specially restaurant (Giovanni's) was exceptional.  Our waiter was extremely wonderful, the food was outstanding, our bottle of wine was incredible, and they even accommodated our entire party for dessert.  I have traveled with Royal before, and may do so again in the future.  My sister in law had never been on a ship and was quite impressed.  She has traveled the world but never by ship.  So, it was really nice to experience it from her view point. I believe your staff did the best they were able to do given the crowds.  Sincerely,  Mrs. Catherine Barnesand

3.0	Sail Date: Dec 01, 2014 /	the nice trips
3.0	Sail Date: Dec 01, 2014 /	The ship was very impressive and clean. The staterooms were nice given the small size(normal for a cruise ship). I thought it was going to be a nightmare to disembark but it took only about an hour. We did the package (extra charge) where the cruise line took your bags and checked them in at the airport for you. We only had to walk through customs with carryons so this expedited the process. Included in this package was the ability to leave the ship at your leisure.
2.0	Sail Date: Nov 29, 2014 /	"In short, I do not recommend this cruise. I have now cruised several times and my recent experience with Oasis of the Seas was amongst the worst of my cruising experiences, which is an extreme disappointment given Royal Caribbean's reputation.

Staff: I will begin by stating the positive; I had the pleasure of meeting several employees upon the ship who were truly great people. However, I met an several unpleasant staff members upon the ship as well. Kristen (I am not sure if that is how you spell her first name) from Chicago (she worked often at Bingo) is the most disrespectful employee I've ever encountered on a cruise ship. In fact, I would go so far as to say that she does not belong working on a cruise ship as her hospitality is far beyond lacking. She had the audacity to speak over one of the members of our five-person group. Kristen provided us the wrong information during disembarking and then had the nerve, in front of dozens of other guests, to condescendingly tell said person of our group (a retired detective, and 22 year veteran of the New York Police Department) to try and do a better job. Then Kristin told our member to get out of her face. It is sad that this is how an employee of Royal Caribbean treated a guest and conducted herself in front of dozens of other guests. This altercation will be remembered as the last moment of the cruise for our five-person group.

Food: Experiencing new foods is one of the most rewarding aspects of cruising for me. Unfortunately, the food on Oasis of the Seas was absolutely terrible. When I go on a cruise ship I want to experience food that is part of the fine dining experience and that I am unable to cook myself. Instead, I found myself in search of ""real food"" when I got on the native islands and craving food from home. The quality of the food, or lack thereof, was underwhelming and a common complaint amongst fellow cruisers. The only great food we enjoyed was at Chops Grille (which had a great server named Julian) which is sad, given that Chops is considered a specialty restaurant and requires and additional fee. It is sad that food of poor quality is provided to people who already paid thousands of dollars for a cruise and great food is only provided if one is willing to pay an additional fee. It goes to show that when one cruises with Royal Caribbean one is merely paying for their presence on the ship itself and must pay much more if one expects to receive the true cruising experience. I should not have to pay additional on a ship for ice cream, a shake, or cappuccino. Nor should I have to wait in line for an extended period of time on a ship. In addition, restaurants were often closed for periods of time making food unexpectedly difficult to find on the ship. I've cruised on other ships where food was made available 24/7. In addition, our five-person group received vouchers for a complimentary dinner at a specialty restaurant of our choice. However, when we attempted to book the dinner we were told that all of the specialty restaurants were booked (we wound up getting in at Chops Grille) and that we could only use our voucher when the ship was at port. I should also note that the staff at Giovanni's had an attitude. 

Casino: Don't bother wasting your money at the casino. The casino pays out terrible and doesn't offer comps. We spent over 4,000 dollars at the casino tables and all we were comped was 3 free drinks). 

Room size: The man who cleaned our room was very nice, and I found that most of the staff in this department was very kind. As for the rooms themselves, the bathrooms are tiny. I myself am a very small person and even I found the size of the bathrooms (especially the shower) to be quite cramped. 

Nickel and Diming: Far too many of the products and services on the cruise ship were nickel and dimed. Sure, soda and alcohol cost an additional charge, as is the cast with all cruise ships - no problem there. But, to pay for a Johnny Rockets milkshake, ice cream, and cappuccino is ridiculous. The arcade even charged guests to play games i.e. $1.50 or so for one game of air hockey. A game of Bingo cost about $37 dollars for the paper game and $67 for the tracker. What is the tracker you ask? It is essentially a handheld digital device that cost more but allows the Bingo player to play 30 games for every one game the old-fashioned Bingo player is playing. And the tracker does all the work for you; you don't have to look for the numbers on the device or mark - it does all the work and tells you if you're a winner or not. The tracker provides an unfair advantage and most of the winners at Bingo were people who used trackers. Trackers are a ploy to make money. What is unfair though is that our group bought multiple trackers at one point. Minutes after we purchased the trackers the Bingo staff announced that they would be selling half-priced trackers (as a means to get more money because Bingo was fairly empty at that hour). In addition, we won a Bingo shirt because of how many Bingo games we played during the cruise. We were told that when worn the shirt would earn us a free Bingo game. However, each time we wore the shirt we received some speech as to how there was a special rule or stipulation that voided the promise. When we finally received the free prize, it was for a section of one Bingo game and not for the full card. 

Lack of Availability/Spirit: Nearly everything on the ship is offered during designated timeframes. Ziplining and rock climbing were only available during two small intervals during the day, times which often conflicted with the shows on the ship. The restaurants (even the free-of-charge buffets) were only open at certain times - unlike other cruises I've been on. The ship lacked any spirit. I've been on cruises where the cruise director constantly made announcements of what was happening on the ship throughout the day. The cruise director on other ships had a fun, vibrant presence that really created the cruising experience. There was no such spirit/presence on this ship. 

Conclusion: Our group of five is extremely disappointed with Royal Caribbean and Oasis of the Seas. It was our first time cruising together in years and it was a poor experience due to the quality of the cruise. I do not recommend this cruise. Find a different cruise line or at least a different ship; your money will be better spent. Bigger is not always better, as is the case with Royal Caribbean's Oasis of the Seas.

Sincerely,

A Disappointed Customer"
5.0	Sail Date: Nov 29, 2014 /	This was a great cruise. We loved the ship. We loved having dinner in the main dining room every night!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Our waitress Shirley and server Sanjeev were awesome!!!!!!!!!!!!! We loved that they knew what we wanted every night and had it there already. They cracked jokes with us. And our kids loved it. The only thing I would say we didn't like is the communication on the ship. We had the Aqua show postponed on us three times and the last time they never told us when it was suppose to take place. So we missed it. The comedy show was OK. I would say the only thing missing is a magician. Overall, it was a great cruise and we can't wait to do it again.
3.0	Sail Date: Nov 01, 2014 /	Excellent ship with lots of variety\, great dining options.  Good entertainment.  Friendly staff.  Clean environment.  Fun trip.
3.0	Sail Date: Nov 01, 2014 /	Oasis of the Seas is a great ship - this was my second voyage.
3.0	Sail Date: Nov 01, 2014 /	Great service by the staff\, very courteous and helpful. Seemed to be geniunely concerned about us and our experience. Food was great! I would like to have more to experience on the islands without having to pay extra. It seems there should be a way to view the islands easier.
3.0	Sail Date: Nov 01, 2014 /	We cruised on the Oasis Sept. 1-12 to Europe we liked it much better before the changes were made. We have NEVER seen so many lines to go eat\, and were very dissatisfied with the changes!!! I hope you don't do the same changes to the Allure when it goes over in April. I thought they could have had more Christmas decorations. We loved the entertainment but should have had more sit down food besides junk food. Windjammer always had a very large line!!! not happy with that at all.
3.0	Sail Date: Nov 01, 2014 /	The ship was very clean\, the staff was very friendly and helpful in every aspect.
3.0	Sail Date: Nov 01, 2014 /	"Pros: shows are amazing\, ship is wonderful
Cons: Main dining room-the food is the same every day"
3.0	Sail Date: Nov 01, 2014 /	Very nice lots to do
3.0	Sail Date: Nov 01, 2014 /	The ship was huge\, but very easy to get around.   Plenty of food\, friendly staff always willing to help
3.0	Sail Date: Nov 01, 2014 /	My first impression was the size of the ship and the next was a feeling of classiness.  The stateroom was beautiful\, especially being able to sit on the balcony.  The food was superb - every night!!!!  The variety of things to do\, places to go\, and things to see made an adventure for me every day.
4.5	Sail Date: Nov 01, 2014 /	Kind of spoiled ourselves by going on the oasis as our first cruise.   It was almost brand new and you cannot compare it to the older ships in the fleet.   Only wish the ports of call would change up a little. Over all it is a ship for family’s and kids.
4.0	Sail Date: Nov 01, 2014 /	Lots to do on the ship.  Can get crowded at ports with so many people on the ship.
5.0	Sail Date: Oct 27, 2014 /	"This was my first time in a ship. The ship is absolutely beautiful. The size of our cabin I would say it was pretty small considering what we paid. I was expecting to have 3 to 4 twin beds, instead we had a queen bed (which was pretty comfortable) and a sofa (that was not that comfortable). Fortunately we spend most of the time out of the cabin since there is so much to do.

There is plenty of food everywhere you go. We had dinner four of our evenings at a restaurant named Silk. Our waiter was Rigor, three of those evening.  Rigor went out of his way to please each one of us. Our party was composed of 6 people, two of them only understand Spanish. Rigor not only spoke Spanish to us he also brought Spanish menus to our table. He also knew the name of each one of us. On our second dinner at the Silk I asked Rigor for a dessert that I had heard about called Baked Alaska. Not only he knew about the desert, it was also on the dessert menu that evening.  I have to admit the Baked Alaska was awesome. On our last night we had a different waiter, his name was Xavier, he was also very nice. Besides Rigor and Xavier there were other waiters that brought us bread and drinks. They were all awesome.

I also enjoyed the shows. Every night except the last day we went to one and some days two shows. The last day we were planning to see Splish Splash (or something like that) but when we went there It was cancelled. Using the TV in your cabin you can book for shows and restaurants, however when we tried we were not able to do any booking through the TV and when we called the telephone numbers we were not able to reserve that way either since the phone was not answered or you had to hold and no one came back. Most of the shows we had no reservation but we showed up and we were able to get in. The Comedy show was pretty good, but they need to use a bigger room instead of the small room.

I visited the Fitness Room daily. They have a large fitness room. You will find all kid of machines. I went in the afternoon and didn't have any issues or had to wait.

 

I particularly enjoyed when we stopped at The Bahamas, but not so much of Cozumel. We had a wonderful tour guide at the Bahamas, his name is Alfred."
2.0	Sail Date: Oct 27, 2014 /	We just got back from a 5 day in junior suite 11360. On the plus side the ship has many things to do. It's like a floating resort.  But there were too many negatives, I assume mostly related to the large size of the boat: - The larger the ship the longer the lines, especially getting on and off.  - Complimentary service and food was generally of poor quality. We found the buffets mostly inedible. The New York style pizza parlor served pizza that reminded us of pizza from the cafeteria in high school. Calls to room service went unanswered. The in-room movies didn't work, etc. To be clear: The for-pay food and service is great.  - The service was impersonal and often rude. Definitely the rudest service I've ever received on a cruise. The Delta airline personal seemed cheerful and accommodating by the time we left that ship. When the staff corrected one the numerous problems they caused us, (toilet overflow, not registering my drink package, forgetting to replenish coffee in the room, etc), there was not even an apologetic tone much less any actual expression of regret. - The ship was so large it didn't feel like being on a boat. That would probably be a big plus for some people who get sea sick but we felt took away from the experience.
4.4	Sail Date: Oct 15, 2014 /	So much to see and do. The entertainment was great.... food wonderful... staff  perfect. However the disembarkation was a nightmare. It left a bad taste in your mouth at the end of a super trip otherwise.
3.0	Sail Date: Oct 15, 2014 /	Having sailed on both the Oasis and Allure several times I was certainly looking forward to spending 12 days at sea on the Oasis.  The first disappointment was the original Concierge Lounge was no more!  That was always such a lovely perk.  Then to find the Diamond Lounges were also gone was astounding.  The Diamond Plus lounge was always a quiet place to sit and have a cup of coffee while enjoying the sea.  But it is gone too!!  The Diamond Lounge overlooking the Promenade was also inaccessible.  That was another lovely place to enjoy the ship.  Lastly, the Viking Lounge had disappeared and become a large, white hospital operating room!!!   I know you're looking toward profits from the added suites, but it has disenfranchised many regular cruisers.  I'm sure this means little to RCCL. It was definitely not inviting.       The new Diamond Lounge looked like a railway car, was always packed and noisy, and had steps which made it difficult to access for people with mobility problems.  I gave up going there for coffee.  It was much easier to just go to Cafe Promenade instead of standing in line while a concierge dished out coffee while having long involved conversations with people as the rest of us waited.     The ship has become very noisy;  there are no quiet spots any longer.  I cruise because of the serenity that can be derived occasionally from finding a nice niche to spend some time.  There are none of those to be had now.  I've never been on a Carnival cruise, but I would suspect the noise level on the Oasis is now similar to the noise you would experience on on of their ships.     As a Diamond Plus member I have long asked for a welcome bottle of white wine upon entering the stateroom.  There was none!  I sent a note with my steward who kept asking if they had sent me the wine.  After four days at sea, I stood in line to talk to the concierge - he assured me that one would be delivered immediately.  I am still waiting!  Considering the number of cruises I've made a cheap bottle of wine should not be too much to ask.       It was also very disappointing to be blocked from booking ones excursions and entertainment on line. I finally phoned the Crown and Anchor to book entertainment - very few were still left.  There were many disappointed travelers who did not even get the same number of shows that I was able to get.       RCCLs booking someone to give lectures is admirable - Celebrity, Holland America, and Princess all have very good lecturers.  It was very disappointing to have the first few days of lectures held in OnAir where very few people could be wedged in to attend these lectures.  I believe the full crowds in the Ice Arena tells the story that these kind of events are very popular.  Royal Caribbean should be encouraged to expand these lectures to more of their cruises.  After all, they own Celebrity and do a good job of lectures on those ships!       The Champagne Lounge was the only spot which was quiet and a bit elegant.  The bartenders, especially Andre from Romania, made that experience very enjoyable.  The only other quiet place to relax was on our stateroom veranda.       The food in the regular restaurant was always very good, and the service was always excellent.  Our waiters in the American Icon restaurant at Table 234, Andre and Crispin, were wonderful!  Our stateroom (stateroom 14206)  steward was exceptionally wonderful.  Those experiences with these wonderful people made the cruise quite worthwhile.     I will not be cruising on the Oasis again. If the Allure is retrofitted to these same standards I will not be cruising with it either.
3.0	Sail Date: Oct 01, 2014 /	Ship was very good and the service was also very good.  Entertainment was very professional
2.0	Sail Date: Oct 01, 2014 /	Older crowd on this cruise.  Many were very grumpy after the disasterous boarding. It was that way through the whole cruise. With it spilling over to the crew. Some crew members were terrible\, in particular\, the wait staff. They need to find work elsewhere.
2.0	Sail Date: Oct 01, 2014 /	A bean counters delight\, maximum profit to RC shareholders\, great inconvenience to passengers.  For passengers a ship of stress. Long lines everywhere; had to book a seat for shows\, which are walk ins on other RC ships; passengers ignored order of getting on and off ship and the crew had zero control.
4.0	Sail Date: Sep 01, 2014 /	We are a retired couple that have cruised with Norwegian and Carnaval about five times to Bermuda, the Carribean and Alaska. This was our best cruise yet. The transAtlantic was smooth as glass. Did not need to worry at all. Enough to keep us busy . Food was excellent in the Dining Room, and did not feel a need to do the special restaurants. Windjammer and Solarium were great for breakfast and lunch. Loved the Make a Wish walking on Deck 5. The spa and gym were excellent. The shows were top rated, amazing and fun. Just a few points. During the muster drill, we sat on the seats near the Aqua Show and got smoky debris from whatever, and got our new khaki shorts dirty with stains that we hard to wash out. We did tell the nearby Oasis staff about the seats being dirty. Next I would say there was a shore excursion to Alhambra. Great visit except we could not understand the tour guide very well due to mechanical issues with the headset clicking, her dialect was not easy to understand, the bus had an issue, and we felt rushed through. I did complain and got a slight 20 percent refund. Otherwise, staff were great, our cabin attendant very helpful, and the dining staff were great and entertaining, too. We liked the number of big hot tubs in the Solarium area. Never used the zip line, the climbing walls, the carousel, the skating rink, or Central Park that much. But not everyone wants to do everything. The casino was a turn off since there was smoke. So we avoided it. Went on the Rising Tide Bar which was fun.  There were nice touches with a parade. A little disappointed in smaller activities like the trivial pursuit games. The small library was good except all the books were taken within the first hour of being on board. After the shows, there were only a few places to have a cup of tea, or a slice of pizza, or a sweet item. Those places were very busy and did not have enough hot water or coffee for the numbers of people who are not drinking alcohol late in the night. Some places seemed empty a lot, then other places seemed very busy - not a lot of flexibility for converting spaces to other purposes - like the big space for the champagne bar, the art auction, and many of the Central Park restaurants that did not seem to be full ever.
5.0	Sail Date: Aug 30, 2014 /	"First and foremost the agent at Cruises only mad it easy and walked me through it step by step.  She got me a GREAT suite withan ocean view balcony for less than an inside cabin rate!

Secondly, I used Park N Go in Ft. Lauderdale and that was perfect.  Car parked, bags loaded ont the shuttle, no problem with security and on the ship 20 minutes after parking the car.

Thirdly,  The Oasis of the Seas is Magnificent!!Food was good, shops and bars were intersesting and the on board entertainment was great.  

Last, the attendants on board were the most polite and helpful people you could hope for.  This being my first cruise and I sailed solo, they sat me at dinner with others of similar age and attude. 

All in all I could not have asked for a better experience.  I met a young lady who was a veteran cruiser who filled me in on shipboard activities and the cruise clubs you can join for alerts regarding future sailings and special pricing.  

Thanks to Cruises Only and Royal Caribbean!!!"
4.0	Sail Date: Aug 30, 2014 /	First time on this ship . It was amazingly big and super clean. Loved the many pools. The jacuzzi overlooking the ocean was awesome. I had a junior suite which was very nice and we really enjoyed our balcony. I was very impressed with the efficacy of the boarding process. My greatest disappointment was with the dining room. Usually the highlight of any cruise is the great food. Our food was barely warm and no better than airline food. Service was fair at best. Generally the beauty of cruises is that they are all inclusive except alcohol, however on this ship even if you ordered a Coke with your dinner,you paid extra. Several of the restaurants and snack foods places, they were extra charge.. Missed the midnight buffet that I have enjoyed on previous cruises. Overall, I enjoyed my cruise on this beautiful ship.
3.0	Sail Date: Aug 30, 2014 /	"We were on a 2 day cruise over Labor Day weekend so I am sure some of the organizational procedures were not in place that would normally be on a 7 day or longer cruise. First of all, the ship is amazing, not just in how huge it is, but also in its' offerings. The Ice and Diving shows were amazing, and the Comedy show was very funny. We enjoyed our stay and our room was very comfortable.

 

Having said all of this, we were disappointed with service and food. It started upon arrival. There was no room for parking at lot 18 so we were directed to lot 19. This in itself was fine, but after we parked we joined a LONG line to wait for two small shuttle buses to take us over to terminal 18. It was very hot in Fort Lauderdale's August sun. Check in was smooth. When we got on the ship, there was no one greeting passengers and directing them where to go. Communication seemed lacking the whole time onboard. When we went and used the pools, we went to one of two towel station open and asked three employees who were standing talking to each other about getting towels, we were directed to another station across the ship. The Windjammer Café was like musical chairs with no music. It was crowed and it was difficult to find seating. Breakfast was ok but anything else was awful. I was given a piece of roast beef that was about 5"" square with a center of about 2"" of fat. I figured maybe the meat would be tender. It wasn't and could not even be cut. Dinner in the dining room was better and the service was good. There was a 70's disco party the first night. I thought, great! Party under the stars on the deck. Nope, wrong! ""Party"" down on deck 5 where all the shops are. Not a party. Music while we encourage you to spend money. Very disappointing.

 

We enjoyed our quick getaway, but will probably avoid these massive ships. Not for us, especially because midsize ships offer better service and value for money. This was our 12th cruise  so we do have things to compare it to."

Food was okay, but dessert were n.ot so good, overall very nice cruise!"
5.0	Sail Date: Aug 30, 2014 /	This was only a 2 night to the Bahamas but we were going to enjoy every minute of it. I have given a couple of reviews on this class and can't stop referring them. Only complaint, too short but we knew we didn't want to leave after the second night.
4.4	Sail Date: Aug 23, 2014 /	This is a hugh beautiful ship, lots of different activities, the casino was nice and the night clubs were fun. Plenty of different resturants to choose from.
2.0	Sail Date: Aug 16, 2014 /	"No matter how beautiful or modern a ship may be, which the Oasis of the Seas is, if the food experience is poor the trip is ruined.  As a frequent cruiser, I would prefer an older ship with outstanding food.  It was evident that a decision was made recently by corporate to cut costs.  Based on past reviews, my wife and I looked forward to an excellent experience.  The ship was impressive.  The first night in the main dining room set the tone for the week.  Food came out cool, not hot.  Quality was what you would expect from a cafeteria, not the flagship of the fleet!  Soups and sauces were ""broken"", flavorless and packaged.  Fish dishes frozen, and tasted ""fishy"" and not fresh.  Beef dishes had a strange texture and taste.  Reminded me of my first taste of beef in a third world country. Desserts all had the same problem;  hard textures, lack of richness and also not fresh.  The next day looked forward to a good breakfast only to find no omelet station, trays of food piled high of flavorless scrambled eggs, and everything again lukewarm!  We gave the dining room one more attempt that night only to find more of the same.  We felt forced to eat the remainder of the nights in the specialty restaurants.  Wonder if this is an intentional corporate decision to drive those with high expectations of food to have to pay $$ ?  Specialty restaurants made the trip bearable with decent to good food.  Our last cruise on Celebrity was an outstanding food experience.  I regret not choosing it again!"
1.0	Sail Date: Aug 02, 2014 /	I went on this cruise expecting it to be amazing and beautiful. The amazement however came in the negative direction. The first day we arrived the buffet closed at 9 pm, so once we reached there at 9:30 it was closed. I have never seen this before in my 10 cruising experience, usually buffets close at 11pm-1 am. We then tried going to the Opus dinning room and it was too late. WE DID NOT EAT because we wanted dinner at 9:30pm. Not only that but the buffet staff was extremely unwelcoming and gave you bizarre stares, or scolded you when you kindly asked for something. The best part of the buffet i have to say was the redundant recording that was on repeat in the background while you ate. It basically said hurry up and eat so others can sit down, chug your food down. Another thing that really ticked me off was the 30-40 minute line you had to make every time you wanted to go to the buffet as the Royal Caribbean cheapos made more staterooms instead of a larger buffet. To top it all off the food honeslty was horrid. There was no flavor, and a very limited quantity, i had to scourge for 20 minutes trying to find something decent only to have salad and coldcuts because everything else was not appeasing. The deserts were actually phenomenal, but salad and desserts is not what i had planned to be eating for $1300 a week. Other than the terrible food when I first arrived to my stateroom there was a used mens underwear on the floor of the bathroom, HOW DISGUSTING. The attendant apologized, but that is still gross. I am 19 years old and went out to get a snack in the promenade at 2am the fourth night. The man serving cookies and sandwiches in the 24 hour promenade REFUSED to serve me because I was 19 and there was a curfew til 1am. First off I have cruised in Royal before and was served every time even when I was 12,14 and 17. Second of all the 'curfew' is up to 18 years of age, so this man had no reason to not give me food. Not only did he refuse, he also threatened to call security on me because of my age and me asking for food. When I told him to call security he went inside and came back two minutes later to serve me food. I had to argue for 20 minutes before I could get food. I did not feel like a guest, I felt like a beggar having to fight for food. This is awful customer service and this ship is an embarrassment to Royal Caribbean, I have been on other of their ships and they were nothing like this garbage. Everything was a line, service was terrible, and the food was quite nasty (breakfast was the worst hands down). I would never pay again to go on this cruise, because I have never been treated so poorly in my life. The only possitive thing I can say about this ship is the construction, interior design and amenities (although there were overwhelming lines for all the activities they were good.) Other than that a huge failure in my opinion. HORRIBLE.
3.0	Sail Date: Aug 01, 2014 /	I definitely felt the WOW effect of the ship. The shows are first class and the divers especially were gorgeous. The waiters were so nice especially the ones we have.
3.0	Sail Date: Aug 01, 2014 /	Good impression\, will book a longer cruise in the future
2.0	Sail Date: Aug 01, 2014 /	"The shows where great.  We where traveling with are only son and he thought the kids clubs were babyish.  They should have a program that gets single kids to buddy up even if it is for a hour to get to know one another.  
The food was bland no spice what so ever.  The pools were way to small for all the people that were on that ship."
3.0	Sail Date: Aug 01, 2014 /	This is our 1st cruise and we were so glad that we selected the Oasis of the seas. I think this is the best of Royal Caribbean cruises. We totally enjoyed every minute on the cruise ship from entertainment to food. The ship is very new and modern. I am afraid that I would not find other cruise that match up to the quality of Oasis of the seas.
5.0	Sail Date: Jul 12, 2014 /	"1st time on this ""big baby"" and WOWW… she's huge! OMG, the zip line was exciting! Next I need to try the flow rider. My husband and I sailed with some friends. Attended 2 of the specialty restaurants which were yummy!"
5.0	Sail Date: Jul 12, 2014 /	The ship was amazing and the service was great. I went with my family and everyone had lots of fun. It was one of my favorite cruises. I do recommend it.

5.0	Sail Date: Jun 21, 2014 /	"Oasis is hard to put into words! It is very large, but is broken up into ""neighborhoods"". I never felt crowded. The food is great and I recommend trying every restaurant."
5.0	Sail Date: Jun 14, 2014 /	My first cruise was on this beautiful ship loved every moment. I took my daughter on The Oasis it was her first cruise and my second time and I plan on many many more
3.0	Sail Date: Jun 01, 2014 /	The ship was very up to date and clean.  Definitely not enough pools/pool space for people to enjoy days at sea.
3.0	Sail Date: Jun 01, 2014 /	This ship will spoil you for other ships
2.0	Sail Date: Jun 01, 2014 /	"I will not go again on royal caribbrean cruise due to un helpful staff

3.0	Sail Date: Jun 01, 2014 /	This was my first cruise and the cruise was wonderful.  Everything was wonderful\, but the room.  I believe that it was to small for two people with separate beds.
3.0	Sail Date: Jun 01, 2014 /	The ship was very Clean and all my encounters with the staff was very nice and helpful\, The hot tubs were awesome not over crowed and no kids.
3.0	Sail Date: Jun 01, 2014 /	There are activities for all age groups.
5.0	Sail Date: May 31, 2014 /	For our 10th wedding anniversary, we sailed on Oasis. Beautiful ship, great food, lots of fun. We loved it.  There was always something to do. Loved the hot tubs and the adults only solarium.
5.0	Sail Date: May 31, 2014 /	This ship was awesome the staff was great. Everyday there was a drink of the day bartender Marvin was awesome everytime he seen my husband witch he called him by name Cisco he said let me put more booze in your cruise we are driving not you. The food was great in the dining room and at the windjammer. Our house keeper was Amazen also came to our room every night to a different towel decoration on our bed. The ports were also great Bahamas, st Thomas and st Martin we did a lot of shopping. Can't wait to go back on another cruise with our kids.
5.0	Sail Date: May 24, 2014 /	This ship was the beginning of a brilliant era of incredible new ships for Royal Caribbean. The Oasis may be a little overshadowed by Harmony and Allure of the Seas, but nonetheless it is still 3rd largest in the world at the moment! I cruised it back when it was in Port Everglades and really enjoyed it. Plenty of things to do onboard.
5.0	Sail Date: May 17, 2014 /	This was my first cruise and all I can say is it set the standard high for all future cruises.   My husband (fiancé then) has cruised 40+ times; Royal Caribbean is his favorite line and Oasis his favorite ship so when he gave me a cruise for my birthday I was excited!  He had just reached Diamond Plus status so there we new perks for him to enjoy too.  The ship is beautiful, truly a floating city with something to do or see every minute of the day and night. Our room -standard balcony- was perfect.   Our stewart saw to our every need, always greeted us by name even if he was several rooms down the hall.        We were treated to several special events - my favorite was the tour of the bridge,  I loved sitting in the captains chair!
2.0	Sail Date: May 03, 2014 /	We were on the Oasis of the seas ship, ship is big and beautiful but the staterooms were cut alot smaller than some of the other smaller ships that I have been on. I could not fully unpack my clothes because of not enough storage space and there was only 2 of us in our balcony stateroom.  The bathroom was even smaller and the bathroom sink was a joke. Royal Caribbean should have cut some of the space in other venues and made their staterooms more comfortable to stay in. Also the crew members actually acted like they really disliked their jobs.  They gave the impression that you were bothering them when you asked them anything and even the bartenders were unhappy and I know that the cruise lines make most of their money selling alcohol and the employees that were in charge on selling drinks were unhappy and drinks were inconsistent.  Really how hard is it to make a strawberry daiquiris!  Royal Caribbean Cruise Line need to educate their staff on policy and procedures because every crew member I asked the same question to gave completely different answers.  They messed up our dinner seating arrangements and I was booked out a year in advance. Most of all if traveling with children even though someone in our group had a passport for their children and we have traveled numerous times with other cruise lines without a problem, Royal Caribbean said they needed their birth certificates and custody papers in which custody of the kids wasn't even a factor. But although they had their passports the had to have their birth certificates emailed to them before they were allowed to board ship and then we found out that that our dinner arrangements were messed up.  Also food choices were limited and the quality of food was poor.  I felt nickeled and dimed with everything you had to pay extra for on this cruise line compared to other cruise lines I was on a daily the quality wasn't even there at all. I would never cruise Royal Caribbean again!
3.0	Sail Date: May 01, 2014 /	As a first time cruiser\, our family can say with pleasure we had a memorable time at the Oasis of the Seas cruise ship. To start\, you will never be bored. (If you are an adventurer) There are many complimentary dining options\, a skating rink\, a variety of theater shows and entertainment\, a mini water park\, zip lining\, golf\, basketball\, table tennis\, and many more activities. I would recommend this ship to anyone!
3.0	Sail Date: May 01, 2014 /	THe ship overall is good which killed my recommendation is the size of the stateroom we had thee people in the room when the bed was pulled out you had a hard time moving in the room. had to put some furniture out on the balcony no room for luggage. if you are elderly dont book this cruise unless you get a suite
3.0	Sail Date: May 01, 2014 /	"I liked the Hospitality of the crew. I will like to mention the waiter named\, GodoFredo\, Ruben were wonderful. Room attendant Brian. And dining hall manager Mr Sam.

3.0	Sail Date: May 01, 2014 /	The ship was state of the art with many things to do.  It was also easy to find quiet areas where we prefered to be alone or with fewer passengers.  The staff were extremely helpful and courteous.  Our accommodations were very nice and fully adequate.

THE FOOD WAS EXCELLENT AND THE SHIP WAS VERY\, VERY CLEAN AND LARGE. I GOT LOST A COUPLE OF TIMES\, HOWEVER\, THE CREW ASSISTED ME AND GAVE DIRECTIONS TO GET TO THE AREA AND BACK TO MY CABIN. I HAD AN EXCEPTIONAL GREAT TIME AND WOULD SAIL ON THE OASIS OF THE SEAS OR ANY ROYAL CARIBBEAN CRUISE SHIPS.
2.0	Sail Date: May 01, 2014 /	The ship was impressive but carried too many people.Royal Carribean did not give us a table assignment so we started out poorly. We were not informed of our formal dress requirements so we were embarrassed and had to pay to eat elsewhere on the boat. Because we booked our excursions through Marriott rather tha Royal Caribbean we were told that we were in danger and that the ship would leave without us if we did not get back on time. We also were cheated out of our Internet time three time by deceptive advertising an when I complained the person lectured me.
3.0	Sail Date: May 01, 2014 /	This is a fantastic ship. While huge\, it really handles the crowds well. The staff is friendly and very helpful in all aspects. The ports on the Eastern route were good but to short. Try to see life beyond the ports. The shows were excellent and the specialty food was excellent. I've experienced larger\, more selection buffets\, but this one was adequate. The rooms were small even with a balcony\, but there is not reason to stay in them long...they were fine for this trip. Make the most of the week and try to get a sense of the layout before you go. Skip the hot room in the spa...too tiny for the ship and price. Gym is amazing...plan on working out at least once. Kids programs were tremendous.
2.0	Sail Date: Apr 05, 2014 /	ship is to big would be impossible to evuacate in case of emergency.no access to life jackets.the condition of the ship was not up to par had rusted out trash containers at the atratiam bar .would not recomend this ship,built strickley for fast dollar. all shows were booked,unable to attend which left nothing to do except walk around a over crowded ship
4.0	Sail Date: Apr 05, 2014 /	"Oasis of the Seas was my first cruise, and what a way to introduce myself to the world of cruising!  The ship is a marvel, it truly feels like you are becoming a part of something special when you step on board.  She is the star of every port she sails into, and guests sailing on other ships can frequently be seen staring in awe at our magnificent ride 

ON BOARD EXPERIENCE:  There is no shortage of things to do on board, and for a pre-planner like myself it provides one with plenty of research and reservation options to occupy the time leading up to sail-away day.  While I found the ship very well appointed and stunning in some areas (Central Park, Promenade, Dazzles, Solarium) the over-all decor and feel left the slightest bit to be desired, in my mind. I feel that this comes out of trying to please a mass audience, as opposed to tailoring the decor to a more specific clientele. Sea days (of which there were 3 on my sailing) left the pool areas quite crowded, and we had to go up a deck to the area overlooking the pool to find loungers. That being said, there are so many great areas to spend time on this ship, sea days were quite welcome!  One of my favorite spots was all the way aft, between the Flow-Riders (deck 14 I believe?)  The railing overlooks the aqua theater at the aft of the ship and gives a stunning panoramic view of the ship's wake.  This is a prime spot for sail aways.  I will never forget standing in that spot as we steamed away from St. Maarten, frozen cocktail in hand, gazing back at the island as the sun set on the horizon. 

DINING:  Oasis provides so many options for dining, I barely saw the Main Dining Room or the Windjammer buffet.  It is not only the variety that is so appealing, but the way in which the options are presented.  Rather than having a specialty ""restaurant"" just shoved into whatever part of the ship it could fit, Oasis' size allows her to give these restaurants the space they deserve.  It truly makes these specialty dining venues different and unique venues.  This is best exhibited in Central Park.  Restaurants line the stone paths like a city street, and even provide some outdoor seating.  You truly feel like you are sitting in a land-based restaurant.  Giovanni's Table on the first night of the cruise was especially memorable, we shared delicious Italian wine and food outside, while we watched people walk the tree-lined paths and breathed in the amazing sea breeze.

CABIN:  When we booked this trip we went with a Balcony Guarantee, so we had no real choice in our cabin location.  That being said, the cabin we were given was great.  10312 is port-side aft, quite near to the aqua theater suite on that deck.  The view was spectacular and the location nice and quiet.  Were I to book Oasis again, and get my own choice of cabin location, I would most definitely target something closer to a stairwell or elevator bank.  Otherwise, everything was perfect.  There is nothing like waking up and walking out to your balcony with a cup of coffee to watch the sea slip by quietly beneath you as the sun rises.

PORTS OF CALL:  Oasis' Eastern Caribbean run features stops in Nassau, St. Thomas and St. Maarten.  This being my first cruise it was also my first time in each of these places.  We did not book any excursions in Nassau, and the time spent in port is minimal (only until 2pm) so my exposure to Nassau consisted of leaving the port area, walking up and down one street, then returning to port.  In St. Thomas, Oasis docks in an area a little ways away from what I think is considered the ""main"" cruise ship pier.  A short cab ride gets you to the charming downtown area of Charlotte Amalie.  It is a pleasure to stroll through the streets and window shop there.  Afterwards we went snorkeling in Turtle Cove.  The ride out there was a little long and wet (get your valuables securely sealed in something water-tight BEFORE leaving shore!) but the crew had a good sense of fun.  Snorkeling was good (saw a few sea turtles!) but overall underwhelming once you got past the turtles.  The coral and underwater formations were sort of dull.  In St. Maarten we rented a car for the day and did our own excursions.  Maho Beach (Sunset Bar & Grill if you are trying to Google Maps it) is a MUST!  Standing on the beach as an airplane essentially lands on top of your head is quite the rush.  After Maho we went over to the French side of the island and had lunch at a charming little restaurant which fronts the most beautiful beach I have ever seen, Grand Case Beach.  The water is tranquil and crystal clear.  Afterwards we drove up, up, up into the hills, all the way up to Pic Paradis (Paradise Peak).  The roads were a little choppy to get up here (I wouldn't recommend driving yourself unless you are comfortable with near-offroading conditions) but the views were SPECTACULAR.  You feel like you are on top of the world.  You can also see the cruise ships from one or two spots, looking like little toys down below.  A relatively obscure place that I did not hear much about while doing research, but I cannot imagine why it doesn't get more buzz, it is unreal."
3.0	Sail Date: Apr 01, 2014 /	This is only my 4th cruise.  Having taken my last three on larger Carnival cruises\, this was another step up.  The best things were the shows.  HairSpray was better than John Travolta's version.  The Ice Skating show was great\, too.  The outside diving was fun to watch.
3.0	Sail Date: Apr 01, 2014 /	Given that it is a fairly new ship\, you can expect a very nice clean\, modern ship.  While the ship offered daily events\, due to the size of the ship\, recommendations are high recommended or else you risk not being able to get in due to seating capacity.  Dining wise\, there were several places that offered the same thing for lunch daily\, which got boring halfway through the trip.  While the Windjammer is convenient\, the food selection is very limited and lacking.  Eat in the main dining room instead.  I did not partake in any of the specialty dining areas as I can always choose to eat that at home in New York City\, so I did not see it worthwhile paying extra just to eat there.
3.0	Sail Date: Apr 01, 2014 /	For the largest ship in the world with over 5\,000 vacationers\, there was more than sufficient room for everyone. Great staff\, very helpful.
3.0	Sail Date: Apr 01, 2014 /	The ship was a fantastic voyage with beautiful flora\, fauna\, intricate designs\, awe-inspiring architecture\, elegant dining facilities and easily accessible thoroughfares.
5.0	Sail Date: Mar 22, 2014 /	"(Pros) Second time on this ship and it's still the best deal for the money.  Good size balony cabins, many restaurants to choose from.  Our favorite is the little Cafe in Central Park.  Awesome salads made in front of you along with carved Roast Beef sandwiches.  Booked two more cruises, one on the Allure over Thanksgiving (second time) and one on Freedom next March. 

(Cons) Not to impressed with their loyality program, 8 cruises and all I get is priority check-in.  Also not impressed with their WOW promotional ads.  Seems once you try booking one of these discounted sailings there is always a reason it doesn't apply to you."
5.0	Sail Date: Mar 08, 2014 /	The second cruise I had ever been on and the largest cruise ship in operation at the time! It took a moment to learn where everything was but after the first day it wasn’t intimidating at all and a smaller ship would feel cramped at this point!
3.0	Sail Date: Mar 01, 2014 /	"The ship is massive - with plenty to do a see.  And while it is the largest - you never felt like you were cruising with 6k people.  

We loved all the pools - could always find a seat\, and never felt crowded.  We had children with us\, and even those sections during a spring break week were not overwhelming."
3.0	Sail Date: Mar 01, 2014 /	This cruise is the best cruise you could ever go on. We have been on seven cruises total and this one is the best of the best!We will be booking another cruise on the Oasis of the Seas in 2016.
3.0	Sail Date: Mar 01, 2014 /	"My daughters and I have cruised before on a variety of cruise lines. Most recently, we were on Royal Caribbeans Brilliance of the Seas. The Oasis is twice the size and has many fun new features, but customer service suffered in many ways and the crowds could be a pain at times. We had fun, but Oasis is not perfect.

First the positive aspects of the Oasis:

We loved having so much to do. We were glad that on the 7-day cruise we had 3 days at sea. The ports were interesting, but the ship was the most fun. In particular, we enjoyed the many shows (and even some rehearsals of the water show while waiting to climb the rock wall), the rock wall, the zip line, the ice skating rink, the flowrider and the different neighborhoods. The Boardwalk always had something going on, as did the Royal Promenade. My girls liked the donut shop on the Boardwalk and we all enjoyed some pizza on the Royal Promenade. Our stateroom was near the middle of the ship and was in great shape. I really got a chance to enjoy the balcony on this cruise. 

I also have to comment that even with a huge ship, many logistics are handled really well. Boarding the ship was simple and getting on and off at ports was easy. The private island is also managed very well. They had plenty of lounge chairs in the various beach areas.

The things that were annoying or negative included the following:

While the dining room food is good, the service is average. We felt much more pampered on other cruises  with extra food, special tricks and just general attentiveness and discussion with the waiter and assistant waiter. We felt the same drop in attentiveness on the part of the room steward. It was not until the last day that we realized he had not even been bringing us the kids program information nightly. On our last (RC) cruise, the steward had also offered small bottles of shampoo and conditioner right away and keep us fully stocked through the trip.

The kids programs overall were disappointing. My 1"
3.0	Sail Date: Mar 01, 2014 /	Staff was very friendly.  My servers made me feel very welcome.  The ship was very clean from the inside to outside.  The public restrooms were clean.  The staterooms were well taken care of.

3.0	Sail Date: Mar 01, 2014 /	We loved all of it
3.0	Sail Date: Mar 01, 2014 /	"The ship was huge inside and the amenities were good. Rooms were nice size. A lot to do and see. Highlights were zip-lining on the ship\, parades in the promenade\, the Boardwalk and Central Park\, and seeing \""Hairspray\"". Entertainment was really great! The service was wonderful- dining room and stateroom attendant. The food was just average although Lobster night and the Keylime pie was amazing. The specialty restaurants were really not worth the extra charge. Debarktation was a real nightmare.Waited in line for 2 1/2 hours to disembark."
3.0	Sail Date: Mar 01, 2014 /	I'm a seasoned cruiser and found this ship and crew to be the best.
3.0	Sail Date: Mar 01, 2014 /	The ship was fantastic.  The kids loved it!  The ship was so stable that you didn't even feel it moving.  I loved the variety of activities\, food options and the Starbucks right on the ship!
3.0	Sail Date: Mar 01, 2014 /	The ship is a masterpiece\, It's worth the cruisefare just to see this magnificent ship.
3.0	Sail Date: Mar 01, 2014 /	wonderful experience\,the ship is amazing. The crew very friendly making us feel very welcomed & appreciated. We will return to this great ship for a future adventure
5.0	Sail Date: Feb 08, 2014 /	"We had a lot of fun on our cruise. I recorded some great videos showing some really cool unique things about the ship on my youtube channel.

 

1. a ""Secret"" spot on Oasis of the Seas & Allure of the Seas that a lot of people don't know about. It's a great private balcony and a great place to watch the Auqa shows - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fuy8wTlxhUo

 

2. A cool tour of the whole ship from top to bottom - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=esl4IXt0Aiw

 

Check out the rest of the videos to learn a lot more about the ships before you go on it!"
3.0	Sail Date: Feb 01, 2014 /	"I am too lazy to write a long review... :-)

It's a great fantastic ship. We had a great time."
3.0	Sail Date: Feb 01, 2014 /	Overall it was good but given the cost I thought it could have been better.  I did not like how crowded the boat was with lines to get on and off and lines to get food.  The boat is beautiful and the ports were a lot of fun for the whole family.  Gym & spa were great.  Food and service were disappointing.  Kids club fantastic.  Weather was beautiful.
3.0	Sail Date: Feb 01, 2014 /	Zipline\,  ship\, buffet\, Main dining room
3.0	Sail Date: Feb 01, 2014 /	The ship was very large and seemed very crowded.  There were many eating establishments on board which were not free, unlike most of the other cruise ships we have sailed aboard.  It seemed that because it was such a large expensive ship, Royal Caribbean line was using many different venues to increase its revenue.  I did not believe it was a good buy.
3.0	Sail Date: Feb 01, 2014 /	The ship was amazing and the staff was as good as advertised.
3.0	Sail Date: Feb 01, 2014 /	Very good service for dinning and stateroom assistant
5.0	Sail Date: Jan 25, 2014 /	I would definitely recommend this boat to everyone!  I have been on about 8 cruises (princess and carnival) but this was by far the best!  The boat was gorgeous! Did not seem overly crowded even with 6000+ passengers and the staff was phenomenal! We have never been treated so wonderfully onboard. We had a wedding planned on st Thomas our second port and had a bit of a snafu with timing. Miguel at guest services allowed us unlimited phone calls to st Thomas from the boat free of charge and the salon did an amazing job with hair and make up that morning. The wedding was absolutely perfect and when we returned to our room we were surprised by cupcakes champagne and snacks from Miguel. I can't wait to return!!!
4.0	Sail Date: Jan 18, 2014 /	We have been on several cruises on Carnival, Princess and Royal Caribbean, this was the first time on the very large Oasis Class ships.  I have wanted to try the Oasis since it was built.  Now that I have done it, I prefer the regular sized ships a little better.  All in all, this was a very good cruise.  To be fair several people we met said they only sail on the Oasis or the Allure because they prefer this type of ship.  We had a Central Park Balcony room and I felt like we we staying in a resort hotel that was near the ocean, and you had to walk a half block to get to the beach.  Perhaps if we had an ocean view I would have felt differently.  I did not always feel like I was on a cruise ship.  Lots of variety of places to eat or things to do.  I read other reviews that said that for as many people that were on the ship, there were very few lines.  I did not find this to be true.  If you eat at prime time, we found long lines, difficulty finding seats at the Windjammer Cafe, and long lines for things like the zipline etc. You can work around this, but it was not convienient for us.
3.0	Sail Date: Jan 01, 2014 /	"ship is very good.  the design of the overall ship are very good.  The entertainment was very good. Our inside balcony over the boardwalk on the rear of the ship was very good.  Good to have inside view and ocean view built-in together.
The design of our room was very poor.  The bed is blocking open access to the closet and closet doors with limited opening ability was very hard to deal with."
3.0	Sail Date: Jan 01, 2014 /	This was our third time on the Oasis. We still didn't get to visit every venue! We love cruising.
2.0	Sail Date: Dec 14, 2013 /	"We were very disappointed in Royal Caribbean Oasis of the Seas.  We felt there were more kids than adults on the cruise.  First of all, it was hell from the start.  The baggage person broke the handle of the suitcase while he delivered the suitcase to the room and said he didn't break it while I stood there watching him snap the handle.  The cruise line was kind enough to fix it in one day, brand as new.  That I definitely give five stars.  Next, we felt that the buffet was not that great but the dining room was superior with excellent wait staff.  We had Deacon and Vita...if you choose this cruise sit in there station..they are the best.  Next, please watch your bill as there were many duplicate charges but were reconciled by customer service if you call them that.  They really didn't provide any service in this manner.  Then, last but not least we took a tour which half was cancelled and had a choice either to go on the cruise for 2.5 hours or recieve a complete refund.  They advised us at around 12:00pm which the day was just about over for planning anything so we took the half tour; however, due to the fact that there were 8 boats in St.Maarten the cruise went on for 4.5 hours which we just about missed our boat.  Everyone was upset on the tour as they had other things to do...We didn't even have time to go shopping downtown.  What the cruise should have done is informed all passengers early in the morning instead of in the afternoon and there would have been people taking the refund.  We just found that they were not as organized as they should have been.  The maid service was okay, but we had to ask for shampoo's/soaps at times.

 

Our biggest pet peeve on this cruise was the amount of kids on the cruise.  We estimated half were kids and the rudeness from them were unbelievable.  Running up and down stairs, graphetti in the elevators on the last day of the cruise is unacceptable.  I think the parents just let them run around.  We will not be cruising with Royal again due to the amount of kids on the cruise.

 

This should have been a cruise for kids only called ""Royal Caribbean Cruise Line"".  From the past conversation, kids at a certain age get on free on the cruise and this is probably why there was so many kids.  Found that the boat cruise staff lacked customer service in some areas.  Extremely commercialized than customer oriented.

3.0	Sail Date: Dec 01, 2013 /	The ship was an impressive ship, would love to get back on it but there are not anymore interesting destinations
3.0	Sail Date: Dec 01, 2013 /	You can't change activities/excursions through the cabin online service.  (Must call).  The majority of eating facilities closes while at ports.  So\, if you don't leave the ship restaurant varieties are limited.
3.0	Sail Date: Dec 01, 2013 /	Beautiful ship. There are lots of different places to eat and the ship did not really ever seem crowded except on New Year's Eve.
3.0	Sail Date: Dec 01, 2013 /	Ship was wonderful\, as was the crew. they really bent over backward. Both embarkation and debarcation were flawless.The food was very good. in spite of her size\, we never felt crowded.
5.0	Sail Date: Nov 09, 2013 /	Best cruise we have ever been on. Of course you get tired of the everyday blan food but everything else was amazing. Wouldn't mind going on this boat again.
5.0	Sail Date: Nov 02, 2013 /	PARK'S Café, amazing little place with such big and delicious variety of salads, sandwiches, soups, pastries for which it Will soon become one favorite.
3.0	Sail Date: Nov 02, 2013 /	"I wouldn't have believed that a ship of this size would not feel crowded...but it really didn't.  The only place that was insanely crowded (especially on ""at sea"" days) was Windjammer.  Just too stressful trying to find a seat!  Park Cafe was always much more relaxing...salads were delish...always something unusual. 

 

Don't waste your money doing the Prohibition Event...just a jazz band (they are very good) and free drinks for $35 per person.  We are Diamond, so we always have more than enough free drinks. 

 

Orient Beach Lunch Break...we sat next to a crane & they wouldn't move us!  Diesel smell, noise & crazy people walking under a dangerous crane perched on wet sand...scary.  When we complained to Excursions Desk...they lied and told us no one else complained (we waited a day).  Met some of the other people later on the cruise and they had all complained...really RCCL?!  The other lounges were reserved for another group...NCL...are they more important than RCCL guests??!! 

 

My Time Dining...needs some work...first night they tried to seat us at a table that had non-stop traffic.  Most of the time, the wait staff was overworked and therefore gave sub-standard service.

 

I won't do it again!

 

I did the zipline on the ship...what a hoot!  They told me whoever screamed the loudest would get a gold medal...well, I won the medal...but when I looked down, I saw that the diving show was going on...oops!  The staff for the activities love their work!

 

We did a B2B which made us less stressed about getting in all the activities and shows in the first week.  I love doing B2B...feel special when we get to stay while everyone else is getting off...you just have to walk off & then back on...takes about an hour.

 

I must say the staff on this ship seemed less concerned with guests and more with their clicks...strange.

 

Giovanni's Table was a disappointment...my husband couldn't even cut his veal.  Then this bozo woman comes in and flips out because they wouldn't let her bring a bottle from home in the dining room...duh.  Well, she threw her purse down & it just about hit me.  C'mon, I just want to relax without any drama...I own a restaurant and I am not interested in being around wacko's when I am on vacation!  Well...at least I didn't have to smile and be sweet to her...

 

Izumi was over priced.  Best dinner was at 150 Central Park...good food, relaxing atmoshere & attentive staff.

Ship has major probles with water collecting on deck 14 when it rained.  It became like an ice rink.   There were quite a few people wlking around with casts on their legs....hmmmm

Shows are all good just get there in plenty of time."
4.5	Sail Date: Nov 02, 2013 /	First cruise on an Oasis class ship and we were sold.  First thought it would be intimidating and crowd - neither the case.  Ship is well designed allow for separate areas (neighborhoods) that hide how many people you're actually sailing with.  Food was great - highly recommend the chefs table.   Plan to a sail her in the future.
5.0	Sail Date: Nov 02, 2013 /	We had a suite booked but couldn't afford it when due so called agent to cancel and she got us inside balcony over boardwalk of lines choosing for cheap, so we did and had great time. Only went to dining room first night did dining package and loved every restaurant. 150 Central Park was outstanding and fun.food and service in windjammer was awesome believe it or not. Cabin was small but nice and we could watch water show and the zipline went right over us. The balcony was great to have on the boardwalk. Ship was just amazing. We want to do it again just to see what we missed.our servers and attendants were great. Just a great adventure.
5.0	Sail Date: Nov 02, 2013 /	Me and my friends had a great time. It was my first time being on a ship this big.
3.0	Sail Date: Nov 01, 2013 /	My 4th cruise and in getting better and better
3.0	Sail Date: Nov 01, 2013 /	the best cruise.
3.0	Sail Date: Nov 01, 2013 /	I found stores poor.  They only had very pricey products. Jewelry store was the worst.  I found the same item in St. Thomas and Nassau about $1\,000.00 less. There was no place to sit quietly anywhere on ship.  Lots of things for youngsters.  Little anywhere for older crowd\, especially to sit back and relax.  Service in dining room was VERY slow. There was no easy listening music group in an lounge from about 4 to 6 or 6:30 PM\, so you could unwind.  Boardwalk was okay\, but restaurants are really geared toward youngsters (who exactly is the demographic and who statistically goes on cruises??). Specialty restaurants are too pricey. Our room\, a junior suite\, was very spacious\, and the walk-in closet was fantastic. Debarkation was smooth and quick\, but embarkation was terrible.  We had to wait a rather long time for the clerk to do something\, though she never did explain where she went off to. Need more check-in lines or somewhere to sit during this process. The formal night is a pass idea today.  Airlines charge for suitcases\, and to bring formal or dress clothes usually requires an extra one.  Recommend you find something else to take its place.
3.0	Sail Date: Nov 01, 2013 /	While the ship has 6\,200 passengers on board\, a person could not tell.  There was ample room to walk around and get reservations at the specialty dinning rooms.
3.0	Sail Date: Nov 01, 2013 /	"size
beautiful theaters 
smooth movements
no dizziness or nausea
excellent dinning staff"
2.0	Sail Date: Nov 01, 2013 /	"I was very disappointed.  The cruise staff was not friendly.  Everyone acted as though they did not want to be there.  A staff member yelled at me.  

Royal Caribbean needs to get it together."
3.0	Sail Date: Nov 01, 2013 /	If you want an amusement park at sea go for it. If you want a real cruise don't. We were very impressed with boarding and disembarking but in between was not what we have come to enjoy about cruising.
5.0	Sail Date: Oct 26, 2013 /	sailed in 2013, my first cruise. everything was wonderful, the food, staff, ports, everything. I've just booked my next one on Allure. Oasis set the bar very high!
5.0	Sail Date: Oct 12, 2013 /	Love the 2x was on it. Food was great cabins were clean and well kept.  Staff was wonderful.Had so much fun I just  wanted to go back as soon as left!
3.0	Sail Date: Oct 01, 2013 /	Oasis was the bet ship of our 18 cruises by far.
3.0	Sail Date: Oct 01, 2013 /	This is my 2nd cruise with Royal  Caribbean and it meet my expectation..love love it
3.0	Sail Date: Oct 01, 2013 /	"Cabins are very roomy\, but getting to the closet was tight. Nice sitting area with big sofa. Would have like one chaise lounge on the balcony instead of two chairs. Nice shower with glass shower door. Everything worked well in the cabin and of course the cabin staff was always on top. We sampled most of the complimentary restaurants; Opus Dining Room\, Park Cafe\, Windjammer Buffet\, the donut shop\, Caf Promenade\, Sorrento's Pizza\, Wipe Out Cafe\, and Johnny Rockets for which we paid a cover charge. All the food was delicious. From our \""inside\"" balcony overlooking the Boardwalk we were able to watch the events at the aqua theater and climbers on the rock wall and everyone going on the zipline. We watched people play basketball on the courts and we even played nine holes of miniature golf. We also watched kids and adults try their surfing skills on the two flowriders and the ship even has an ice rick for up to 50 people at a time! You need to make reservations for the shows on the first day if not before\, because by the time you get settled in\, you can't get in. Same with specialty dining. One week is not enough time to get to really know and experience the ship. I would advise taking back to back cruises."
3.0	Sail Date: Oct 01, 2013 /	The Oasis of the Seas was an impressive ship to look at. It was an impressive ship to make a first cruise in. However I would warn you that you probably would not want to cruise on another line or even another ship. You are really spoiled on this one.
3.0	Sail Date: Oct 01, 2013 /	If people complaint about anything from RCL and particular Allure & Oasis\, they need to stay inland ... Services is a WOW all over the place....from check in to check out...  WE LOVE IT
3.0	Sail Date: Oct 01, 2013 /	Even with over 5000 people on board the ship you did not feel crowed.  There was always multiple shows going on at the same time to break everyone up.  With two decks to sit in the sun there was always plenty of chairs.  The ship did have a lot for you to do and keep you busy\, but the real fun was crashing the singles cruise that was going on.  They had a lot better activities.
5.0	Sail Date: Sep 14, 2013 /	"From the time I got out of the limo until the time I departed, I had an excellent experience aboard the Oasis of the Seas! I was worried about the time it would take to get onboard, we left the hotel at noon and I was onboard with a drink in my hand on the top deck at 12:32!! I could not believe how efficient these poeple were! I was told by other travelers that our room wouldn't be ready until the evening, which wasn't a problem, but we decided to check on it and it was ready much earlier. The room was decent sized for a cruise ship, everything worked as intended and the water pressure was surprisingly better than expected. Every show that I saw on the ship was a delight, from the broadway play to the ice show (which I watched twice, because I thought it was so good!) to the watershow were all spectacular. The food was, as well, outstanding. I would recommend this cruise and this ship to anyone. I have talked several of my friends to join us on the Allure of the Seas next year for another fantastic time! The only slightly negative thing I have is the beds were pushed together to make a larger bed and it was uncomfortable to try to sleep next to my wife with a ""hump"" in the middle of the bed. After an entire week on the ship and that's the only complaint I have, I think I can live with it!"
3.0	Sail Date: Sep 01, 2013 /	It is a beautiful ship\, loved how you didn't run over people though.
3.0	Sail Date: Sep 01, 2013 /	Amazing\, beautiful\, huge and very clean ship.
3.0	Sail Date: Sep 01, 2013 /	"Ship was too large for us. Our room was way to small for a balcony room. Could barely get past the beds.
Did not care for having to make arrangements to go eat a see shows.Missed two because of it."
3.0	Sail Date: Sep 01, 2013 /	"We've been on many Royal Caribbean cruises and didn't think we could be \""wowed\""\, but we were.  We would recommend very highly."
5.0	Sail Date: Aug 24, 2013 /	"No matter how many curises you have been on the Oasis of the Seas in a very special not to be missed adventure on the hight seas. So many venues and specialty restaurants.  So much to do in so little time.  From activities to just kicking back and relaxing this cruise is not to be missed.

If you love to swim or just soak in a t tub all of the numerous pools onboard are fresh water pools.  For sports activities would you belive Ice skating, surfing and rock climbing all on board or join in a game on the basketball court.  Great activities for the kids and grandkids.

While we have cruised before, this is the first time we ever treated ourselves to a Grand Suite.  Two reasons.  We never spend alot of time in our cabins.  We always looked at the price of the cruise. The thing is, they never really tell you much amount the amenities that go with the suite.  Talk about feeling like royalty, A private quiet club where you can order breakfast and lunch from a menu in a quite setting away fromn the madding crowds.  Then there are free drinks and hor dourves from 5 to 8 each evening. Reserved seating for shows. A private deck area with padded lounge chairs.  I could go on and on.  Try it! You'll like it! Worth the added price.

If you want to learn more about cruise ships and get a chance take the limited access tour.  It is worth the price to see the inner workings of a cruise ship.

I could go on and on but could never really cover it all.  Sail the Oasis you will never forget it."
5.0	Sail Date: Aug 17, 2013 /	"Let me start by saying this ship is everything I dreamed of and more. This was a once in a lifetime experience. The process of boarding and disembarking this ship was very easy. They are very organized and know exactly how to make getting on board as well as leaving the ship run smooth.

We arrived at the terminal about 10 am, they started boarding at 11:30 we were on board at 11:46. Pictures and videos I've seen about this ship does not do it justice. The Oasis is so beautiful. What I love about boarding is that all their venues that serve lunch were open and ready for everyone to have lunch. We walked through The Royal Promenade on deck 5. Then we headed to deck 8 Central Park. We enjoyed The Park Cafe's famous Kummelwreck sandwich. Then headed up to deck 16 to the Windjammer buffet. our cabins were ready at 1:30pm. We loved our balcony room on deck 10 it was very spacious. Lots of closet space and they provided a ton of hangers.

Food: Free Options

Opus Dining Room: 
                                this is the main dining room with access from Deck 3, 4 and 5. We choose My Time Dining, which we enjoyed because we planned dinner around all the shows we went to. Deck 5 is for only cruisers doing my time dining, you can make reservations based on your schedule for that day. We noticed even those that didn't make reservations were seated. If you want the same waiter each night you need to request it. The wait staff are so friendly and accommodating. We loved our waiter Jason and his Asst. Radney.

We also had  breakfast here twice. You can opt to order from a menu or you can do the breakfast buffet.

Wipe Out Cafe:
                          this is a great place to get breakfast on deck 15. Never was a long line and what's awesome about it is you can get fresh made omelettes. They have typical breads, bacon, sausage, fruit and different stuff to choose from.

WindJammer Buffet:
                           You can have breakfast,lunch and dinner here. Here depending on when you come you can expect a line. It does move fast. The workers are friendly and will help you with anything that you need. We only ate here a couple of times. 

Solarium Bistro:
                             This is located on Deck 15 you can have breakfast and lunch here complimentary. They also offer dinner but you have to pay for it. This is great healthy option.

Sorrento's
                          this is on deck 5 The Royal Promenade, OMG the pizza was great and I love how they offered different flavors as well as they will make you a personal pizza based on the toppings they have. 

Cafe Promenade:       also deck 5 they great cookies and desserts as well as little sandwiches. They're open 24 hours.
Park Cafe :
                                this is on deck 8 in  Central Park. You can make your own salad as well as get great sandwiches here. Great option.

Doughnut shop: this is on deck 6 on the Boardwalk

Paid Options

Speciality Restaurants
Deck 8 Central Park 
                We bought the Central Park Dining package for 70 per/person 

Giovanni's Table Italian Trattoria 
                                                 : this place was amazing, romantic dining experience.5 Course  meal  dessert was memorable. We had a rum raisin Gelato which was to die for.
Chops Grill:
                                  great experience, Filet Minion awesome and leave room for  Red Velvet for dessert  Staff is awesome they will wrap up dessert for you.
150 Central Park:  
                             very elegant restaurant 6 course meal prepared by the chef. Let them know if you have any allergy's. 

Entertainment: 
                          Wow what can I say we absolutely loved all the shows. One word of advice prebook the show times you want before going on the ship because if you don't unfortunately they do get sold out. As soon as the shows open up I advise you to book them. All the shows are a must see, Hair Spray, Frozen in time, Oasis Dream,The Headliner show, Come Fly with me and the Comedy Show.
                             They have so many activities everything was awesome. The pools we're always busy but the best part is on Port days if you get back before ship leaves usually not a lot of people. So many Jacuzzi to choose from that was awesome. They have a ton of deck chairs so you can always find chairs available.

All I can say is be ready for a trip of a lifetime. Our first time on Royal Caribbean and we're already planning on going on the Quantum of the seas."

Stateroom attendant left patio door open and it melted my medicine. 
My wife is pregnant and they had no running water in the bathrooms the last day of the cruise!!!!
Do not go. Been on several RCC cruises, and this ship is in need of repair!"

3.0	Sail Date: Jul 01, 2013 /	A great ship! I had fun just walking around the ship. There was always something to do. Even with the large number of passengers\, I was able to alway find some privacy.
3.0	Sail Date: Jul 01, 2013 /	Great ship. Lots to do.  Only bad thing is lines at wind jammer for lunch and breakfast. They seat you at wind jammer which just slows line and backs up everything.
3.0	Sail Date: Jun 01, 2013 /	Oasis of the seas is a great cruise for a family vacation. There were plenty of activities on board that we never had a chance to go through them all. Nightly entertainment was superior compared to previous cruises we have been on. Hairspray, the ice skating, aqua show and comedy club were amazing! We were never bored. Great ship just to walk around and enjoy the scenery - take a stroll through central park, plenty of nice shops, beautiful carrousel for kids, and fun a casino for adults! Jacuzzi's and zip lining on the upper decks were fun! Would definitely recommend a journey on the Oasis!
3.0	Sail Date: Jun 01, 2013 /	Wow!!! This was an amazing cruise. We loved it!!
3.0	Sail Date: Jun 01, 2013 /	"This was our first time on a cruise and we sailed on the Oasis Eastern Caribean. It was a very good experince and the ship was beautiful, the service was amazing, and the food incredible. Lots to do and lots of entertainment.  The shows were very top notch and professional.  We loved them alll and really enjoyed them.
Our only complaint is that we paid an extra $800 for an all inclusive alcohol and beverage package yet had to pay extra for any drinks on room service or any pop or water in the mini fridge."
3.0	Sail Date: Jun 01, 2013 /	I would travel again with Royal Caribbean... they truly understand about customer service.  First problem encountered was the dinner arrangements for 14 that  was supposed to arrange was not done so the dining crew on the ship made the fix and that part of the cruise was probably one of the best parts ~ dinner every night was everyone to reflect on their day. Will definitely use Royal Caribbean again NOT
4.0	Sail Date: Jun 01, 2013 /	Although we had a wonderful time on the OASIS, we found ourselves a bit dismayed at staffers who were not familiar with the ship. Yes, the crew was Unfamiliar and appeared Stressed. This disposition in no way added to the quality of our vacation where we are accustomed to chit-chatting with the crew and enjoying our total surroundings. In the main dining room, where the food that finally reached us was truly delicious, the poor disposition of the attendants prevailed. Subsequently, we stopped going to the dining room and located eateries elsewhere. Later on into the cruise, we found out that most of the crew were not working on adequate sleep. OVERWHELMED and OVERWORKED! Our personal solution: not to embark on a brand new ship until it has matured its staff. We have not been on the OASIS since, but I am sure we will again. After all, OASIS is a lovely ship with many themed areas aboard and the shows we were able to attend, were great! Speaking of shows, this was also our first experience of having to pre-book (even the free shows, COMEDY) since attendance was limited.

3.0	Sail Date: Jun 01, 2013 /	My family went to the West Caribbean trip at the end of June. We like the ship but disappointed at their service. It's a big and beautiful ship but they can't handle this many people.
5.0	Sail Date: May 25, 2013 /	This ship was so much fun! Loved all of the stops! Had an amazing vacation! There is so much to do! Hope to go back on the Oasis of the Seas again! 🏝⚓️🚢

3.0	Sail Date: May 01, 2013 /	Huge ship but did not feel as if it was crowded. Cleanliness and friendliness of staff. The Royal Carribean staff were wonderful.
3.0	Sail Date: May 01, 2013 /	I was blown away by this trip. Awesome trip with a great ship\, great food and great service.
3.0	Sail Date: May 01, 2013 /	Ship was awesome! I loved it when we were docked next to other ships and we were definitely the BIG PAPA!! The cleanliness was very much appreciated.
3.0	Sail Date: May 01, 2013 /	The ship was more than I expected.  I always had new adventures everyday to explore on the ship.  The staff from the cleaning crew to the executive staff were extremely helpful!
3.0	Sail Date: May 01, 2013 /	The ship was beautiful and very well kept!  Staff were very nice and always willing to do what ever necessary to accomodate your requests.  They were always willing to go above and beyond to ensure you had the best vacation possible.
3.0	Sail Date: May 01, 2013 /	My husband and I feel so at home away from home .  We love to walk passed the  beautiful garden on our way to our cabin.  Seven nights is too short to be in Oasis.
3.0	Sail Date: May 01, 2013 /	This cruise was great.  There was a lot of activities all of the time.  The room over board walk was a little nosy because of the teen activities in the evening on the top deck
5.0	Sail Date: Apr 27, 2013 /	What's not to love? This is the ship everyone in port wishes they were on. So many great things about this floating city. We had a room with a view of central park (gorgeous). Check out Park Cafe for the customizable bagel bar. Hello smoked salmon! This will go down as one of our favorites for sure!
4.0	Sail Date: Apr 27, 2013 /	"WE HAD A VERY GOOD TIME ON THIS SHIP. THE OASIS IS IS VERY LARGE COMPARED TO OTHER SHIPS THAT WE HAVE BEEN ON. THERE WAS SO MUCH TO DO AND SEE. THE FOOD WAS GOOD AND PLENTIFUL. THE SERVICE WAS GOOD. THE STAFF TRIES VERY HARD TO KEEP YOU ENTERTAINED. THE SHOWS WERE GOOD. THE SHIP BOOSTS A FLOW RIDER AND ZIP LINE, NUMEROUS POOLS AND SPAS, PLENTY OF SPACE TO SIT AND LOUNGE.
THE PORTS OF CALL WERE OK,BUT WHEN YOU ARE ON THE OASIS IT MIGHT BE BETTER TO STAY ON THE SHIP AND ENJOY WHATS GOING ON ON THE SHIP ITSELF. I FELT THAT THE SHIP WAS THE EXPERIENCE, THE PORTS WERE JUST A ADDED BENEFIT. I WOULD STRONGLY RECOMMEND THIS SHIP TO EXPERIENCED CRUISERS. FOR FIRST TIMERS IT MIGHT SEEM OVER WHELMING. IF YOU ENJOY CRUISING OTHER SHIPS WILL FALL SHORT OF YOUR EXPECTATIONS. THE ONLY RAP ON THIS SHIP IS THAT BECAUSE OF IT'S SIZE AT TIMES IT SEEMED CROWDED AT CERTAIN TIMES, DINNER, SHOW TIMES AND AT THE PORTS OF CALL WHEN PEOPLE ARE TRYING TO GET OFF.
OVER ALL GOOOOOD EXPERIENCE."
5.0	Sail Date: Apr 06, 2013 /	Simply put.......AMAZING!  I have been on 9 cruises, 7 of which were Royal Caribbean, and I refuse to cruise on any other cruise line.  The best cruise I have ever been on, it leaves you wanting more, even after 7 days.  From the service to the entertainment, Five Star all the way.
3.0	Sail Date: Apr 01, 2013 /	The ship is amazing! We probably only visited a small part of the ship as there were new areas we were always exploring.  The greatest thing was being able to relax in the solarium for 3 days at sea with nothing to do or worry about.  Really great staff and no lack of food.  Highly recommended!
3.0	Sail Date: Apr 01, 2013 /	Great ship that is well appointed with a number of a activities to experience
5.0	Sail Date: Mar 16, 2013 /	I ABSOLUTELY love the Oasis class ships.  Some don’t like them because they’re too big.  I love them for that reason.  So much more.  I spent hours with friends having drinks and playing cards on the rising tide bar.  I enjoyed the cupcake cupboard (when it was there) and everyone seem to flock to my group when it came to partying.  We met our now good friends in the Champagne Bar and go cruising all the time together.  We’ve made some memories on this ship.  Grand is better :-)
3.0	Sail Date: Mar 01, 2013 /	We had big expectations before the vacation and luckily we didn't have to be disappointed because the ship was just great.
3.0	Sail Date: Mar 01, 2013 /	Awesome experience - beautiful and huge ship with everything imaginable on board. Live trees\, ice skating\, mall shopping\, three tier level dinner Restaurant. Touch sc1reen room\, food\, event locator on every floor everywhere. Beautiful Parade and costumes. Loved Flash Mob too.
3.0	Sail Date: Mar 01, 2013 /	Loved the layout of the ship. The specialty restaurants were five star all the way. All of the staff went out of their way to accomodate our needs. There are standards of conduct for passengers which is explained up front. This alleviates inappropriate behavior among ship's passangers. It was a very pleasant experience.
5.0	Sail Date: Feb 16, 2013 /	"The Oasis of the Seas was an experience unlike any other ship. There was so much to see just on the ship itself. There was almost no reason to venture off the ship. Considering the size of the vessel, everything went smoothly from embarkation day in Fort Lauderdale, Florida til the end of the cruise.

Compared to other ships, this one tops them all in size and entertainment opportunities. Shows were phenomenal, including the Aqua show! Where else can you see a live acrobatic water show at sea? If walking is your thing, one lap around the walking path on sports deck is a 3 mile walk. Yes, it's a 3 mile walk. The ship is a gym membership in itself with all the stairs and walking from one end to the other.

We did the My Time Dining as our dining plan. However, we felt that it was not for us. My suggestion is that if you're in a group or want to dine alone it's a great option. But if you want to get to meet people, opt for regular seating.

Prior to boarding, it was recommended to book all shows and dining. I'm glad I did because if one had waited til the cruise, it would have been slim pickings. So definitely take the time and think out your nightly entertainment and dining before hand and make those reservations online before you leave.

Overall, Oasis of the Seas was a great choice. If I had to pick a ship again, Oasis and her sister, Allure, would be one of my choices."
3.0	Sail Date: Feb 01, 2013 /	This ship is simply amazing. Filled with places to go, things to do and new experiences to enjoy.
3.0	Sail Date: Feb 01, 2013 /	tons of fun!!
3.0	Sail Date: Feb 01, 2013 /	always something to do.
3.0	Sail Date: Feb 01, 2013 /	The ship was top notch! I felt I paid for the best....and that's what we received. The service was impeccable. The ship was very modern\, spacious and never felt crowded. I would highly reccommend!
3.0	Sail Date: Feb 01, 2013 /	We loved cruising the Allure last year\, and wanted to try the Oasis this year as it also offered a different itinerary.  While our cruise was wonderful\, there were a few things that we found different compared to our cruise last year.  While our state room attendand was phenomenal as was all of the wait staff\, we found some of the other services (delivery of luggage\, champagne ordered but not in the room\, tuxedos rented\, but not in the room.)
3.0	Sail Date: Feb 01, 2013 /	A beautiful ship!  The Royal Promenade\, Central Park\, and Boardwalk gave people a chance to spread out.
5.0	Sail Date: Jan 19, 2013 /	"Wow!  What a large and luxurious ship.  Everything about this cruise was awesome...the entertainment, friendliness of ALL the crew, food, etc.  Couldn't have asked for more.  Thought it would take me forever to familiarize myself with the layout of the ship but was surprised by how easy it was.  There were MANY folks on board but everything was so organized that it appeared to slow nicely.

Wonderful memories and lots to do if you chose to do it!"
4.0	Sail Date: Jan 05, 2013 /	The cruise it self was absolutely wonderful! We traveled in an inside cabin. I felt very claustrophobic in the cabin because there is absolutely NO room in them! The closets were fine but the restroom, sink, and shower was abnormally close to each other. The food on the other hand was exquisite! I loved the lobster and the royal shrimp cocktail. And don't get me started on desert! The creme brule and ice cream were perfect! We traveled as a family for my birthday. For desert I enjoyed a fantastic birthday cake. On the pool deck, you would be able to find ice cream dispensers. Each has chocolate, vanilla, or chocolate AND vanilla! Unfortunately, the ice creams were always a bit slushy. The best ice cream could be bought or ordered for desert at the main dinning room.
3.0	Sail Date: Jan 01, 2013 /	Similar to Allure. Good food, good entertainment. Just wished the stayed longer at Nassau though.
3.0	Sail Date: Jan 01, 2013 /	"Even though there were 6\,200 passengers and more than 2\,000 staff\, you never felt crowded. The ship was clean and accessible in all areas. The use of the digital \""notebook\"" allowed for a passenger to check activities and find his or her way throughout the ship."
3.0	Sail Date: Jan 01, 2013 /	This is amazing cruise.
3.0	Sail Date: Jan 01, 2013 /	This is my second time sailing Oasis of the Seas. The ship is amazing! It's very impressive\, my favorite pool is the Sand Bar where waves actually wash up to your pool chair\, so fun!
5.0	Sail Date: Dec 15, 2012 /	"This was our first cruise and by mistake hubby made reservations on the largest ship on the seas.  It was a great cruise.  Of course hubby has me

very spoiled.  There was so much activity on board that you couldn't do everything.  Hubby made reservations for an Ocean view stateroom.

The food was fabulous.  We loved the shows and all of the shopping specials."
3.0	Sail Date: Dec 01, 2012 /	We enjoyed our relaxation on the boat when we where on. We just went to relax and be together and enjoy some sites.
3.0	Sail Date: Dec 01, 2012 /	Perfect trip!
3.0	Sail Date: Dec 01, 2012 /	This ship was awesome. There is so much to do and see we could not fit it all in on a 7 day cruise. We will definitely return and highly recommend a trip aboard this ship if big is what you want.
3.0	Sail Date: Dec 01, 2012 /	What a truly amazing ship.  Even though there were 5500 passengers\, it was never crowded anywhere.  This ship is run like a well-oiled machine; from embarking to disembarking\, everything went very smoothly and efficiently.  Staff was wonderful and very friendly and accommodating  Food was great\, and shows were excellent.
5.0	Sail Date: Nov 17, 2012 /	"This was my first cruise and there were about 30 in my group.  I could hardly believe I was on a ship.  From the second I stepped on and to the moment I left, I was awed.  The service was far beyond excellent.  I did not want to go to bed at night for fear of missing something.  We had a Thanksgiving Day parade which was jaw dropping.  The ""neighborhoods"" were excellent.  We walked through Central Park and went to Broadway.  Some in my group did the zip line, that was not for me, but fun to watch.  My nephew became a pro at ""surfing"".  We saw ""Hairspray"" which was excellent.  All the shows were great.  When I was too tired to move and I just sat and watched the ""world"" go buy.  Something to do for everyone.  Make this a must on your ""bucket list"""
5.0	Sail Date: Nov 17, 2012 /	My family is 12 if ya sailed on Oasis of the Seas and I have to say it was the best cruise we went on. Never a dull moment always something to do. We especially loved the wave runner and the rock wall. We got lost a few times but the kids always knew where to go. We had a total of 4 balcony rooms and we all opened the dividers and enjoyed the big balcony. If you book on her you will not be sorry.
3.0	Sail Date: Nov 01, 2012 /	The ship itself was great. The pools were a bit small for the amount of people on board however overall no complaints.
3.0	Sail Date: Nov 01, 2012 /	Everyone should try OASIS (or ALLURE) at least once in their life. It's a city-at-sea.
3.0	Sail Date: Nov 01, 2012 /	We loved the cruise! Exceeded all our expectations!
5.0	Sail Date: Oct 27, 2012 /	Great ship went to Mexico, beautiful big so much to do on the ship. A+++++. Would love to go on some of the other big ships.  Now when on smaller ships you get to know people after 7 days .
3.0	Sail Date: Oct 01, 2012 /	"The Oasis of the Sea was just like RCL said,\""The largest cruise ship on the Ocean\"". The ship was so large that I didn't get the chance to do everything and see everything.  The ship is clean, staff is friendly, room are spacious, food was good, the entertainment was amazing. The number of pools and whirlpools was great. It sometimes felt that there weren't that many people on board but there was. I had a great time."
3.0	Sail Date: Oct 01, 2012 /	Great experience on such a large boat. Boat itself was worth the cruise. But, with its size there are some drawbacks.
2.0	Sail Date: Oct 01, 2012 /	I have never been on a cruise with so many mistakes and such a lack of caring by the staff.  Please read on to see just some of the problems.  Diamond Club was tucked away in a musty, windowless and viewless bar.   Ship does not stop in Caymans as advertised.  Ship does not offer cooking classes as advertised.
5.0	Sail Date: Oct 01, 2012 /	it was awesome!
5.0	Sail Date: Oct 01, 2012 /	The size of the ship and all of the different things you could do
3.0	Sail Date: Oct 01, 2012 /	Recently cruised on the Oasis of the Seas. What a great ship!! I have sailed many times on Royal Caribbean and Celebrity and I must say this trip was extraordinary. Central Park at sea?  The shows wre top-notch, the restaurants, most particularly 150 Central Park were top notch as were the multitude of different attractions on this ship. In addition, we were right behind Hurricane Sandy and felt a few bumps the last night because of the size of the ship. I look forward to cruising the Oasis or Allure again.
5.0	Sail Date: Sep 15, 2012 /	From MeetOnCruise iPhone App:
5.0	Sail Date: Sep 01, 2012 /	"Although the sheer size of the ship intimidates many passengers, I absolutely loved all the extra amenities and options. The Oasis is so massive that it feels like you are at a large hotel or resort rather than on a ship. We never felt the movement of the ship. When we booked our cruise, we did not even look at the ship's itinerary. We just wanted to experience the ship and the Oasis did not disappoint. Our 7-night Western Caribbean cruise left from Ft Lauderdale, FL and visited Labadee, Haiti, Falmouth, Jamaica and Cozumel, Mexico. The ship is doing something right as each sailing is fully booked our captain told us and on our cruise there were 150 passengers on back-to-back cruises.
As recommended by RCCL, we pre-booked online all our reservations for dinners and shows. I have to admit it took some time for me to do all this but it was well worth the effort. Our cruise document, Guest Ticket Booklet listed a summary of all our reservations in a neat format so we had no trouble knowing where we should be each day. I just added in everything else we wanted to do daily on the same page once we were onboard. You can wait to make reservations on the interactive TV in your stateroom but you may not get the times that you want. It also helps if you sign the waiver ahead of time for Zip Lining, ice skating, Rock Climbing Walls or the Flow Riders. 
We parked at an offsite parking lot and arrived at the terminal before the ship was cleared for boarding so we waited 15 minutes for the process to start. It was done very orderly starting with those occupying suites followed by repeat passengers at descending award levels. Within ten minutes we were onboard. We chose to eat at Sorrento's, a pizzeria rather than try finding a table in what we knew would be a very crowded Windjammer Buffet Restaurant. There was no line here and we were able to order pizzas with our choice of toppings. We sat at a small table and people watched until our pizzas were brought to us. Afterwards, we had a snack at the Cafeacute; Promenade (opened 24 hrs.) We then toured the ship until our stateroom was ready at 1PM. 
Our quiet Central Park Balcony Stateroom, Category C1, Deck 12 #647 was quite unique as it was actually an inside cabin yet the balcony was open to the sky. Although smaller than ones we had on Carnival cruises, the stateroom held all our possessions with plenty of hangers and shelf space. My husband wished for more drawer space but we managed nicely. The cabin was airy with light colored walls, furniture, colorful carpet, full length mirror and attractive wall hangings. The king bed was very comfortable with plenty of pillows. We had a sofa, desk, chair, flat screen TV and small open end tables. Our Stateroom Attendant, Michael Cambronero, was helpful, accommodating, professional and friendly. He called us by name and often gave us tips on what to do or see. We requested ice and toiletries and he replenished them automatically as needed. 
Before sailing, we attended the mandatory Safety Drill which for me was a waste. I was sitting behind a column and could not see any of the video. Our Muster Station was an overcrowded bar lounge where many passengers had to stand. We were lucky to have seats. After the drill, we went up on deck for the Sail Away Party.
We ate all our dinners in the MDR as the food there was fine. We selected My Time Diningr yet every night the hostess put us at the same table with the same Head Waiter, Server and assistant server. We rarely waited on a long line since we dined each night around 6-6:30. Lines began forming after 7 PM. Beginning with our September 1, 2012 sailing, the Oasis instituted brand new menus. I appreciated that every night my favorites, Escargot, Shrimp Cocktail and Cregrave;me Brulee were on the menu. Service was professional, friendly and most of our needs were actually anticipated by the excellent staff who all worked together seamlessly. I can't give enough praise to Roshan Sousa, Head Waiter, Chante, our Server and John, Assistant Server as well as the competent front reception desk hostesses. I also enjoyed the beautiful classical background dinner music.
The public areas of the ship were awesome. Standouts were the lively Royal Promenade and the seaside-themed Boardwalk areas. Although both areas can get crowded for events, they are still fun places to visit, shop, eat and people watch. We rode the beautiful Carousel and stopped by the Psychic Booth in Boardwalk. We shopped in the Royal Promenade boutiques and checked out the various lounges and bars nightly. It was always fun strolling through Central Park especially at night under the stars. With twenty-one pools and whirlpools, we never had trouble finding a lounge chair in the shade. We enjoyed the quiet and warm Solarium pool. The Opal Theater and the Casino Royale were lovely.
What impressed me the most about the ship, however was the massive open air Aqua Theater with two large screen TVs showing 3D movies. Don't miss the amazing Oasis of Dreams Aqua Show. It is a must - take my word for it. The daring aerial talent, skill and showmanship of all the divers, gymnasts and synchronized swimmers are superb. Do not sit in the splash zone unless you want to get wet. The Fountain Show was also fun to watch.
There were many other unique and fun things that impressed me, too. The Rising Tides Bar located in the Royal Promenade (it ascends  descends 8 stories) was a real novelty. The ice skating rink where you can skate for free - long pants and socks required was a must do for me. I did not realize how rusty my ice skating was. I enjoyed watching the whimsical Frozen in Time Ice Show, and attending the Cosmic Ice Skating Party. Splish Splash Comedy Dive was entertaining to watch. If you only go to one show, make it the spectacular Come Fly with Me. I was awed by the amazing aerial performances and scenic backdrops. Do not miss the wonderful Hairspray Broadway Musical Comedy, either. The actors put their hearts and souls into the show. Another highly entertaining performance was Headliner Showtime starring Earl Turner. His singing talent and personality had everyone in the audience engaged. Try to attend at least one comedy show. The acts here are truly funny without being vulgar. If you are more adventuresome than I was, try the exciting Flow Riders and Rock Climbing Walls. It is also just fun to watch others try. I also thoroughly enjoyed all the DreamWorks* Experiences and Character photo opportunities with Puss in Boots, Alex, Shrek, Fiona, Po and many others. I loved the various DreamWorks Parades. Go up one deck for a better view. The Street Parties are crowded but energizing. There is so much to do onboard that if you are ever bored, it is not the cruise ship's fault. The advance reservation system worked very well for us. There were never problems with lines or mistakes. I thought that Amy Fickert our cruise director did a good job. The Navigational Aides near the banks of elevators are a terrific tool to help you find your way around the ship - even to your own cabin. They are easy to use and quite helpful. Look down on the elevator floor to keep track of the day of the week. All our shore Excursions with RCCL went well  we thought them worthwhile.
My negatives were few. In my stateroom I missed not having a retractable clothes line. The outlets were in an awkward place under the desk and hard to access. I disliked having to prepay my gratuities just because I chose My Time Dining. I also didnrsquo;t like having to pre-pay my Shore Excursions and Beverage Package. I rarely ate in the Windjammer because it was too difficult to balance beverage, salad, entrees and dessert without a tray. Instead we ate in the Solarium. I did appreciate staff members directing passengers to vacant tables and refilling beverage glasses and cups which was a nice touch. I loved the idea of a donut shop but I would like to see the quality of the donuts improved. The Royal Promenade was extremely crowded for special events and the wait for elevators could be long at peak times. In Labordee, I wish that there had been an RCCL Re.p onshore to direct us to our shore excursions. If there was one, we did see him/her. We also experienced a long final departure delay through no fault of the ship. Not enough inspectors showed up for work that day. 
All in all, The Oasis of the Seas is a great ship for newlyweds, young singles/couples, families and kids. I don't fall into any of those categories, though and I still had a fabulous time. If you love to meet people from all over the world, you will love this ship. Unexpectedly, we met dear friends on this ship that we didn't know were taking this sailing. How funny to run right into them in Central Park. Now, I would love to cruise on the sister ship, The Allure of the Seas for a slightly different experience."
5.0	Sail Date: Sep 01, 2012 /	"Simply put, the RC Oasis of the Seas is a nautical engineering marvel!  By far the roomiest ship out there, we never felt \""crowded\"" the whole time we were on board.  It dwarfed the 2 Carnival ships parked next to it in one of the ports we visited.  Not surprising that it was the smoothest cruise we've ever had!  The activities were fun and varied.  The staff went out of their way to be courteous and caring.  This was the best all-around cruise we've ever been on."
4.0	Sail Date: Sep 01, 2012 /	great ship, large, get a balcony on starboard side as they dock on this side all three stops. promenade is great and lots of sales throughout week. new menu on royal carribean now and waiters didnt know anything about the new food on menus. food was good, but not exceptional in my catagory. activities were good like zipline and flow rider. didnt see the officers as much like other ships. merry go round is something different and the water diving show is cool. didnt like not seeing shows every night due to having to get reservations. never saw ice skating rink. overall a good time.
1.0	Sail Date: Sep 01, 2012 /	The only reason to go is to be on the largest ship of its type. There is no other draw here. Staff is overworked and unhappy vs other RCCL crew. The shows are underwhelming, the food isn't great. The entire schedule of events is, after 3 yrs now, a disorganized wreck. You need to go all over the ship for show bookings, excursions, and other guest services, there is no one stop shop. Worst-cruise-ever. All they want to do on this ship is sell you stuff, pushy at it. Disembarking had guests screaming mad, they treat you like a herd of spent cattle. DO NOT GO.
4.7	Sail Date: Aug 18, 2012 /	This was my first Royal experience, and I've been hooked ever since. There is absolutely nothing negative I could possibly say. Simply amazing. From start to finish, port to venue and excursion to stateroom... had me at hello. I only wish everyone has such an experience.
3.0	Sail Date: Aug 01, 2012 /	"not that special.  not that new looking in design considering that its a brand new ship. there was a line everywhere and finding a table at the their windjammer cafe was always impossible. food was poor and restaurant choices were limited to none. never even bothered with the specialty restaurants. 
staff: cruise director Amy is amazing with all her energy BUT her staff members - mostly eastern european were NOT FRIENDLY, but rather RUDE and don't know how to interact with the customers.
Line to disembark was ridiculous!!
Basically, if you want to stand in line for everything, then this is the ship to go:("
5.0	Sail Date: Jul 01, 2012 /	My husband and I cruised on the Oasis of the Seas for our honeymoon. After going on 4 previous cruises with Royal Caribbean, this was by far the best experience. The ship itself is breathtaking! It was hard to believe the imagination and igenuity that were put into the creation of this vessel--there is an actual park in the middle of the ship, with live plants!!! If you are into specialty restaurants, it is defintely worth checking out other food options (for a fee). Otherwise, the free food is pretty good, except for the Windjammer Cafe which we detested. Beyond that, the entertainment is fantastic and our cruise director, Ken, was amazing (just be sure to book entertainment before the cruise OR on the 1st day since the popular shows sell out fast). The ports of call were all beautiful, but expensive. Honestly, we enjoyed the ship more than the destinations, but that's because we love to be on the water..And, we were lucky to have fairly calm seas. Overall, this was a great value for our money and we cannot wait to sail again with RC!!!
5.0	Sail Date: Jun 01, 2012 /	This was our very first cruise ever and the best!  We were nervous because all the reviews were mixed.  Again, the best experience EVER!  There is so much to do on this ship. The cruise director, Ricky makes the ship! He is all over the ship keeping everyone informed of all the activities.  We vacation a lot and this was a great experience. Great memories!
5.0	Sail Date: Jun 01, 2012 /	"We were on ""Oasis of the Seas"" for our 30th wedding anniversary.  Everything was very clean - staff always willing to help/friendly.  I have been having ""cruise withdrawals"" since we have been back."
5.0	Sail Date: Jun 01, 2012 /	This was our first family cruise and after being on the biggest ship in the sea I don't think we could go on any other ship! This cruise was outstanding! Plenty of places to eat, drink, and relax. The staff bends over backwards for customers and they are very friendly and helpful.  The ship is so big that it takes a day or two to know where you are but once you are familiar with your surroundings you can get to where you want to go quickly. The staterooms are very clean and updated. The balacony room we had looked over Central Park, which was awesome!
5.0	Sail Date: Jun 01, 2012 /	We went back to our cabin and unpacked, then went to the liquor tasting, which was a dud. I was expecting scotch or something decent but they were pouring some cream liquer that had no allure.  We got on the rising tide bar, had a great conversation with the waiter and a member of the cruise entertainment staff and really enjoyed a lichee martini as we went up and down. I expected a line but we were the only ones on the lift as it rose and fell.  After that, we returned to the Windjammer for a really fantastic casual dinner, healthy for me, and lots of naughty stuff for my partner. Great food, really fresh, plenty of tables open, boring desserts.

5.0	Sail Date: Jun 01, 2012 /	I Am 15 years old and I have been on 27 cruises. My last vacation on the Oasis of the Seas was exceptional. Everything was wonderful; the teen club staff, the waiters, the cleaning attendants, the state room, and the Flowrider staff. I had the time of my life on that cruise and tomorrow I'm going on the Oasis again, traveling the Eastern Caribbean and am looking forward to it more than anything. I would most definitely recommend this cruise to anyone I know, especially if they have teens.
5.0	Sail Date: Jun 01, 2012 /	"This cruise cannot be put into words, we have been cruising for years and kept saying to ourselves are you sure we are on a ship?
Throughout the cruise, we never felt any rocking or swaying of any kind.
Every member of the crew was extremely happy and pleasant, down to  the guys painting the railings.
I would highly recommend this cruise.
PS:  The cruise we took broke the record for people on board, but you would never know it."
5.0	Sail Date: Jun 01, 2012 /	Taking this cruise allows you to do so much but also have time for not doing anything. The ship was full of things to do and we got to be apart of a world movie premier on the ship, Madagascar. They had the full cast dressed up and dancing around the movie theater also it was in 3D.
5.0	Sail Date: Jun 01, 2012 /	The ship is huge and had a great variety of things to do and places to eat/relax. The ship is beautiful overall. Despite the large crowds things moved well. We rarely waited long for an elevator.
4.0	Sail Date: Jun 01, 2012 /	I Think sailing on it for the first time was like going to Disneyland.  I was in constant ahh.
5.0	Sail Date: May 19, 2012 /	"It was the Best a lot of fun

3.0	Sail Date: May 01, 2012 /	The layout of the ship was amazing.  They truly took their time with the design process in putting this one together.
5.0	Sail Date: Apr 28, 2012 /	"p
	This ship is unlike any other I have ever been on. I#39;ve been on Carnival#39;s biggest ship, the Dream, and it isn#39;t even close.
p
	It isn#39;t the size of the ship alone that is so amazing -- it is the quality of the experience. The entertainment was fabulous (17 meter high dives? Ice show with all sorts of lifts, flips and throws? Flying trapeze? Amazing.
p
	The ship is just classy. Nicer than any Royal Caribbean ship I have ever been on."
4.0	Sail Date: Apr 01, 2012 /	It is a great ship and has many amenities to satisfy everyone.
4.0	Sail Date: Apr 01, 2012 /	This was a high quality ship with lots to offer. Don't worry about finding stuff to do on the ship - computerized tvs are everywhere & you push a button & it gives you options - from what to do & where to eat. Don't bother with casino - so little bonuses/payouts that everyone was DISGUSTED. Took fun right out of it. Sunblock spf 50 at least (SEVERE burns were very common on our cruise.) Excursions were better booked in port. Watch the time - we left a few travelers on an island...
5.0	Sail Date: Apr 01, 2012 /	Lots of activities and fun for all.
5.0	Sail Date: Apr 01, 2012 /	The children loved the children's programs.
5.0	Sail Date: Apr 01, 2012 /	Breakfast in the dining room was like being in kindergarten.
5.0	Sail Date: Apr 01, 2012 /	"i went thinking it would not be smooth...it was.  its our 43rd cruise & probably the smoothest we havel ever been on.
it is a huge ship.  i would suggest going when school holidays aren't on the schedule...it can have over 1,000+ kids on board!
the service was outstanding.  another great surprise.
i wouldn't go again as we've been to all the Caribbean ports but i would recommend it for folks who still have islands on their bucket list!"
5.0	Sail Date: Apr 01, 2012 /	Awesome, food, service, staterooms. Just wonderful
5.0	Sail Date: Mar 01, 2012 /	It's a giant ship, and is maintained very clean.  The design of the ship is thoughtful, the TV guidance system really helps to find whereabout
3.0	Sail Date: Mar 01, 2012 /	"The over all of the ship was very nice, But better think again about cruising in march. We went and I think it must have been spring break!! way to many KIDS !!! they were everywhere, and I mean everywhere. ages from 5 to 13 not college !! and the cruise line charges for everything and I mean everything. When you book a cruise you think the food is included ""Guess Again"" Cupcakes -reastaurants ect.. had charges for everything you looked at. and the will push drinks all day and night !! felt like you were at a time share presentation. and did I mention the Kids haaaa I would have thought it was a Carnival Cruise. Not a relaxing cruise at all. and with 8 elevators you will still wait at everything you want to do. and watch when you sign for a drink the tip is added automaticly then they ask for another on the same bill--then they want you to tip at the end also."
3.0	Sail Date: Mar 01, 2012 /	i found the cruise to be very relaxing. our mistake was that we didn't realize that it was spring break for other parts of the country and there was just too many kids to my liking. the food was ok. we've been on other cruises and found that the food on this cruise didn't meet our expectations.
4.0	Sail Date: Feb 01, 2012 /	what a treat vacationing in the city one day and the next feeling like being at the atlantic city boardwalk . never fell like on the sea unless looking out on ocean view window or balcony.
5.0	Sail Date: Feb 01, 2012 /	I was amazed at how efficiently the ship operated.  The staff, every one of them was amazingly helpful and full of smiles!!  As many people that were on the ship, it never quite felt like it.  I can't wait to go back!!  Plenty to do on this one!!  If your bored on this cruise, it's your own fault!!  Activities all day and night!!  Casino is generous!!!
5.0	Sail Date: Feb 01, 2012 /	Oasis of the Seas is beyond an amazing ship!
4.0	Sail Date: Jan 01, 2012 /	Loved Central Park area, our balcony overlooked it and I think it was better than oceanview. Needed more stores, too many just geared towards kids. But, for safety issues the life jackets should be more readily available, none in the cabins, I think that is a big mistake.
5.0	Sail Date: Jan 01, 2012 /	It was our best Cruise ever. The Ship was everything they said it would be & more. Food & Service was great! Getting off & on the ship at the ports was very easy. The only complain I have is getting off the ship at the end of the trip. It was so terrible it ruin our feelings for the whole cruise.. The procedure for leaving the ship in Ft. Lauderdale was very bad. The Oasis personnel blamed the Customs Service which was very bad, but the Oasis did a very bad job of informing the people what was going on. They seemed more interested in getting the ship ready for the next sailing then how or when we could get off.the ship.. They need to improve the departure from the ship at Ft. Lauderdale or they are going to loose customers.
4.0	Sail Date: Dec 10, 2011 /	Enjoyed the ship fine. Too many people and hated the private island compared to holland americas. Would try a better itinerary with RC as the ship was nice and new, but room was small and staff was better on HAL, food better on HAL. Private island very much better on HAL. So overall think we will stick to HAL.
5.0	Sail Date: Dec 01, 2011 /	Great Ship
5.0	Sail Date: Nov 01, 2011 /	The Oasis of the Sea is the way to sail!  It is a moving city.  This was my very first cruise and I would go again in an instant.
3.0	Sail Date: Nov 01, 2011 /	Seas were rough out of FT.Lauderdale. its was really crowded 6,000 people on one ship they cant give you the service or quality that you may have experienced in the past. The food over all was 2 stars. The staff was great. Good shows, lots to do. The ports left a lot to be desired, small booths with junk to sell. The on board shops were a little over priced and the $10.00 per inch for gold plated chains were not a great deal. The wost experience was the ripoff art gallery selling lithographs as original paintings. Stay away, I owned Art galleries in the past the art was a ripoff, over priced and too many things wrong with what is supposed to be real art. The Attorney general needs to look into their practices.
4.0	Sail Date: Oct 08, 2011 /	I had a great time on the ship, however it was a little too large for me. Great amount of things to do onboard, however you will need to pre book most activities. Great for families of small children, not so great if you are looking to completely relax.
5.0	Sail Date: Oct 01, 2011 /	Beautiful - wonderful shows and really good food.  Cannot wait to cruise Oasis of the Seas AGAIN.
5.0	Sail Date: Oct 01, 2011 /	very organized
5.0	Sail Date: Oct 01, 2011 /	It was one of the most relaxing vacations we have ever experienced.
3.0	Sail Date: Oct 01, 2011 /	CRUISED 10/1/11.   RECOMMEND SHIP...NOT STOPS AT ALL...VERY DISSAPOINTED
3.0	Sail Date: Sep 01, 2011 /	i read the other reviews i don't know where their coming from tell the truth, it wasn't that great!maybe its their first cruise!
5.0	Sail Date: Aug 01, 2011 /	Had such a wonderful trip.  Always something to do.  Been on all kinds of different ships by different companies and this one is top notch.
4.0	Sail Date: Jul 01, 2011 /	It was more than I expected.  The layout, cleanliness and all of the areas available to the passengers. Can't wait 'til our next trip in August.
5.0	Sail Date: Jun 25, 2011 /	"OASIS June 25 2011

	A little about Us; we are a family of 4. Me, my husband, Daughter (22) and Son (18). We booked this back in the beginning of 2010. This was our 12th ( the kids 10th or 11th) cruise. Most of our cruises we have left from the NY/NJ area leaving the hassle of flying behind.

	DS chose Oasis for his HS Graduation celebration cruise, so off we go to Ft Lauderdale. We flew in the day before and I made plans to see my friend aka ldquo;Birthday Sisterrdquo; who I hadn't seen in 30 yrs. We stayed at the Ft Lauderdale Cruise Port Hotel- a $17 taxi ride from the airport, very nice hotel and a 2 minute ride to the port (Port Everglades). We made arrangements at the hotel for a taxi ($6.00pp and DH gave them a $5 or $10 tip) to the port. We also booked them to take us to the Courtyard Marriot on our return (we booked a room for the day since our flight home wasn't until 5:30pm). DH called them when we disembarked and they were there in 2 minutes.

	DH and I stayed in a D1 (10198, a balcony hump-cabin) and our kids stayed across the hall in a C2 (10197, a Central Park balcony). Both cabins were excellent. Our D1 balcony had a table and 3 chairs. The table is so much better then a short and small side table we're accustomed to on the Voyager class.

	Embarkation couldn't be smoother; we were on board by 11:30. (yeah, okay maybe I should mention this... I remove my belt- take off my shoes, do everything Im asked. Not concealing or smuggling anything, but there I am setting off the alarms, and yes I had to be wanded)

	We checked on our cabin at noon and since our cabin attendant was finished he let us in. We left our carry-ons behind, locked the door and were off exploring. We stopped in to look at Cup Cakes on the Promenade!

	We stopped in to IZUMI to change our reservation time and to make sure they could accommodate preparing our sushi rolls using soy paper. When I saw a picture posted on a thread here on cc (a few weeks back) of Izumi I had commented that I thought the decor could have been more reflective of Asian style- I take that comment back, lol I do believe Izumi has great asian style and decor and affords the perfect vibe.

	Oasis Boardwalk  Central Park, first impression, love it- but wouldnt miss it. Agreed, pretty innovative.

	Although Oasis is huge, we found it very easy to navigate. It never seemed a far walk anywhere. Maybe it was the mid ship location of our cabins.There were times the ship seemed crowded and times it didnt.

	We made it to Johnny Rockets for breakfast twice, but passed on it for lunch. Park Cafe became a favorite almost immediately. the roast beef sandwiches, panninis, soup were all very good. The Salad was my favorite. Always crowded, but we were always able to get a table. Tables are also very close together. Between indoor and outdoor seating the tables turned pretty quickly. The flavored water, okay, the Mango flavored water is really good. I didnt taste the others. Ask if the breakfast Egg Paninni has pesto if you are allergic to nuts. It did when we were on board. I thought it was actually a wonderful twist on an egg sandwich served on pannini. But if you are allergic to nuts, this is a breakfast dish one would never think has nuts.One of my favorite breakfasts was a [sesame] bagel with a roasted garlic and sun dried tomato cream cheese and lox.

	Viking Crown Lounge was another embarkation day pit stop for us. The ONLY indoor Bar and Lounge with a view to the sea. (I recommend a Pear Melon Martini)

	We chose My Time Dining (MTD) for this cruise. We have always gone traditional-late seating and although I prefer that over early/main I still always wished there could be a compromise. I want to start dining at 7:30 every evening! Voila, MTD showed up on board RCI ships. Although available on our Dec 2010 14 night holiday cruise, we still opted for late. This time around, going on Oasis and having to prebook your shows and entertainment, it forced us into trying MTD.

	The first night of MTD is not organized. There are 2 lines and both pax with and without reservations wait on either line. We waited around 15 minutes (I was not patient at the beginning and wanted to know why there werenrsquo;t separate lines. This is so where DH and I complement each other, he is calm, cool and collected- Me, not so much. This all changes the second night and there are separate lines and MTD runs fabulously!) We were first being shown to a table in an area at the far back that I didnrsquo;t like. Before he even got us to the table, I expressed how that wouldnrsquo;t work, we turned to a table for four that overlooked the deck below and asked if that would work and we were happily seated there for the rest of the cruise ndash; with the same wait staff, and at the same time (except for the nights we went to Izumi and Chops). MTD for us was the best experience ever!

	I can add here, after reading a few reviews prior to this sail that said the MDR food was only so-so, I had no expectations of anything but not-so-good fare. Boy was I surprised. The food in the MDR during MTD for us was way beyond good. I wont say excellent, but totally surprised it was so very, very good.
	
	Unlike my last review where I posted pictures of every plate of food that graced our table of 6, along with a post-it note hand written description, this time the food porn is sporadic. [NOTE: pictures not included in this posting]

	The first evening we had reservations for Oasis of Dreams, where, no pun intended, it rained on our parade.We all enjoyed the show, despite the rain and having to exit and take cover. My daughter and I being somewhat more critical of the performance thought the synchronization was off and the majority was more a gymnastics program rather then a dive show. Well, we could have been mistaken, because we were expecting more of a dive show. We did love the diving at the end. Okay, my daughter and I were just picking it apart, it was truly wonderful and very, very enjoyable! Everyone seeing this show will enjoy it. Loved the Red Bull divers. Make reservations, arrive at least 30 minutes prior to show time- and try to get the comfy chairs or you will be sitting on the benches.

	Day one- we could not get the cabin water to cool. (Day 2 we immediately called Guest services and it was fixed)

	The cabin - - as mentioned in many other reviews and live threads, the outlets are located under the ever-so-tiny desk area. This was an epic fail, but I heard it was corrected on Allure. Also, we felt there was not enough storage at all - and, the safe shrunk! How can it hold your valuables if it is getting smaller? It didn't affect us, we had a laptop lock for the laptop and locked other stuff in a suitcase. Also, no pullout clothesline in the shower.

	Ah, my favorite, our first day at sea!

	DH and I had breakfast at Johnny Rockets. I had scrambled eggs (which are the same as on windjamer buffet or if they are ordered in the MDR, they are not fresh eggs scrambled to order), My husband had over easy. Nothing to elaborate on. My daughter and I checked out the Coach, (to my surprise) they had a very nice selection.

	My daughter and I shared 2 cupcakes the entire cruise. The Red Velvet with cream cheese frosting and an Apple Pie cupcake with a sweet cream and cinnamon frosting - both were very good.

	Sorrentors; the busiest place on the promenade when folks return from excursions.

	Formal Nights on Board Oasis:
	
	Very nice. Folks seemed to all look fab. There are obvious folks in shorts and beachwear, but didn't see that in the MDR. Actually, there was one table not far from us, sorry to say they were looked at - so if you wear shorts, sneakers, tee shirts, yes you will probably stand out in the MDR on formal night as this was the definite minority.

	Most nights everyone looked really nice.

	Hairspray was AMAZING. Make your reservations online before you leave - make sure you dont miss it.

     Labadee. We all did the zip line in December, this time we voted to just chill on the beach. We took a one way ferry from Oasis over to the Columbus cove area. This was not available when we were on Explorer this past December, we surmise they only use it when Oasis and Allure docks (because of the amount of pax). We tipped ($10.00/ 4 chairs) one of the rci locals who helped us with lounge chairs and finding us an area. The buffet lines were long this time.We took the tram back to the pier. We chose not to walk through the markets, so I can't comment on whether they are aggressive or not. Here are some pictures, (they're not so great, we were moving and I took them with my Olympus indestructible water camera)

	How come I never heard it mentioned, there is an escalator on Oasis. Plus, you let yourself back in. Instead of handing your seapass for them to account for you, you slide it in yourself.There was a line for the ferry as soon as we disembarked on the pier at Labadee. Since this ferry wasn't available on our last cruise (explorer) we're surmising that it is used for the Oasis class ships. No clamshell canopy loungers on columbus cove beach, but plenty of shade from palm trees and smooth sand getting into the ocean.

	Helipad Champagne Sail Away from Labadee, By Invitation only. This was nice! Unless invited, you can not get to the helipad on Oasis. Im not sure whether it is a Diamond event or the invite went to all CA members.

	
	Everyone took pictures with King Julian, and the Hotel Director, he made a fabulous speech and the Master (blew) the horn a few times (even when a glass fell and broke, if I recall correctly, lol)

	IZUMI Tonight.emNom, nom, nom, nom, nom......I have to admit, I was quite impressed. We are admitted sushi-snobs, (if you didn't read earlier in this review, we stopped into izumi on boarding day to make sure they could prepare our sushi rolls with soy paper). While waiting a few minutes for our table at Izumi we strolled through the Windjammer. It seemed to be somewhat limited for our palates.While not Nobuor Morimotors, for me sushi on board has been long awaited for. Izumi proved to be very good. Everything tasted yummy and delicious. I like that on the Oasis Class shipsEdamame and Miso soup are complimentary . My daughter had the Noodle Bowl which is equivelent to Yaki Udon. My son had the beef hot rock and enjoyed it thouroughly. My husband and I tried all the rolls. I liked them all. I thought the Box Roll was great.

	Oh Jamaica! I actually love Jamaica. I know, I know some of you hate it, but we have always had pretty good experiences. This was our 3rd time to Jamaica, but (obviously) the first time our ship called on Falmouth. We usually wing it either rent a jeep or hire a private tour guide, it depends on the island. As we were looking into all inclusive places close to Falmouth, my husband came home from his office and said he spoke to an associate who just spent a week at Iberostara Rose Hall and recommended it. Other then Oasis- the Ship, this was the highlight of the cruise and our excursions. Wow, I dont often land vacation but I want to book a get away here right away--Falmouth is going to be a fantastic port. I bought Blue Mountain coffee and jerk spices. Within the market area, all the vendors were pleasant and friendly. There was absolutely no one trying to get you to buy their wares. There was no soliciting of any kind. Also, you will find a Taxi Rate Sheet small billboard that tells you the set prices to different locations. We didnt need to take towels with us to the Iberostar suites in Jamaica, they provide them for the day. The cost for the day was $75pp, and the cost of a taxi for the 4 of us was [as seen in the picture of taxi rates] - $40 each way. There are taxis waiting at Iberostar to take you back to the pier, so dont worry about contracting your first driver to pick you up at a specified time to return to the ship.

	Uh Oh, I didnt mention that the candy shack should really offer maybe just one thing in DARK CHOCOLATE? For those of us who stopped eating milk chocolate and would like something a little decadent, like dark chocolate.

	The Diamond Lounge is fantastic! The folks there (Charmaine and umm, I forgot) were wonderful! It was never crowded. On this cruise, children were not allowed. Since, the policy has changed.

A side note on the towel situation/em/strong.Of course, I admit it didnt affect me much because I have a special husband who takes care of these type of things while I chill.
	
	The majority of the time there was between 1 and 2 towel stations opened and staffed on the entire pool deck. Only one sea day did we see a towel station in the Solarium staffed. This made it annoying for those of us situating ourselves in the Solarium. To make matters worse, when my husband trekked from the Solarium across to the opposite end of the pool deck, there was only one station staffed with 2 but half a dozen bar servers just standing around- it was a port day late afternoon. As expressed to RCI, we understand the towel situation and the need for this process, but they need to step it up and provide us, the passengers with staffed stations, so it doesn't take time out of our vacation.

	In 11 cruises, oura href=http://boards.cruisecritic.com/showthread.php?t=1439785page=7food/ain the MDR was THE BEST we have had yet........ You know what, we were very happily surprised.I wonder what makes a dining experience on the same cruise so totally different. We had EXCELLENT wait staff - and, the head waiters were at our table twice a night. They loved us. Everything we ordered came out as it should, not overcooked or undercooked. The only issue we had was one morning with eggs benedict in the MDR - they are ALWAYS hit or miss and if you dont know how they are supposed to be prepared and served, well you just wouldn#39;t know the difference. We went to Chops one evening (4 of us) and Izumi once for dinner and once for lunch.

	Right before we were leaving on this cruise, there was some bragging about the Lasagna on board Oasis. This left me awfully curious, so we all ordered it. It was ok- if you're Italian you'd expect a lot more. The white sauce on top is just that, a simple white sauce. Come on Royal, this dish needs some cheese! Lasagna must have cheese, not white sauce (poor attempt of a beacute;chamel). My time Dining worked wonderfully for us.
	I think a big reason MTD worked so well for us is because I explained how i wanted it to work for us and I didnt leave it to fate, lol. We explained that we have cruised before and always had traditional late seating, and trying MTD was new to us- and we made our reservations for every night online and would like the same table and same wait staff every night. They graciously accommodated us and it was wonderful to have dinner 7:30 every night with the same staff.
	
	I do admit that on the first night it seemed like it was going to be a free for all, but the second night there were separate lines and we never waited more then a few minutes, if at all.
	
	On a side note: As we stroll to Schooner one day we pass the loyalty ambassador, who tried to stuff a banana peel into the box outside the loyalty ambassador desk? A picture is worth a thousand words. [I will have to post it in the picture section]

	I was asked, ""So, did you love Oasis?"" I answered with this: Let me say, yes and no. I think LOVE is too strong a word. I didnt love her basically because other then my balcony or when you're at one of the pool decks, you dont feel like you are at sea. Everything feels like it is indoors. It was raining when we had reservations at Chops and I didnt like having to get wet.Note: there are umbrellas out when it rains- but they are situated in front of the CP Restaurants. If you are coming out of Chops or 150 Park, its great- you just grab an umbrella...but if you are coming from your stateroom, from an inside elevator and it just starts raining, you are out of luck. Plus it gets slippery out there in the rain so a lady in heels is out of luck trying to even speed up the pace, lol. My husband noticed umbrellas outside of 150 I think it was and grabbed one and walked me to Chops.Would I sail on her again? Yes, for the right price and situation.

	Dont forget to check your stateroom television to check your seapass balance. The ice show was very good.Not as long as the ones we have seen on Explorer, but still a fabulous show not to be missed!! The skaters were outstanding! I almost forgot, the most amazing part of the ice show was the sand art artist, it was amazing to watch. [This is not mine, but I found this clip on youtube. If you havent seen it, its really great.

	I read everything I could about Nachi Cocom, Mr Sanchos, Paradise something-or-other. For me it was a toss between Nachi and Mr. Sanchos. I was leaning towards a peaceful and chill type of day. We bring our own music, so we didn#39;t need loud music playing overhead. After reading 99% excellent reviews and seeing wonderful pictures we booked Nachi. We took a cab there ($17 and DH gave the driver $20)

	When you arrive, you are greeted by a girl who takes your picture wearing huge sombreros. We purchased the picture, it is 12.00. Initially Nachi Cocom looks great and the service seems to be impeccable; Manuel kept coming over to us to see if we needed more drinks. This was a huge issue, there seemed to be NO alcohol in their alcohol- seriously. If you are a beer drinker then Nachi can work for you. The other issue was the water. The ocean was not beautiful, it was not clear. It was cloudy and the weather the days before were calm. Because of these two issues it makes me also say that the beach should have been raked that morning, before cruise guests arrived.There are plenty of palapas and it is beautiful. The ocean was the big disappointment. Another family that was at Nachi from a CCL cruise said him and his wife had been there a few years prior, and since the beach lost about 15#39;- and he had promised his little ones beautiful blue water and it wasn't!
	After reading everything online positive, then seeing the ocean, then the worst then anywhere bad drinks, the average food couldn't make up for it. I don't like returning with a bad review, but I had to give the facts as they were to us. On our return to the ship, my husband asked the driver (we knew what he was going to say tho) but we asked the driver what he thought were the best beach/beaches to visit in Cozumel when here for a day on a cruise..of course he said Nachi cocom, then we asked where else and he said Mr Sanchos. I cant even offer any advice on where since the driver's dedication apparently lies with these beach club owners. We had yummy guacamole and chips, average chicken wings, really really good salsa. the chicken fajitas and the grilled shrimp, but they were nothing different then I would make my family for dinner at home. My son liked his ribs and my daughter was annoyed that inside those yummy looking enchiladas (?) was some shredded chicken and no cheese.

	Leaving Cozumel......
	
	Our kids went back to the ship to shower and change and then went back out to Senor Frogs. We walked around a bit. I bought vanilla and a small colorful pottery frog for a spot in my front garden.
	Lots of yummy leather boots. I didn't know this, if I did I would have planned to buy boots. Beware of all the knock off bags that infringe on the copyrights of designers, don't get sucked in to thinking they are authentic.
	When DH and I went through the scanners leaving Cozumel, his Oakleys never came out. If we had to ask over and over at least 4 or 5x for them to look at their scanners to see where my husbands sunglasses were. They never came out. It wasn't like we weren't watching and someone could have picked them up. They did not come out of the scanner and it seemed like they didn't care and weren't going to do anything until we insisted. It was the oddest few minutes there. DHs sunglasses did get caught up somehow inside the scanner. I kept telling my husband I was glad we weren't trashed like the girl in front of us because I can be honest in saying that I would have never realized the sunglasses didnt come out of the scanner!

	We went to Chops tonight. It was raining and we had to walk from the elevators/entrance to Central Park to Chops in the rain. Its tough to quicken your pace in heels because its a little slippery. A great idea but it needs to be perfected is there are huge umbrellas located outside the restaurants in Central Park-they really need to be located by the elevators as well (or the entrances to CP).Dinner was excellent. [the Tuna appetizer was phenomenal]

	The Quest....
	The Quest game show was very different comparatively to what we have seen and participated in on Explorer. LOVED IT! There was just so much [additional] improv going on that it lasted over 1.5 hrs. We start off in one section, we're 6 people. Our section seems dull. We notice a pretty wild section, so we quickly join them. One couple was the newlywed [game] couple from the DC area. DD quickly gets onto the dance floor and starts dancing, this secures her as a co-captain. Another guy who is getting the section pumped is the other captain. We had a great team!Oasis has a resident Disc Jockey as well as a DJ Scratch academy DJ. The resident DJ is a part of Quest along with the Cruise director.

	The Solarium was a favorite spot of ours on sea days. We also very much enjoyed the Diamond Lounge.

	And thenhellip;.it was time to go home.

	[While writing this review, RCI called our home office. *Just off the phone with RCI representative, Pamela. My husband and I conferenced in together when she called. She wanted to know if we had anything more to elaborate on from the comment card we filled out. It was a pleasure to receive this phone call and be able to discuss the few minor faults (ie: D1 fail of outlet placement)emas well as recommendations/em(I think the Solarium age should be 18 and up. Nothing personal to under 18s, but age restriction should match across the board. 17  under can not go into the night clubs, they have their own- It would be less confusing if the Solarium mimicked the same restriction) I think kids deserve to act their age and there is nothing wrong with safe horseplay in a pool, just not in the solarium pool. Welcoming 16yo's that are tumbling out of their lounge-space with 15 yos is just asking for rowdiness.) Okay, I said it and now I am done.) We also pointed out all the super-wonderful-amazing aspects of Oasis! We REALLY loved the layout  design of her! it is really very easy to navigate from one end to the other.]"
5.0	Sail Date: Jun 18, 2011 /	I was on this ship in June 2011. It was my first cruise and I wanted to be on the best ship - and it definitely was! Oasis did not disappoint, the food was incredible, the entertainment was endless and the staff was so friendly! It’s literally impossibly to be bored on this ship. Well done Royal Caribbean, I can’t wait to meet Harmony in April 2019!

	I was somewhat reluctant to try our first cruise, but at my husbandrsquo;s insistence I booked our trip aboard a href=http://www.lovecruise.co.uk/cruise-lines/royal-caribbean/oasis-of-the-seas title=Royal Caribbean Oasis of the SeasRoyal Caribbean Oasis of the Seas/a. Well, he definitely gets to say ldquo;I told you so!rdquo; The trip was one of our family favorites, and we are definitely looking forward to our next cruise.
p
	Since we were traveling with 2 children, my biggest concern was that one boat couldnrsquo;t be enough to entertain them for a week. Donrsquo;t worry on that frontndash;if anything, there wasnrsquo;t enough time to fit everything in! The ship was perfect for young childrenndash;our boys are 6 and 9, and the arcade alone would have kept them happy the whole time. The staff were great with the kids, and had activities planned like art projects, theater games, and scavenger hunts. I was pleasantly surprised that they managed to sneak a little learning in each dayndash;it was great to know that the boys knew where we were traveling, and could point it out on a map. They joined the late night party for kids once, which was so wonderful for my husband and I. A night out is a treat for us!
p
	There was a live performance of Hairspray on board and it felt like we were treated to a show on Broadway! I couldnrsquo;t believe something this professional was aboard the ship. We didnrsquo;t have time to fit in a night at the comedy club or a the jazz performances, but friends aboard Oasis of the Seas said it was wonderfulndash;we will definitely have to schedule it for our next cruise. The boys loved eating at Johnny Rocketsndash;make sure you eat there at least once when yoursquo;re on board. We also had a few meals at Sorrentorsquo;s, which was a nice pizza place. Windjammer had a big buffet full of more traditional foods, which was great when the boys were hungry and needed to eat straight away. The main dining room was my favorite, and we took advantage of the ldquo;My Family Diningrdquo; option so that the boys ate first and quickly, and then were picked up by staff to go to the Adventure Ocean area. They were happy to eat quickly and then go play, and my husband I are were so pleased to be able to relax and enjoy an ldquo;adultrdquo; meal with a few drinks at a more leisurely pace. Sign up in advance for this service, you will be so glad you did!

5.0	Sail Date: May 01, 2011 /	"Months before getting in the ship their website help us plan activities that the ship provided. When we got there everything was nice and smooth. There was no complication at the time of check in, our bags where taking care of the staff of Royal Caribbean (they get your bags and tag them and take them to the ship and at the end they start they speech of ""you don't have to but tips are appreciated :/ ) The entrance is amazing, they have hand sanitizer before you get in the ship (5 stars.) They also have it at the entrance of every food station. Every hour they have MANY activities. At night there is always something to do. Different clubs for all kind of styles, like 4 or 5. They have the Latin club, all kinds of music club, jazz club, top songs club, and a classic music station. Food is free almost every where you go. Fast food and healthy food. If you do the MY TIME DINING it is  soooo worth it, is chefs food and FREE. Tipping is cheap at the cruse. You only tip 4 people and they (Royal Caribbean) suggest you to tip a min of $3.75-$3.96 (something like that) per day. Everything that you do, eat, get is not really what you are paying for. Is so cheap. You can't say is expensive after being pamper for so many days, the make you feel like royalty. I DEFINITELY recommended."

5.0	Sail Date: May 01, 2011 /	It was a great ship with alot to offer,  if you do not like to walk this is not the ship for you.  I just kills me when I hear complaining about the size,  we all know it is one huge ship so be prepared to walk on the bright side of that walking is very good for you.  The staff is wonderful help if you need any.

5.0	Sail Date: Apr 09, 2011 /	Oasis class is the best class. So many places to explore and never feeling crowded. Central Park is one of our faverate areas. Where else can you be in a park in the middle of the ocean.
5.0	Sail Date: Apr 02, 2011 /	Cannot say enough about this ship.  It was truly spectacular!  The restaurants were great, the cabins were all new and very clean.  Also enjoyed all the amenities.
4.0	Sail Date: Apr 01, 2011 /	The Oasis of the Seas is a BIG ship with wonderful amenities, service, entertainment and food.
5.0	Sail Date: Apr 01, 2011 /	This was our first cruise and it was wonderful. Check in was so easy as was departure. Food was excellent, great variety and outstanding service. Everyone was very helpful and courtious. There was plenty to do and the shows were the highlight of the trip. We could not believe how clean everything was all the time. Royal Caribbean knows how to run a cruise line.
3.0	Sail Date: Apr 01, 2011 /	The ship  itself was wonderful.  Be prepared to miss the shows, deal with LONG waits in getting off and back on the ship.  The embarkment was really terrible.  The scanned each and every bag.  So this made you think twice about getting off the ship.  Oh, if you think your going to enjoy a hot steam room visit, forget it.  Unless you pay an arm and a leg,  you will not get to relax in the steam room after a hard work out.  A ship this large, you will loose a lot of personable feeling and you will spend a lot of time waiting and standing in line.   Therefore, with the prices of these tickets, it was a little disappointing.
5.0	Sail Date: Mar 01, 2011 /	Was nervous that we'd get swallowed up, but Ship actually felt intimate.  There are countless restaurants, venues and clubs to find the exact mood you want.  And there's actually a gorgeous PARK to stroll at night, and busy indoor Promenade to party until the wee hours. The entertainment was 1st class, and you can book a different show every night.   This was great!
4.0	Sail Date: Mar 01, 2011 /	We have come to expect the superior level of service and comfort that RCCl always delivers. With more then 5200 guests, we NEVER waited in line for dinner or shows. However, the food in the main dining room was so substandard, that we chose to dine in the restuarants every night. Okay with us, but family's with children may find this prohibitive. Shows and entertainment were terrific. Although we tried, we couldn't do everything there was to do in a week. Highly recommend this ship and RCCL as whole. But they just have to get their restuarant quality to a higher standard.
4.0	Sail Date: Mar 01, 2011 /	Very impressed with the ship.
5.0	Sail Date: Feb 19, 2011 /	Oasis of the Seas docked next to me while I was on the carnival dream was a sight. It was that day I decided my next cruise had to be on that ship. When the day came, my jaw dropped to the shear size of this boat. It’s over double the size of any regular cruise ship. The neighborhood concept is amazing, and the open air design is breathtaking. Even though it is crowded, this ship delivers fun and exciting cruises for everyone. Booking this ship would not be a mistake!
5.0	Sail Date: Feb 01, 2011 /	"This ship was huge and we worried that would cause problems with waiting and quality. The staff is well trained in dealing woth ;ineups, etc. Everytime that there was a line developig (at dinner, at the shows, etc) teh staff jumped into GREAT SERVICE mode and helped move things along. Even for MyTime dining, we didn't wait more than 15 minutes.
My only concern was teh way many passengers arrived at 6:00 am to put towels on their sun-chairs and then left for 3 or 4 hours. They wer abusing the patient of the staff and other passengers"
5.0	Sail Date: Feb 01, 2011 /	This ship was amazing! There was not a day that I wasn't impressed by something on this vessel. The food was great, the entertainment was superb, and we even got to watch the Super Bowl on big screens complete with tailgating food. The only bad thing about this ship is that it will increase your cruise expectations. I highly recommend this ship to active people who want something to do at all times.
5.0	Sail Date: Feb 01, 2011 /	we have cruised 14 times on Royal Caribbean and 4 on another line we enjoy this line the best the dining staff were a little unorganized BUT its a new ship the waiter was only there 4 weeks and they had a lot of tables to serve and do you know what we were on holidays so who is in a hurry ...life and 1 weeks cruise goes too fast ,,,so enjoy we had a great gale Nancy on 10th floor was WONDERFUL and the best of all our cruises! before you cruise sign up for your shows it really helps ,then you don't have to stand in line.  the CRUISE DIRECTOR was the BEST WE HAVE HAD he really made the trip esp. his SOCKS (HE SHOWED THEM EVERYTIME he was on stage and were a differant pair ) and we can't forget MR.BUTCHER from costumer service !!!!!! well I could go on and on but I can say we will see you next year!!!
5.0	Sail Date: Feb 01, 2011 /	"All I can say is ""WOW"" really , Me and my family travel in a large ground and had the times of our lives ! We also went in the inagural season so prices were pretty darn high but it was sooooo worth it !"
5.0	Sail Date: Jan 01, 2011 /	Very family oriented with  a large selection of activities - would have liked the anytime dining to stay open later than 9:30 as my friend and I only made it to dinner twice due to the time.  Hard then to find areas to eat except pizza and sandwiches.  But overall a organized and beautiful ship!
3.0	Sail Date: Dec 01, 2010 /	"I spent 6 days of the Oasis of the seas.  I slept on the bed and 17 year old slept on the couch (I do not know why, he is 17)  He came back to Omaha with Bed bugs and the doctor said it was from the ship.  He did not complain until he got home (kids do that stuff).  I did not receive any bites since I slept on the bed.  My ex wife was very upset and had to take him to the doctor.    I called the cruise line and you can see their response.

I purchased medical insurance, too.

Everything else was great.

Mr. XXXXXXXXXX,   

I apologize about the delay in responding to you.   I was advised however that we would be unable to issue any sort of compensation for the bed bugs, because unfortunately we are unable to verify that your son received the bed bugs from the ship.   

I am still researching issue regarding the shore excursion refund.  As soon as I am able to advise you this information, I will. 

Again I apologize, but without verification from the ship which we did not receive I am unable to compensate. 

Thank you,

5.0	Sail Date: Dec 01, 2010 /	Well I started on this cruiseship which I think now is totally cheating because this ship is like NO OTHER,well except the Allure it's sister ship.Its two ships combined into one and right when you walk on to the ship your mouth is to the ground.They have a rising tide bar that lowers and rises ,it's more novelty but insane.Every level you get off is like another cruise.The Pool deck to this day is still the biggest pool deck I've ever been on,Huge jacuzzis that hang over the side of the ship.Nightly entertainment was as good as NYC shows.They have a Central Park cafe that I ate lunch almost every day.Royal has the nice class to its ship and things that are free don't come off cheap.I compare Royal Caribbean to a Nice Marriott or Hilton.Food at night was very good and menu changes every night.Service was great.Cant find a thing to complain about ,getting off and on takes a lil bit and elevator rides are longer waits but overall would do it again   .Oasis is the real deal!!
4.8	Sail Date: Nov 06, 2010 /	It was my first time and everything about it was beautiful! Departing, returning, the ports, . The staff, the people...what a fabulous time!
5.0	Sail Date: Nov 01, 2010 /	I chose this cruise because I was curious if Oasis of the Seas is indeed all that Royal Caribbean promise her to be - And it is. There are so many things to do onboard, that I started every day at 6am (jogging around the running course on deck 5) and was exhausted by the end of the day (my 7 years old son fell asleep every day at about 8:30pm after a long day of activities). A week is not enough time to do all the things that are offered onboard (I never got around to the climbing wall). The shows were wonderful, the gym and spa are excellent, there is definately too much food, and the staff is very helpfull and friendly.
3.0	Sail Date: Nov 01, 2010 /	I have sailed on 5 sailing in the past. I was less impressed with the quality of food served in the main dining area compared to other sailings. We ended up going to specialty restaurants to get finer food (about $180/night). I was displeased to see that a 15% gratuity is charged on any and every thing. I.E. I bought 2 cans of red bull on my way off the ship, it wasn't opened...just handed to me and was charged a gratuity LOL. I'm a very generous person in regards to tipping...WHEN it's deserved. Lastly, my MAJOR disappointment concerns gift certificates purchased from the Royal Caribbean website. As this was my honeymoon cruise, the cruise planner suggested that I have friends purchase gift certificates to be used as onboard credit (sounded like a great idea). I received 2 cerificates early and read in the terms and conditions to activate them. I was worried about what would happen when I received additional certificates one day prior to sailing. I called another cruise agent and they reassured me it would still be taken as onboard credit (I'm assuming it's noted that we were on our honeymoon is why an acception would be made). I received $600 in gift certificates as wedding gifts. Needless to say, guest services onboard the ship refused to take the certificates because they were not activated. I told her I just had a wedding reception and was given the certificates, we were on our honeymoon, etc...still refused to apply the credit. I was given a corporate number. I was extremely outraged. I can't figure out how such a critically important piece of information about activation could be missed TWICE in talking to their customer service agents. Apparently it's not so important to some. I was told to use it on a future cruise. I wrote to WRAL 5 news here in NC to make people aware about this nonsense. The hospital I'm employed with will also get a copy of the letter sent to the news team so that they will hopefully change their minds about future sailings with Royal Caribbean. At this point, it's all about the principle of the matter.
2.0	Sail Date: Nov 01, 2010 /	THE SHIP WAS TOO BIG,TOO MANY PEOPLE,BUFFET WAS NOT FRESH,LITTLE CHOICES,THE STORES DID NOT HAVE TYLENOL OR ANYTHING YOU MAY NEED,TOO MANY  DAYS AT SEA,WE WENT TO GIOVANIS FOR LUNCH WHICH IS A PAY FOR RESTAURAUNT AND IT WAS GROSS ITALIAN FOOD,TOO MANY PEOPLE ON THIS SHIP,THE PEOPLE THAT MADE THE CRUISE GOOD WAS OUR DINING ROOM WAITRESS MARICRISS AND HER ASSISTANT WAITER LEYDON,BUT ONE GOOD THING I CAN SAY THEY TOOK GOOD CARE OF THE CHILDREN ON THE SHIP AND THE CHILDREN ENJOYED THE CRUISE THE MOST.I WOULD NOT GO ON ROYAL CARRIBEAN AGAIN,THIS WAS MY SEVENTH CRUISE.THE SHIP WAS VERY CONFUSING TO GET AROUND.
5.0	Sail Date: Nov 01, 2010 /	it is a beautiful ship. I stayed in a balcony stateroom which was very spacious.
4.0	Sail Date: Oct 01, 2010 /	A great experience.
5.0	Sail Date: Sep 01, 2010 /	Our last Cruise with Royal Caribbean was with the Independence Of The Seas and we were very pleased with it.  But ever since the Oasis  was being built I just could not way to sail on it.   Finally we went on  the Oasis in September 2010.  Independence Of The Seas was beautiful, but Oasis Of The Seas is just absolutely stunning. The food, shows, entertainment, the lay out of the ship, decor, just amazing.  The service was top notch. Never felt lost on this large ship because of the large plasma TV they have all over the ship that guides you where you want to go, may it be for places to eat, see a show or find your favorite club.The Aqua Theater shows and movies were great. Hair spray and the Ice show were the best.  Just can't  stop dreaming about the next time we will cruise again on the Oasis.  (2011)
4.0	Sail Date: Sep 01, 2010 /	By far the best cruising experience we have ever had in 15 years.Main Dining Room food and service were fantastic ! The shows were above any of the 12 cruises we've been on. Pools offered great variety .Getting on and off the ship was extremely organized-- 10 minutes on and off  ! Some people complained about being shut out of the shows .If they reserved their times like they were told they would not have had any problem what so ever.
5.0	Sail Date: Aug 01, 2010 /	I was on the Liberty of the seas but the Oasis is amazing and so much to do with very little time
4.0	Sail Date: Jul 03, 2010 /	This was my first cruise. It spoiled cruising in some ways. I had to readjust my expectations. The ship is so big with so much to do that you can’t possibly do everything the first time. I wouldn’t say it’s better than smaller ships just different. Lots to do.
5.0	Sail Date: Jul 01, 2010 /	the room service is amzing. i love the food and the shows. they have amazing cleaning people and its fun to walk around the ship when your not even doing anything. it is so clean.
3.0	Sail Date: Jul 01, 2010 /	The ship is beautiful.  The staff had everything very organized for such a large amount of people. I would recommend the ship, but not the My Time Dining. This was a horrible concept and does not work!!!
3.0	Sail Date: Jul 01, 2010 /	Ship and crew great.  Food was not that good compared to other cruise ships.  Would never do the My Time Dining...Long waits...horrible service...and you get to pay gratuities up front, so what did they have to work for??? Very dissappointed in this.  Lines so long with reservations that my son refused to eat there!!!
5.0	Sail Date: Jun 01, 2010 /	Greatest cruise we have experienced.  Design of ship is fantastic.  Easy to get around.  Not as crowded as we thought it would be.  Our room with a balcony overlooking central park was great.
4.0	Sail Date: Jun 01, 2010 /	"The Oasis is the BEST so far that Royal Caribbean has made.  It is beautifully made and accessibility to every Deck was great for every age.  We had a great dinner group and Orlando our Waiter was always ready and willing.  Jesus Kahn our Stateroom Attendant is a gentleman, it felt like he was always cleaning our room.   We just loved the kids play areas so much that we are planning to take our 3 grandchildren next year.  The food was delicious, Royal Caribbean catered to almost every nation.  However,  I would like to see some Caribbean dishes the next time, eg. peas & rice,  oxtail stews and, stew chicken.  I recommend a Jamaican Chef for these dishes.  I am not from Jamaica and neither is my husband but have a caribbean background and enjoy the Caribbean flavors.   The Rising Bar was great, we have never seen anything of its kind.  If ships were to be made ""Wonders of the World"" the OASIS would be the greatest thus far.  We look forward to doing this again next year."
5.0	Sail Date: Jun 01, 2010 /	This has been my husband and I 3rd cruise and when we seek to take a cruise vcation, we look for the largest ship sailing and The Oasis Of the Sea lives up to it's name.  Oasis.  We promised our granddaughter if she would perform above average in her school work, we would take her on a cruise. Well she proved us that she could and made honor roll throughout the 2009-2010 school year.  When we boarded the ship, she thought she was in another world. I must say she's 7 years old and working on her next summer vacation towards another cruise. The staff was outstanding, and address any needs we may have needs for.  The Adventure floor on the 14th deck was her favorite and the 6th with johnnie rocket with the merry go round which she just could not get enough of. Loved the 70's night on the promanade deck, brought back old memories.  From it all I would highly recommend this ship and looking forward in boarding the Allure next summer.  Enjoyed every bit of it the cruise.
5.0	Sail Date: May 29, 2010 /	"p
	Husband and I booked this trip about 1 month before it sailed. There were still spots for shows and dining with 30 days left.
p
	Had a blast, so much to do on this ship. great for families, young couples, empty nesters, retirees, etc. Anyone can have fun on this floating amusement park (I mean that in a good way).
p
	We went on the cruise for the ship and NOT the ports. Flowrider was great to use on port days because most of the ship was off exploring, we stayed on and surfed until 11am (when they clsoe it down for a few hours).
p
	Ice Show was great, AquaTheater is amazing!
p
	Loved all the dining options, plenty were included in the original price of the cruise. Don#39;t listen to people that tell you everything is an upcharge! It#39;s not.

	Can#39;t say enough positive things about this ship and trip."
4.0	Sail Date: May 22, 2010 /	"Oasis is an over-the-top ship.  There is much to do and they keep it lively.  More important, they have perfected management of the crowds.  Only on the first afternoon while waiting for our cabin to be ready did we have any sense of the facilities being stressed.

We chose an inside balcony cabin overlooking the Boardwalk, Aqua Theater and back of ship.  We feared that it might be noisy, however, was not.  The cabin is well sound proof so noise from the carosuel, nightclub and other was never a problem.  Only problem, ship is so large that with an inside cabin, you are nor really aware of being on a cruise; could have been a land based hotel.

Entertainment was excellent.  Hairspray was good, Ice show wonderful and Aqua show exciting.  This was best entertainment of the dozen cruises we have taken.

Food was only average and probably the only disappointing part of experience.  Central Park specialty resturarent (extra cost) was very good but buffet and main dining far from standard of other ships we have been on.  This was our first RC cruise so we are waiting on next to see if all are this average.

One highlight was the way the large number of people were handled.  Check-in was best we have ever experienced with no wait and disembarking was efficient and without incedent.  RC was wise to build the special terminal to accomodate this large ship.  Overall good experience and we will probably repeat on tiis ship or sister when launched later this year."
3.0	Sail Date: May 01, 2010 /	The ship is an awesome experience but once is enough.  I have been on several cruises on various lines.  The public areas are not large enough to accommodate  the number of guests.  There is almost no access to being able to walk around an outer deck.  The walking track is the only deck that goes around the ship and it has limited access and is not a good place to stroll and enjoy.  We really missed being able to step outside and easily enjoy the view.
3.0	Sail Date: May 01, 2010 /	"If you want to expend a lot of money just to say that you have been in the largest ship in the world, its perfect.
Shows are very good.
But food its normal. Service in general its poor.
You need to pay for a lot of extras.
After 23 cruises that I take in my life I prefer to cruise in smaller ships with better food and service.
In the Oasis you are just a number more."
5.0	Sail Date: Apr 03, 2010 /	"Great Ship!  Will be booking this ship again and we try her sister.

(Pros) - Loved the Viking Crown Lounge, what a view with nice comfortable couches.  Nice place to meet people and have a relaxing drink.  Tried all the restaurants, no complaints on the food

(Cons) - RC allowed people to book online for shows.  Many people booked same shows multipule times and then only went to one.  This caused all the shows to be fulled booked, yet only half the seats were taken.  The crew wouldn't let anyone take any emplty seat for fear the people who reservsed the seats would show up.  Complained to RC management at the end of the cruise and they comped us for it."
3.0	Sail Date: Apr 01, 2010 /	"We found the Oasis to be impressive and almost overwhelming.  Overall we prefer the Freedom, it is a more imtimate environment and the rooms are much bigger.  The ship is so focused on ""spend more money with us"" from the huge shopping and dining areas.  It would have been nice to see less square footage for the mall and extra dining and more space in the rooms.  The tops floors have phenominal set up to capture the views and even though the ship was carrying thousand of people, it never felt that way.  You could always find a chair at the pool and there were minimal lines.."
5.0	Sail Date: Apr 01, 2010 /	The ship was simply elegant, clean, large, and so much fun.
5.0	Sail Date: Apr 01, 2010 /	OASIS BY THE SEA, A GREAT SHIP WITH PLENTY OF THINGS TO DO. FOOD WAS EXCELLENT AS WAS THE SERVICE. FOR A TRIP TO THE CARIBBEAN I HIGHLY RECOMEND THIS SHIP
5.0	Sail Date: Apr 01, 2010 /	"We just returend home from a trip on the Oasis of the Seas.  It was a perfect vacation.  From the moment we walked into the pier at Ft. Lauderdale, I knew that my fears of too many people and lines was moot.  We were whisked through in no time and then were able to enter the ship on the Promenade Deck, which was just beatiful.  Already, I knew we were in for  a visual treat.  The entire ship has a new suprise around every corner: from the Park Deck to the Boardwalk! Our room, a balcony, albiet, small still had everything we needed to enjoy our stay.  The colors of the ships decor were the usual RCCL calming aquas and blue pallette, which was so well done. We had the oppurtunity to dine at Giovonnis for lunch and it was worth every penny!  I only wish we had made reservations before disembarking at some of the other restaurants, since Chops was full the entire week!  Our dining was wonderful and the food was better than any I have had on a cruise ship in some time!  The shows were well done and very entertaining.  They have done an excellent job of moving away from the ""usual"" cruise ship entertainment. We enjoyed them all. Whether you are young or old, you will find something to enjoy on the ship.  You will not feel like one in 5,000 but rather a special guest.  We loved our entire Oasis experience!"
5.0	Sail Date: Apr 01, 2010 /	"We had a wonderful experience for our first cruise.  The Oasis of the Seas lived up to our every expectation.  It was beautiful, clean, elegant and easy to get any place we wanted.  The staff was friendly and helpful and we bonded especially with our cabin attendant and assistant waiter.  Our stateroom was larger than expected and again, clean and elegant with plenty of space for storage, lounging and being comfortable.  Food and choices of places was plentiful, pleasant and good~we especially enjoyed our evening dining in the Main Dining room.  Entertainment was plentiful and fantastic!

The only negative thing I have to say is I was disappointed in the beach excursions.  The beaches were nothing special, we were not treated special and even witnessed an actual fist fight between 2 locals just a few feet from us on one beach.  We went as a family group of eight on this cruise and the men and boys in our family had much better experiences with their excursions.

All in all a GREAT vacation and I can't wait to go again~to the western Caribbean!"
5.0	Sail Date: Apr 01, 2010 /	We are booked to go next year April 2011. Loved this ship and can't wait to see it again.
5.0	Sail Date: Apr 01, 2010 /	"As many passengers as she carries, the Oasis never once felt crowded. There are so many areas and choices of different things to do, people are never all in the same place at the same time.
Food was outstanding. We ate in the My Time dining room every night. We felt like the food was so good there, why pay to go one of the specialty restaurants?
Entertainment was fabulous. Loved the production of Hairspray and the Aqua Theater show.
Staff were very friendly, courteous, and helpful. Check-in was a breeze. We literally walked right in and were on the ship in about 10 minutes. For departure, we opted for the Express Walk Off because we had an early flight and we were able to be off the ship by 6:30am. Couldn't have gone more smoothly.
I have already recommended Royal Caribbean and the Oasis in particular to all my friends and family.  Can't wait to go back!"
